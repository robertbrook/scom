	<i>Amendment proposed</i> [
	<i>this day</i>] No. 12, in page 2, line 9, at end insert—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"(and also that the person is under no obligation to answer any question or give any statement other than to give his name and address)".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>—[
	<i>Mr. Harry Ewing.</i>]</p>

	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee adjourned I was on my feet and I am still on my feet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned with the question whether the person should be given a caution of some kind, and with this amendment, that the person is under no obligation to answer any question or give any statement other than to give his name and address. That is crucial in the whole process of detention, arrest, and, as we shall see, in judicial examination. This is the beginning of the chain which, up to now, has been fairly tight, binding, and with a good many safeguards. We are now beginning a chain in which some of those safeguards are being loosened. First, we have detention, meaning detention without the legal redress of other safeguards of arrest. Clause 1(2)(
	<i>b</i>) states that the constable
	<br><blockquote><p>"notes any explanation proffered by the person."</p></blockquote>
Whether or not the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) was right—and I think that most people would not regard him as being right—what is true and is in the Bill is the statement that the constable notes any explanation proffered by the person. Our amendment to delete that was opposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or may.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or may, certainly. We have not reached that stage of compulsion, even with this Government. The constable may note any explanation proffered by the person. Secondly, when the Solicitor-General opposes such an amendment, it must be for a purpose. It is not for the sake of the constable writing his memoirs. It is for some kind of use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is precisely what we seek to prevent. Somebody in front of a constable in those circumstances, whether before or after he reaches the police station, must be given a proper caution. That person is under no obligation to answer any questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Thomson report assumed that that is exactly what would happen. Paragraph 7.12 states on page 32:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are satisfied that whatever the state of the law the police do question and will continue to question suspects."</p></blockquote>
In other words, it was partly because of this prevailing habit of constables that it is time to legalise it. If that was the argument, it is a bit late to tell us that this is not legalising it and it will not happen. The report goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend in paragraph 7.13
	<i>b</i>. that the suspect should be cautioned before such interrogation and it would not be fair to found upon his refusal to answer questions which he has been told he need not answer."</p></blockquote>
This section of the report clearly refers to the handling of the suspect from the moment of his first involvement with the constable. The report goes on to define what should happen under paragraph 7.13.
	<i>b</i>. Our reading of the Bill is that that will happen. Otherwise the Solicitor-General for Scotland would not have resisted the Opposition's amendment to delete (2)(
	<i>b</i>) "notes any explanation". The report, on page 32, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before being questioned the suspect must have been cautioned."</p></blockquote>
It then goes on to define the nature of the caution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only the Thomson committee that has assumed that, but the Bill. That invalidates the argument of the hon. Member for South Angus that that would not be admissible. We also have the word of the Solicitor-General for Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not inclined generally to quote the past utterances of Tories, either out of office or in office, unless it is done at such length and in such language that it admits of no prevarication on the question. That is what happened in the course of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0162">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
previous Bill. In column 43 the Solicitor-General for Scotland, then the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire, refers to a suspect apprehended by a constable for detention and says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At this stage, nobody has been charged with anything. They do not know whether it is mobbing and rioting, murder, pick-pocketing, spitting in the street or what it is—they have just a general vague view about something.—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; c. 43.]</p></blockquote>
This vagueness is continued in clause 4(1), which says that a person has to be informed only of a suspicion and the general nature of the offence. The generality and vagueness to which the Solicitor-General objected in the previous Labour Bill is repeated here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To ask somebody to give an explanation without warning, when he does not know whether he may end up on a charge of murder or of public nuisance, seems a dangerous provision. The Solicitor-General is not only attacking its validity, but is going further and stressing its danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the matter does not end there. In 1979 the present Solicitor-General for Scotland said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I stress that it is important that a person should be warned at this very early stage"—</p></blockquote>
that refers to the picking up of the suspect—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that he need not give an explanation to a police officer, but at the same time I would not accept the amendment in its present form."—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; c.38.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. and learned Gentleman was objecting to the amendment brought in by, I think, the Scottish Nationalist Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson), because it contained certain sanctions, as did others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When these are put together, the Solicitor-General is stressing not only in layman's terms that it is a danger, but that at the very early stage the person should not be required to give an explanation. He uses the precise phrase, not just a caution, but a warning. Therefore, not merely informing, but beginning to use a legalistic term to define it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That might seem enough, but the Solicitor-General said more, and that brings out the gravamen of our charge that the Bill is hostile to proper law and order. Before the quotation I have just
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
given, the Solicitor-General said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But where a police officer, who is, so to speak, on one side of the battle, makes allegations about explanations which a person subsequently denies, that does nothing for the cause of justice."— [
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; c.38.]</p></blockquote>
There are two points here. One is a recognition of that point, buttressed by the Solicitor-General's legal argument and his warning that this of itself is against the cause of justice—in other words, against the proper implementation of law and order—and the other is a recognition that in the earlier Bill, which was in a similar form to this Bill and contained no substantial change or change for the worse, he expected that the policeman would refer precisely to those explanations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If these explanations are to be referred to, it must be in the course of later and more judicial examination, whether in the form of judicial examination or the court case. This is precisely what he is referring to and nothing else, and it cannot be avoided. He can say that he no longer believes that; what he cannot try to tell the Committee is that this is not really what he meant. It is, indeed, what he meant, and if he has changed his mind he has to give us an explanation. He may convince us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, again to buttress our argument, he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"And it does nothing for the reputation of the police or, indeed, the interests of the public."— [
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee;</i> 23 January 1979; c.38.]</p></blockquote>
Our opposition to this part of the Bill arises precisely because of its harm to the reputation of the police and to the interests of the public, and the question of the effect on the relationship of both. At that point, and on this matter, the Solicitor-General was firmly, strongly, powerfully on our side, explicitly as well as implicitly, but he has changed his mind and he must now tell us why to see whether he can convince us. That he was right to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that on this we shall get support from the Solicitor-General—that will be difficult now—and from the galaxy of advocates opposite. I confess that I take a political view on this. We no longer have a majority of advocates opposite, it appears, but, even so, I hope that on this occasion the remainder will join us. We are not making sharply political points about this. We are concerned—led and instructed as we were by the Solicitor-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0163">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
General—with the questions of justice and law and order, and the maintenance of a decent, orderly society. I would also hope to have the support of the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart), although I see that he is not here, who has been voting in an extremely reactionary fashion throughout the proceedings on the Bill. The amendment which seeks to bring a caution, a warning of silence into this problem of explanation to the police officer was in fact brought in by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason why I am encouraged to believe that we shall receive support from hon. Members opposite is that there is good reason to suppose that this proposal runs counter to the European Convention on Human Rights. In fact, the convention is referred to on page 316 of the Thomson report, which accepts the question of detention and argues the case for its retention. The report says that the committee wants to use it in cases where
	<br><blockquote><p>"the detaining constable has reasonable cause to suspect the detainee of having committed an offence for which there is power to arrest without warrant. This … is the criterion for arrest without warrant in England and Wales".</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that this would comply with the provisions of the European Convention of Human Rights, article 5(1)(
	<i>c</i>), which provides for the
	<br><blockquote><p>"lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence".</p></blockquote>
It ties up the argument on detention precisely with this question of bringing people forward in order to be subject to judicial examination in one form or another. This ties up with 5(1)(
	<i>c</i>) of the European Convention on Human Rights which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so".</p></blockquote>
This is why the Thomson committee is accepting the question of lawful detention. But article 5(3) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1(
	<i>c</i>) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power."</p></blockquote>
In other words, this is seen as the process of bringing the detainee before an exam-
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
ination of one kind or another. France is adopting one form, which we are now trying to imitate in Scotland, that of judicial examination. In no case did Thomson or the European Convention on Human Rights envisage the beginnings of an explanation during this period. The Committee must remember that this is before the detainee even enters the police office for the purpose of examination. But this is written into the Bill. Subsection (2)(
	<i>b</i>) states that the constable may note
	<br><blockquote><p>"any explanation proffered by the person".</p></blockquote>
The process of a kind of extra-judicial examination is beginning with his noting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no use in saying there is no "shall" but there is "may". Of course the constable is to exercise his discretion; hence the word "may". But it is also true that if the constable is entitled to inform the person about the general nature of the offence, that of itself begins a colloquy—a discussion—between him and the prisoner in which the prisoner has been notified only of that, not in the form of a caution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsection (1)(
	<i>a</i>), if he has already spoken to the detainee, the constable
	<br><blockquote><p>"may ask him for an explanation"—</p></blockquote>
so the investigation is beginning. The moment a constable stops someone, therefore using the power of detention, and asks him to give an explanation of his circumstances, that is the beginning of the judicial process, confirmed by noting any such explanation, and carried out by the failure to write a caution into the clause. If this is the chain that is being built up, we ask that the proper safeguards, which do not even challenge the question of detention but are in line with the whole question of detention advocated by the Solicitor-General by word as well as by intent, be provided and a caution be given. I regard this as a very serious matter, and I hope that Conservative hon. Members will support us. In paragraph 7.12 Thomson underlines this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland (Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before he reads paragraph 7.12, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will look at the beginning of the chapter. He is dealing with interrogation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that we are dealing with all stages of the interrogation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
of a suspect. I am saying that the interrogation starts from the moment of detention. The Committee must remember that we are giving power to detain. The interrogation has started and the constable may ask for an explanation of the circumstances. The word "interrogation" in Thomson is used as a general word for the beginning of the clause which deals with this process. It does not deal with the point at which the man is arrested or charged and a judicial examination takes place. It is the whole chain of interrogation, including any explanation offered. This is evident, it is here, and I cannot see how it can be questioned, even by the hon. Member for South Angus, who may challenge it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to be convinced of it, because I want there to be unity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 7.14 of the Thomson report— I mention this in case it is thought that "interrogation" referred only to a judicial examination, which the Solicitor-General now suggests—states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The previous paragraph applies to answers made in response to questions by the police."</p></blockquote>
In other words, it is not referring to judicial examination, but rather to the process of arrest and investigation by the police, part of which process is detention, because the process of interrogation starts with detention. If Conservative hon. Members had read their own Bill they would see that it states that the constable
	<br><blockquote><p>"may ask him for an explanation of the circumstances which have given rise to the … suspicion"</p></blockquote>
and may note the explanation. That is the beginning of the interrogation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because there is in the Bill as a legal factor the question of detention, any arguments subsisting in Thomson with regard to interrogation must be covered within detention. He saw it that way and confirms it that way, as does the European Convention on Human Rights. The hon. Member for Dundee, East in putting forward his amendment also saw it that way. I am pleased to see the hon. Member for Western Isles in his place. Clearly on this occasion he must support the proposition that anyone brought under detention, and therefore within police custody in one form or another, must be subject to the usual warning and caution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
It is with great confidence that I submit myself to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not the clumsy fly that the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) cast just before lunch that forces me to rise. I am concerned that the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) has failed to understand the point at issue or the controversy which I had raised with the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar). What worries me is that vital issue of admissibility before the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present position, as I understand it, is that the police may ask any questions at any time they wish. But if they ask those questions and have arrested the person, or he was already under suspicion earlier, if they interrogate him at that stage, where they put themselves at peril is that anything usefully obtained from the suspect or the accused is of no legal value, because it cannot be adduced in the prosecution against him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I understood the hon. Member for Garscadden to suggest was that simply because under clause 1 for the first time the police were being given statutory rights to stop someone and ask "What is your name and address?" and "May we ask you for an explanation", the legal character of the statement obtained would in some way be different. I was attempting to find out how he had reached that view. Given the introduction of clause 1, the common law of Scotland relating to the admissibility of statements would in no way be altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give an example. If while walking along the street a police officer sees a jeweller's window open and a man climbing out of it with a silver candelabra under his arm, and asks the man "What is your name and address?", and then says "I should you like to give an explanation", it seems to me that at that stage suspicion has so focused on that person that any statement he then makes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not take too much subtlety to see what is happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. If at that stage suspicion had so focused on that man that at a subsequent prosecution the police sought to lead evidence of what he had said in a statement, that evidence would be utterly worthless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
I see nothing in clause 1 which changes the common law of Scotland. What the hon. Member for Garscadden said was little more than idle and casual speculation that in one way or another the Court of Appeal in Edinburgh would give a particular character to statements obtained in the circumstances in which the powers under clause 1 were operated. I feel strongly that there is nothing whatever in the clause to indicate that that is the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What if, following the explanation given on the street, the man is then taken into custody or arrested and given a formal warning, and thereafter during their interrogation the police note down and use questions and answers that were given at the initial stage before the warning was given? Would those questions and answers, and any contradiction between them if they came up in evidence before a court, be admissible? That is a question that must be answered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking about interrogation; I say that with respect to the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West. The police have a lot of evidence, and suspicion has well and truly focused on the person. It is not only a matter of giving him a caution. In those circumstances, the police have to be careful that they do not interrogate—or in the words of Chalmers—pass beyond that into true cross-examination and interrogation. If they do that, whether or not the power exists under the provisions of clause 1, evidence which could be most valuable in their prosecution will be lost, because, according to the broad test, it will have been unfairly obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understood that the hon. Member for Garscadden was attempting to draw a distinction. It is an interesting legal speculation, if nothing else. I do not see that there is any validity in his argument about admissibility of evidence. The common law of Scotland is not altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the hon. Gentleman is saying that not warning the individual would allow the police to make investigations which, although the statement itself would not be admissible, might nevertheless enable the police to put their case together in a better way, that is an interesting point. At one stage, I thought that that was the line which the hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
was seeking to pursue. If that had been so, it would have been a more worthwhile elaboration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, any argument that the hon. Gentleman has sought to put forward on admissibility of evidence is utterly without foundation and any attempt to refer to Chalmers, Miln v Cullen or any other case does not bear out what he seemed to suggest would be the effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram), who said that if the drafting amendments that have been proposed were introduced, they would bring in a novel and dangerous idea. If the full, true and proper caution is not given, surely the police imperil themselves. A statement taken by the police, however valuable it might be to the prosecution, would not be admissible evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to know whether the hon. Member for Garscadden is suggesting that if the police were to give this slightly woolly, slightly wet caution under the provisions of clause 1, any statement taken in those circumstances would be admissible. If he wishes to protect the individual accused person so that he may resist the powers of the police, it would seem far better and safer that he should have the existing caution and common law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting legal argument. I am grateful to the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) for breaking his silence on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the question of admissibility of evidence is important, and is one of the two central issues that we are discussing, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will turn his thoughts to another central issue. Why are the hon. Gentleman and his Government so keen to define the relationship of the police to the suspected person without producing a similar definition in regard to the suspected person and his relationship to the police?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Gentleman accept that when discussing the question, the Thomson committee suggested that there should be two cautions? One was the general caution that my hon. Friends and I are keen to write into the Bill. The committee also suggested that once the police officer's suspicions were confirmed and he was more sure in his own mind that the suspected person was the perpetrator of the crime, a second and more elaborate caution should be given.

The admissibility of evidence is important, but the relationship and rights of the police vis-a-vis the suspected accused person and the suspected accused person's rights vis-a-vis the police should surely both be spelt out, and not just the one. In clause 1 we spell out only the responsibilities of the police officer and not that of the suspected person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to take up more time than I should in making what I hope will be a brief intervention, but I wish to answer a fair point made by the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth. If I were the chief constable of Strathclyde or the police lecturer at Tulliallan and was explaining to young constables about the new power that was to be given to them under clause 1, the one point that I would be saying to them over and over would be "if you seek to exercise this power that is given to you, you should make jolly sure that you give the suspect a caution and not just the slightly loose one that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden wishes for, because, if you do not, once you get into court you may find that the statement is inadmissible." The whole point is that that is the existing law of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not seek to make a cheap point, but either the amendment is badly drafted or, alternatively, the hon. Member for Garscadden is trying to introduce not one of the two types of caution that the Thomson committee was talking about but a third one, namely, one that says "It is not quite as serious yet as you think. Suspicion has not fallen on you and we have not got to the stage of admissibility of evidence"—a shadow caution, as it were. Once an explanation has been given of something that might be incriminating, is the proposal that the police officer should stop and say "That's interesting. I must give you the full and complete caution before you say anything further"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to say a few words later on the more sophisticated points raised by the hon. Gentleman, but on the half-baked, inadequate, stupid caution which we are accused of trying to write into the Bill the hon. Gentleman will no doubt have examined in some detail the Law Society's recommendations on the clause and have seen on page 3 of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
submissions that it is making exactly the same recommendation. Would the hon. Gentleman care to comment on why it is wrong and how it came to this wrong conclusion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not want to comment on it, because there are a number of points I would want to make about the Law Society's submissions which would take very much longer than the tolerance of my Whip would permit; and, having very nearly secured a free transfer after the Tenants' Rights Bill, I do not believe that that is incumbent upon me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the hon. Gentleman the Member for Garscadden I say that this matter, has not been thought through. I cannot see—nor have I had an answer on this from anybody—where there is any problem about the existing law of Scotland. If the hon. Member for Garscadden feels that there is a problem in the existing law of Scotland, I suggest that he should be looking for a new clause to be put into the Bill relating to cautions and the circumstances in which they are to be given. To bring that in solely in relation to clause 1 is not a proper answer to his objections to the existing law, if, indeed, those objections are valid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I again refer the hon. Gentleman to paragraph 7.13 of the Thomson report which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend that it should be competent for the Crown to lead evidence of statements made by a suspect before arrest in answer to police questioning."</p></blockquote>
The report recommended its admissibility before arrest, but we are now writing into the Bill a new process before arrest—the process of detention. Therefore, a process of questioning is seen and is said to be admissible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We further recommend that the admissibility of such evidence should be subject to the following qualifications."</p></blockquote>
Among those qualifications is the following:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before being questioned the suspect must have been cautioned."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fraser</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. So what? I do not understand the point made by the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West. He keeps digging in and out of the report of the Thomson Committee, but he should be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
beginning at the start of chapter 7 and reading through to what are the problems in the existing law of Scotland relating to interrogation—that is what it is called.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent interrogation has in law, as I understand it, with confessions and admissibility of evidence, become something of an art. One can see it in Chalmers and it is referred to in Hartley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned here, I should have thought, with a more valid and delicate point. There is a quotation from Milne v. Cullen on page 31 of the Thompson Committee report which suggests that it does not necessarily follow that because a suspect has not been cautioned that the statement obtained is unfairly obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden has a specific and separate point to make about the desirability of all suspects being cautioned before any statement is rendered admissible he should make that the subject of a separate amendment at a later stage, and possibly of a new clause. I am not saying that I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but if that is his objection he should do it in that way. To seek to introduce that proposal in clause 1 is to introduce a tangle. It would not help matters because that would leave the matter of statements obtained from suspects not under the exercise of this power in disarray, if it be disarray, as the existing law is at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that I am getting increasingly confused as the debate continues. I am confused not because I am not following the arguments expressed by Government hon. Members but because of the obvious division of opinion in the legal profession. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) seems to have some difference with the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser). The Solicitor-General appears to be confused between what he said last year and this year. It is disturbing that the legal profession appears to be split right down the middle—like the Conservative Party itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would help if we appealed to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) to give an authoritative counsel's opinion on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: From what the hon. Gentleman said in the debates last year
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
I do not think he is capable of making an authoritative statement. The issue of admissibility of evidence was made clear by him then. He suggested that one should not start collecting the Crown's case on the street by getting explanations —not interrogations—without warning that people need not give them at that stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the Solicitor-General said last year. If he says that one is starting to collect the Crown's case, surely it must be clear that one is collecting evidence that is admissible; otherwise it would not be part of the Crown's case. If it is not admissible, it is not the Crown's case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the Solicitor-General said and I shall be interested to hear what he now says. I warn him that standing on his head would do a great deal of harm to his usual sartorial elegance if he does so for any length of time. That is what he appears to be about to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Solicitor-General going to pick up the point made by the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser)? I am sure the Opposition would be happy to withdraw the amendment if we had a clear indication from the Solicitor-General that on Report he will introduce an amendment which gives an even stronger warning than proposed in our amendment. No one in the Opposition would object to that, but I feel that we shall not get it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This confusion continues. The Law Society is opposed to what the Government Members are saying. Government Members may have no high regard for the Law Society, but the Law Society states that it approves of clause 1 in principle. Unlike some of us, who have objected in principle to parts of clause 1, the Law Society accepts the principles behind it. However, it goes on to say that two reasonable amendments are required. Both of those the Opposition have sought to introduce, and both have been refused by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should have thought that the Law Society is just as knowledgeable on the admissibility of evidence as the advocates opposite. They may not think so, but the Law Society probably thinks so. I know that I have a member of the Law Society sitting beside me, and I am sure that that is how he feels. The Law Society often deals with clients at a much earlier stage than do Government Members, and therefore has a closer relationship with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
the police collection of evidence than have Government Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Glasgow Bar Association made exactly the same point. It, too, had some reservations on this clause, although largely accepting it in principle. But it made exactly the same point as the Law Society—that there ought to be an amendment to ensure that a warning of some sort or another was given to the police before anyone was questioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What authorities are we going on. We are going on the authority of the present Solicitor-General for Scotland last year, when he was Opposition spokesman? We are going on the basis of the Law Society, the Glasgow Bar Association and the Thomson Report, on which part I of the Bill is based. It is not unreasonable, immoderate or revolutionary to take the word of any of those sources when putting forward an amendment. This is one of the more reasonable of the amendments that we have tabled. I hope that the Solicitor-General will consider it carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by making one further point. This is a genuine query which I raised with the hon. Member for South Argus. There will be a stage between the interrogation or questioning of a suspect on the streets and that suspect's appearing in court, where hon. Gentlemen come into contact with him. That is the stage of questioning by the police after, or during, a period of detention, or after he has been charged when, as Thomson says, questioning will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that an explanation made on the streets may be rather different to the explanation given by the person when he is in the police station and has had a couple of hours to think about it. But if the person has given an explanation without warning the police will presumably be able to question him on the fact that the two explanations do not marry up. There should be a warning so that the person does not make statements that are contradicted at a later stage of questioning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to appreciate that there is a stage—which the lawyers may not always be so concerned about, particularly if they are advocates—between the picking up on the street and that person's appearing in court on a specific charge. We have to be aware of the problems in that period when we are considering the giving of a warning on the streets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I begin my brief reply to the debate by reminding the Opposition of the amendment which was moved by the then hon. Member for Dundee, East in the debate in which hon. Gentlemen have quoted some of the things from which I said I would not depart. The amendment proposed that the suspect should be advised that while he was under no obligation to give an explanation under paragraph (
	<i>a</i>), if he failed to do so he might be required by the constable to accompany him to a police station or other premises. That amendment clearly was putting a weight on the witness to give a statement because he was being threatened that if he did not give an explanation he would be detained. That would result in inadmissible evidence, whether or not a caution had been given. It would be unfair even after a caution, far less beforehand. That was why I opposed it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What particularly interested me in those who are anxious to quote what I said was that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) did not suggest that there should be a statutory warning at that stage. The hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) did not suggest it, and I did not suggest it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Solicitor-General give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I want to get on for the moment. I think it is important to remember that as I said before—I want to be brief, and hon. Members can remember what I said at our sitting last Thursday. There are innumerable circumstances which arise from the concept of when a constable suspects. He may suspect from a situation of innocence; he may suspect from a situation of guilt; he may suspect from a whole spectrum of things in between. It is, clearly, in the interests of a person with an innocent explanation, such as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) going along with his collar up, wearing no tie, carrying a briefcase, when a constable says to him "Can I see what is in your briefcase?", and his replying "Certainly you can". But if the policeman before asking to see inside the briefcase says "You need not say anything and anything you do say will be taken down and may be used in evidence", the hon. Member for Cathcart may be unwise enough to say "No, you cannot look into my briefcase".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then what would happen is what was anticipated by the hon. Member for Dundee, East, that the constable would say "The only reason why an innocent
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
person will not show me what is inside his briefcase is because there is something in it that there should not be. So my suspicions are so aroused that you fall into the category of section 2 and I will detain and take you to a police station. There I will have power to look into your briefcase."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one takes the Costello situation, it would have been absurd to have said to Costello "I warn you that you need not say anything, but what is in that parcel?" because if Costello had said "I'm not saying anything" the policeman would have arrested him because he did not account for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are things that must be understood by the Committee if the absolute safeguard is removed which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) said, is the safeguard of the ultimate test of fairness and the amendment is put down, which he described accurately as a hybrid caution because it is not a caution to what the consequence will be. Nor does it even give a person the opportunity of knowing that what he says will be recorded—which may be why he gives it in the first place. Even for those reasons I would have opposed the amendment. But the point is this, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central, knows— it does not alter the law of admissibility in any way at all. Caution may or may not affect admissibility. There are different circumstances at different stages in each case at which the absence of caution may render what is said inadmissible. There are other circumstances in which the absence of caution will not render what is said inadmissible, and there are also circumstances in which what is said—however often, as Lord Cooper said in 
	<i>Chalmers,</i> the caution is repeated—cannot cure the fundamental wrongness of the methods by which the information was obtained. No number of cautions—if I remember correctly what he said—merely because it is a caution, will affect the admissibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, therefore, four circumstances. Either it is admissible on caution or it is inadmissible on caution, or it is admissible without caution or it is inadmissible without caution. The circumstances in which one cautions and the circumstances in which one does not are matters ever in the mind of a policeman, because he knows, and his superiors never let him forget, that important evidence may be lost if he obtains it in a manner—and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
caution is an element in this—which could be said to be unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the reverse does not apply, and the Crown would never say "He made a statement under interrogation which was unfair, but the statement was exculpatory, but we object because it was incompetently obtained." That could never happen. So the balance of fairness is always on the side of the accused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should, in passing, say to my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South, since he confused the hon. Member for Garscadden with the hon. Member for South Ayrshire, and the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) with the hon. Member for South Angus, that anyone who can be confused on such a spectrum of mental agility must inevitably be of great benefit to our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that this amendment would be wise. It would make it much more difficult for the courts to apply the doctrine of fairness. If one put into statute in this circumstance the necessity in all circumstances, which so vastly vary, for a statutory caution, one would call in question the necessity for a caution in all sorts of other statutory proceedings in which such a concept is not there. I rest on the fact that the hon. Member for Garscadden and the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) saw no necessity for it the last time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stand by the words that I said before— that it is wise of the police, in all circumstances, if they think that a person is likely to make a damaging admission against himself in circumstances in which suspicion, in the proper sense, has focused on him, to give a caution. All policemen know that, because if they do not do so they may imperil the validity of their evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what one should do about arguments from the Solicitor-General. He seems determined to ignore his own words at the previous Committee, and to give a quite convoluted meaning to what seemed to me to be the plainest of quotations that was given to him by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we would let that pass. What I genuinely object to is when the hon. and learned Gentleman starts imputing to myself and to my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
Ewing) inconsistencies and a failure to argue a case in the previous Committee which we patently did argue. That seems to me to be the height of discourtesy and almost unforgivable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On behalf of my hon. Friend and myself, let me read into the record what happened in that debate. The Solicitor-General got one thing right. It was an amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) which asked that there should be a specific caution to the effect that the person did not need to reply. It went on to say that there should be a further warning that, if he did not give an explanation, he might be taken to the police station under the powers in clause 2 of the Bill. What I said—I can only speak from the record here—was that I had a good deal of sympathy with the basic idea about the caution. I went on to argue:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is no good giving people the right to silence unless they axe told that they have that right, because there is no way in which public knowledge of criminal procedure can be assumed to give someone that knowledge."</p></blockquote>
I went on to discuss the desirability of having a caution saying that I was
	<br><blockquote><p>"100 per cent. behind the reasoning of the hon. Member for Dundee, East".</p></blockquote>
But then we expressed reservations about the sanction that he was adding on, one might say, as a tail end. In col. 35 I specifically say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the hon. Member"—</p></blockquote>
that is the hon. Member for Dundee, East—
	<br><blockquote><p>"would redraft or put down—I may well do it myself later—an amendment merely to write in that, at the point at which the man has been challenged for his explanation, he is told that he has a right to silence and also told that if he does make a reply it may be used in evidence, I would go along with that amendment."</p></blockquote>
I went on to talk about the practical difficulties about the form of drafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to bore the Committee by repeating a speech, but it is monstrous, when I expressed my sympathy with the spirit of the amendment in the last Bill, at what might be said to be almost tedious length, for the Solicitor-General to come along and then cavalierly refuse, if I may say so, even the simplest of interventions to put the record straight and merely deny that the record exists. It seems to me to be quite remarkable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In col. 44 we had a specific undertaking from the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth, when he said:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"What I would say to the Committee, if it helps, is that the Government would be prepared to look at the question of the caution if the hon. Member for Dundee (Mr. Wilson) agrees to withdraw his amendment."—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; c.34–44.]</p></blockquote>
It is crystal clear that this was canvassed, that there was Back Bench support—which I was only one person to express—and that we had a receptive ear from the Minister. I am very sad that the Solicitor-General for Scotland should have taken the line that he has. The Back Bench support was all-party support. One of the rate interventions by the hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Gray)—I make no criticism of that—who is now Minister of State, Department of Energy, made it clear that he sympathised with the need for a caution. Therefore, there was a general agreement, which, as I said earlier, we thought was the general feeling during that debate. The Minister of State may be ill today—that may be the explanation—but it is an absolute nonsense to pretend that these arguments were not advanced during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I turn very briefly to the arguments and to the interesting points made by the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser). In a sense, if I may say so—it may be partly my fault—we have gone down a bit of a blind alley with these sophistications on the question of admissibility. They arose because the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South said that this was the wrong sort of caution and we ought not to stop at the half-way house but go to the end of the road—or rather, he said that it would be more defensible if we did. He was not necessarily saying that he could support it, but that he could understand the argument for it. It was on that basis that we became involved in a lengthy argument about admissibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly clear from the quotations from page 31 in the case of Miln v Cullen that a caution is not a determining factor on admissibility or inadmissibility. Thai is perfectly clear and is stated by Lord Strachan in clear and crystal terms. I accept that the test is fairness and that the giving or otherwise of a caution is presumably something that might have a very heavy weighting in the consideration of whether it was a fair process or not, but has no other definitive effect upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seemed at one point to be a suggestion from the Government Benches that if there was interrogation or even if there was questioning—if it was not a
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
totally spontaneous and voluntary statement—it would not be admissible. I think that we are now all agreed that that is not so either. We are all familiar with plenty of cases in which there was a level of questioning which the court held in the circumstances to be fair questioning. It seems perfectly clear that an explanation offered in terms of clause 1 might be admissible, given the view that the judge took of all the surrounding circumstances, the state of mind of the accused and the situation that pertained at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the whole argument of admissibility falls if we could get—we cannot—an authoritative statement that this would never be admissible in those circumstances or in the situation to which the hon. Member for South Angus referred. It might be an interesting private line, a pointer for the police, but no more than that. But I reject that, because it could not possibly be the case. Therefore, if it might be admissible, I suggest that it would be better to encourage a caution, as he conceded that good police practice would insist upon, in order to try to bolster the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a 
	<i>recherchéé</i> civil liberties argument which says in a devious way that the caution should be left out in the hope that it will bolster the defence submission and preclude the jury from hearing the damaging admission. That is a perverse argument which I would not support. On this occasion I appear in the other Lobby. If I am satisfied that a proper caution has been given, that the man knows his rights and that at the end of the day his statement may be used in evidence against him, I am anxious that the jury should have the benefit of it. If it has been fairly obtained and is damaging, it is part of the case that should be put before the jury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly support the idea that there should be a caution, realising that it would not be automatically admissible, but that it would certainly be more likely to be so. That is right, because it would be fairly obtained in the suspect's proper knowledge of his position and rights. Even at that level, there is a strong case for a caution of some sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is a further level in the argument to which we should address our minds. It has been forgotten in the subtleties and obscurities of admissibility of evidence. It is the question of informing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
the suspect of his rights. That is basically what the amendment seeks. If a person is stopped, gives his name and address and the policeman then says "I am inquiring into a housebreaking in such and such a street and we think that you may know something about it; can you explain why you are in this area?", it is of paramount importance that the man knows not only the general nature of the inquiry and suspicion, but his rights. His most important right in that situation, if he wants to exercise it, is the right not to reply and to be sure that he is not, in that way, in breach of the law or his obligations under clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the Law Society suggested only two amendments to the clause. One was in line with amendment No. 12. It did not suggest that because its members had been in the faculty library, dancing on the head of a legal pin regarding the niceties of admissibility, but because it took the common sense, straightforward view that a person is entitled to know and be told his rights in that difficult situation. It has been suggested by more than one speaker, particularly by the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser), that this form of words is objectionable because it lacks definition, is half baked and, although perhaps well intentioned, weak and ineffective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have an amendment to clause 1, but if we made an analogy with clause 2, it would be more important to have a genuinely effective caution. On that there would be unanimity in the Committee. The caution contained in clause 7(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person detained under subsection (1) above shall be under no obligation to answer any question other than to give his name and address, and a constable shall so inform him."</p></blockquote>
That, give or take a few words, is exactly the caution that we are trying to write into clause 1. To say that the caution would be ineffective, difficult to define and additionally complex, is a nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same form of words with the same intention and, I suspect, for the same good reason, has been incorporated in clause 2 by the Solicitor-General for Scotland and his drafting colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the caution is right in clause 2, it is also right in clause 1. We should all be interested in ensuring that those suspected of an offence know their rights. The law should have a duty to inform them of their position. That is all that this caution would
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
do. It is simple, straightforward and sensible. I think that we should try to insist upon it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a long, but important debate. The Solicitor-General's reply and his defence of his change of mind since this aspect of the same sort of legislation was previously discussed was probably the poorest reply and defence that I have ever heard from him. We all expected far better and much more detailed reasons as to why he has changed his mind since the Bill was previously debated. Not only did we not get an explanation of why the Solicitor-General had changed his mind, but we got a distortion of what happened in Committee on the previous Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member bring to the notice of the Committee any record in the debates on the previous Bill where I suggested that there ought to be a statutory caution contained in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quote from column 43 of the Committee proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Statutory caution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the previous Bill, the present Solicitor-General for Scotland said—talking about the caution:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is very important, and there is one point the Committee has not heard and which I should like the hon. Member to consider."</p></blockquote>
He was addressing my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar).
	<br><blockquote><p>"At this stage, nobody has been charged with anything. They do not know whether it is mobbing and rioting, murder, pick-pocketing, spitting in the street or what it is—they just have a general vague view about something. Now, to ask somebody to give an explanation without warning"—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 23 January 1979; c.43].</p></blockquote>
If the Solicitor-General for Scotland is saying that the implication of that remark was that he did not want a warning given, that he just made that remark and it did not mean anything other than that he was worried that somebody was being asked for an explanation without warning, that is certainly not the interpretation that either the Conservative side of the Committee at that time or the then Government side of the Committee put on his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
The hon. and learned Gentleman went on to say that it was a dangerous practice to ask someone to give an explanation without first giving him a warning and telling him what he was suspected of doing. We are entitled, in absolute fairness, to draw from the hon. and learned Gentleman's remarks at that time the conclusion that he was in favour of a statutory warning being written into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When that debate was wound up, I sensed that the Committee was anxious about a caution being administered. I said that if the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) would withdraw his amendment the then Government would look at the possibility of coming back on Report with something on the question of caution and that we would not accept the threat implied by the hon. Member for Dundee, East in the second part of his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implied threat was that if the suspected person failed or refused to give his name and address, he would be taken to a police station and detained under clause 2 of the then Bill. I said that we were not prepared to accept that threat, but entering that reservation, I gave an undertaking that we would come back to the matter on Report. It was on that basis that the amendment was withdrawn. So there was no doubt in my mind that the Committee—including the present Solicitor-General for Scotland—was in favour of a caution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this debate has proceeded there has, apart from the remarks of my hon. Friends the Members for Garscadden and Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), been no concern for the individual in this situation. All we have is a constant argument about what is admissible or inadmissible when taking a case to a court of law. As I suspected, it is a lawyer's field day. That is what this legislation is rapidly becoming. Clause 1 is not primarily concerned with what is admissible or inadmissible in evidence in a court of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that even the Solicitor-General for Scotland would agree that clause 1 defines the police powers. We are merely arguing that as well as defining police powers we should define the rights of those who are suspected by the police of having committed a crime. The Bill says that clause 1 is about that. The title of clause 1 is "Suspect or potential witness may be required by a constable to identify himself", and the title of Part I of the Bill is
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
"Police powers". We say that there must be a balance. We ask that the suspected person's rights should be written into the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not quote Thomson but I shall paraphrase him. Thomson says that a hardened, sophisticated criminal knows his rights. I agree with the lawyers on the Conservative Benches that such people know that they need only give their name and address, no more, and that will be the end of it. However, someone who comes for the first time into a confrontation with the police does not know his rights. He is not sure of his position. In such a hot situation—as we often mentioned in our discussions on the previous Bill—a person faced for the first time by a policeman who says "I want your name and address and an explanation of why you are here and what you are doing" will pour everything out, whether it is incriminating or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are saying merely that it is at least in order to try to educate people that they have rights. I do not even suggest that people will queue at the Stationery Office to buy the Bill and read the rights that they have, but at least we have a chance of getting through to some people that in such a situation they, as well as the police, have rights. Our amendment is about defining those rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the hon. Gentleman saying that we have got it wrong because we are talking about the effect on a future trial. He may remember that the last time this Committee met he was speaking about Subsection (2)(
	<i>b</i>). He may remember mentioning something which worried him:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nor does he say"</p></blockquote>
—the policeman, that is—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the accused or suspected person, according to the Legislation we are now discussing, that any explanation may well be used in evidence and could be submitted as part of the Crown's case if a trial were to follow."—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 24 April 1980; c.81.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman may remember that I was nodding at him and he remarked on it in his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that we were making on the Government side of the Committee is that the hybrid caution in this amendment does not satisfy any ground. It does not satisfy the ground that the hon. Gentleman himself raised the other day, and it is not necessary on the view that a policeman will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
administer a caution. Therefore, could the hon. Gentleman reconsider his statement that we on the Government side of the Committee were mistaken in taking the view that this paragraph was about evidence in an ultimate trial? I understand from his argument yesterday that that was his view too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that the Government side of the Committee have got it all wrong. I never used those words. I said that we had the balance wrong. There must be a proper balance between the rights of the police on the one hand and the rights of the suspected individual on the other in the aspect of the Bill that we are now discussing. I conceded all along that—as I think I said—not the principal part but certainly an important part of the debate is about the admissibility of evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been trying without success to obtain from the Solicitor-General the standing of the statements that would be proffered by a suspected person under clause 1 of the Bill and would be noted by a police constable. That is an addition to this Bill. It was not written into the Labour Government's Bill. Because of these refinements, the Solicitor-General is being asked to refine the Bill still further. We ask only for the refinement that the rights of the suspected person should be written into the legislation so that anyone who goes to the trouble of studying this legislation—there will be many who do and many who do not—will see that a suspected person in the kind of hot situation we are discussing has the right only to give his name and address and no more. I cannot for the life of me understand why hon. Members on the Government Benches are resisting—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not mean anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the hon. Member's only objection, that is not a good reason for not writing it in. If all that is between us is that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) thinks that it does not mean anything, and I and my hon. Friends think that it does mean something, surely the simplest way to resolve the debate would be to write our proposal into the legislation and give suspected persons a chance of knowing that at least they have some rights in a hot situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
We are not talking about a great many people. As I explained at the beginning of the debate, we are talking about those whom a constable has decided to ask for an explanation of their presence. There is flexibility in the Bill. I conceded that to the Solicitor-General on the introduction of the word "may" where "shall" appeared in our Bill. The flexibility is there. We are talking about those who will be affected when a constable has exercised his flexible discretion. It is right and proper that their rights should be defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the life of me, I cannot understand the resistance to the amendment. I hope that as we draw near to the end of our discussions on clause 1, there will be some give and take. If the Solicitor-General is not prepared even to give an undertaking that he will look at the matter on Report, as we did, I hope that we can attract some support from the Government side to introduce this worthwhile amendment into the legislation. I advise all my hon. Friends and the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take one minute to give some final encouragement. As I understand it, the Bill was reputed to be based on the Thomson report. It is important to remember that the report sets out simply that there are three stages— one, before the police have reasonable cause to suspect a person; two, after the police have reasonable cause to suspect a person of having committed an offence, and three, when he should be charged. The second stage is the situation we are dealing with in clause 1(1), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person has committed."</p></blockquote>
That is almost word for word the second stage of the Thomson report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact, the clause covers stages one and two. If one considers the Costello situation, one does not even know that an offence has been committed. One is merely inquiring in circumstances that appear to be suspicious to see whether a crime has been committed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about the legal definition where a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
committed, or is committing, an offence. It is in that situation, defined in that way, that we must consider the amendment. That is the second stage defined in the Thomson report and identically defined in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second stage, the Thomson report recommends that there should be admissibility of evidence. We recommend that there should be competence to determine evidence of statements made by a suspect before arrest, but the report goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"before being questioned in this situation the suspect must have been cautioned."</p></blockquote>
That is clearly what Thomson said and it is what the public believed would be implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that this warning would be of value. Nevertheless it is a warning that is given under subsection (7) of clause 2. We are asking no more than that. Indeed, Conservative spokesmen went further on the previous Bill in asking for something tougher. We are asking for a minimal</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very brief in talking about the general principle of the clause which I hope to urge my hon. Friends to vote against now that we have discussed the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tabled some reasonable amendments. We were gravely concerned about the principle of its being a legal obligation on a person being stopped as a witness to give his name and address. We are still gravely concerned about that. We have seen no movement at all on the Government's part. We still believe that it is something that should not be put in the Bill because it is replacing a moral obligation with a legal obligation. It will have small gains in terms of law and order, the number of convictions that will result and the number of criminals that will be convicted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>

	<p>caution in this amendment, exactly in line with clause 2(7). The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) thought it was valueless. His Government think that it is valuable. If it is valuable, let us have it in the Bill.</p>

	<p>I wish that we could have got some response from the Solicitor-General. There are two, or possibly four, postures that a man can adopt when he is standing on his head. He can make the reasonable response that "I am standing on my head because my legs are tired". He can make the humble response "I did not know that I was standing on my head". He can make the brazen response "I am standing on my head because I choose to stand on my head". The hon. Gentleman has not even recognised that he is standing on his head. I wish he would give us some answers.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 8.</p>

	<p>We are concerned that as a result there will be some loss in the good relationship between the police and the community which could mean that law and order will get worse, not better.</p>

	<p>Outside the House people generally may have got the impression that we are opposed to the police and to law and order. That is far from being the case. We are genuinely concerned about law and order. We believe that there are different ways of doing it from those contained in the clause and in the Bill.</p>

	<p>We are also gravely concerned about the two amendments which we tabled. First, there is the lack of any limit for the time that a constable may detain a suspected person who is still on the street. It seems reasonable that it should be the 30 minutes that we put in the amendment. Again, the Government refused to move. They refused to allow any movement at all. More particularly, in the debate that we have just finished, all the evidence from all the experts—particularly the Thomson com-

	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
mittee on which the clause and the whole of part I is based—was quite clearly stating that it should be in. It was a reasonable, honourable amendment, supported by the Law Society, the Bar Association—and by the Solicitor-General last time round. Yet there was not even an attempt by the Solicitor-General to take it away and look at it, which at least would have allowed us to consider voting for the clause. He did not even move on it. He just flatly refused to move.</p>

	<p>I do not wish to enter into debate on all that again, Mr. Gourlay, and I am sure that you would rule me out of order if I did so. I am trying to state why I am now urging my hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 2, line 41, after "imprisonment", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the first instance without the option of a fine".</p></blockquote>
It is no simple form of words when I say that this is a probing amendment of which I think we can dispose in short order. Indeed, by way of an apology or confession I ought to say that it is tabled purely because the Law Society of Scotland raised a point that I did not quite understand, and I thought that the Solicitor-General might be able to elucidate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention is clear—that the power under clause 2 should be usable only if the suspicion is that there has been or is about to be committed an offence punishable by imprisonment at first instance. It did not occur to me until I read the Law Society brief that there was any need to worry about the words of the clause. But to quote from what the Law Society says</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>

	<p>which we objected and we tried to give certain safeguards to people in the situations that can arise from the clause. The Government have flatly refused to move on it.</p>

	<p>As a result, I urge my hon. Friends— there do not happen to be many of them left in the Committee Room at present, but I am glad to see my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) behind me and my hon. Friend and Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) in front of me—to vote against the clause and to try to remove it altogether from the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill:—</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 4.</p>

	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>"The Council considered clause 2(1) which provides that the constable must have reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence punishable by imprisonment, and is of the view that this should read 'punishable by imprisonment in the first instance without the option of a fine', otherwise it might bring in cases of imprisonment for failing to pay a fine."</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>I should not have thought that that was likely but, as the source that expresses the doubt in terms of the niceties of draftsmanship is probably more sophisticated and intelligent than I am, I thought it at least worth laying before the Committee, so that we could have the comments of the Solicitor-General. If he can give me a firm assurance, which I suspect he can, that the term "imprisonment" simpliciter excludes the possibility of some ingenious policeman using his powers under clause 2—even though there is no likelihood, or no possibility, of imprisonment at first instance—on the ingenious back-door argument that the person might be fined for the offence, might not pay the fine and might then go to prison, and therefor the powers would become operable, I shall be quite satisfied.</p>

	<p>That seems to be what the Law Society suspects and is proposing. I thought that it was worth giving the matter an airing, if only to put the Law Society's doubts at rest.

	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
It is in that spirit that I have moved the amendment.</p>

	<p>6.0 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) for raising this question. I trust that I can put at rest the doubts of the Law Society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I think I am right in saying that there is only one offence in this country which is punishable by imprisonment without option of a fine, and that is murder. There is no other offence to which the clause would apply if this amendment were to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, far be it from me to criticise the legal acuity of the Law Society, but the wording is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person has committed or is committing an offence punishable by imprisonment".</p></blockquote>
That is a person who is not in prison. Presumably he has not paid a fine. In not paying a fine, one does not commit an offence; one is exercising an unwise option, but one is not committing an offence. Clause 2 could not therefore be applied to someone who was in default of a fine, which would 
	<i>de facto</i> be punishable by imprisonment, but it is not an offence. I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands those two succinct answers to the Law Society's anxieties. I am quite satisfied in my own mind that it would not be legitimate under this clause to arrest a person in the circumstances of its fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not think that there was a great deal in this. I felt that on this occasion the Law Society was not on a good point. The Solicitor-General is improving. One of these days he may even be tempted to make a concession on an amendment, if this run of form continues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite satisfied for the present that there is no possibility of someone finding himself the subject of powers under clause 2 on a suspicion that at some future day he may not pay a speculative fine. I am happy to seek to withdraw the amendment and not obstruct the Committee further on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
ment No. 17, in page 2, line 43, leave out from "offence" to end of line 45.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just as amendment No. 16 was moved as a probing amendment, so I move this amendment as a probing amendment and hope that we shall get a satisfactory response from the Solicitor-General. There can be no doubt that the wording of paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) is worrying. This was not contained in the previous Bill, and we are anxious to know why it appears in this Bill. We are also anxious to know why it was thought necessary to regard the police as deciding whether criminal proceedings should be instigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From time to time, both in the Committee on the last Bill and on the Floor of the House during the Second Reading of this Bill, Scottish Members of Parliament were keen to point out the difference between Scottish and English law. In England a host of offences are prosecuted by the police themselves, whereas in Scotland the police do not prosecute any offence. The role of the police is to report the circumstances of an offence to the Procurator-Fiscal and it is for him to decide whether criminal proceedings should be instigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Solicitor-General will agree that the wording of this paragraph is worrying and indeed could easily be misinterpreted, I hope that he will agree that it needs looking at again. If he agrees that it should be deleted, that will deal with the matter now. I think that it is very important, because it deals not only with the role of the police but with the role of the procurators-fiscal. If the Solicitor-General wants to come back to it on Report, that would be acceptable to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever we do, we must clarify the position to make it clear that in Scotland the police have no responsibility for deciding whether criminal proceedings ought to be instigated against anyone. This is, has always been, and hopefully will always be, the role of the Procurator-Fiscal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) for raising his doubt. The reason for the wording of the clause is to give a person maximum notice about the purpose of his detention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question that the police will take over the Procurator-Fiscal's role. For example, the purpose of subsection 2 (
	<i>b</i>) is that a person may be detained for some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
reason and the policemen doing that must find out from the Procurator-Fiscal whether they should continue to detain him and to gather evidence so as to instigate criminal proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest for a moment that there should be the slightest alteration of the present balance of powers between the police and the Procurator-Fiscal. I believe that it is a balance of which we should be extremely proud and from which immense benefits flow. Those south of the border envy it, even though they have now allowed such a wide river of history to run between us that they cannot swim across to our side.

To put matters in ordinary language, let us suppose that there is a fight in the street and the police arrest someone. They take statements from witnesses; they charge that person, and there may or may not be a reply after caution. A police report then goes to the Procurator-Fiscal. That is what usually happens. The instigating of criminal proceedings against someone is entirely a decision for the Procurator-Fiscal. One reason for someone's being detained is to decide whether criminal proceedings should be instigated against him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many circumstances in which the police say to a Procurator-Fiscal "We have found someone doing the following. Do you wish us to carry out our investigation into the offence with a view to your instigating proceedings against him?" As one of the purposes for which a person may be detained is that the Procurator-Fiscal may be contacted, we believe that it would be fairer for that to be spelt out in the Bill as a reason for his detention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Probing amendments have their value. The Opposition Front Bench has started a hare running which I believe we should pursue a little way, because there may be more in the matter than meets the eye.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understood the Solicitor-General to suggest that there was a possibility of investigation under the powers of clause 2 at a delayed time lag, so to speak. I hope that the Committee follows me. Clearly, clause 2 will normally come into play when a police officer comes across an incident in which he feels that an offence has been committed. In those circumstances any action that he might want to take concerning detention will be taken at once
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
and will be covered by the carrying out of an investigation of the offence. That circumstance is already covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only situation that the Solicitor-General has suggested is that which obtains after the report has gone to the Procurator-Fiscal—that is, after the initial investigation has been completed, and presumably after the police are satisfied that they have enough facts to allow them to submit a report, including a prima facie case, to the Fiscal. As I understand it, the Solicitor-General told us that at that point the Fiscal may say, as he quite often does, that he would like further investigations carried out into some aspect of the case. I would not suggest for one moment that the Fiscal is not entitled to do that. However, I am not sure that the powers in clause 2 constitute an appropriate way in which to carry out that further investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the 6-hour detention provision has any merit—of course, we have fundamental doubts about that—it is as an immediate aid, to allow immediate investigations on the discovery of an offence or suspected offence. I am not happy about the idea that after papers have gone to the Fiscal and after the Fiscal has considered them a fiat should go out for further investigation, the form of which will be a constable saying to someone, "You may remember that we interviewed you two weeks ago last Thursday and that you were subsequently cautioned and charged. We now want to make further investigations into the circumstances of that offence, and we are going to take you to the police station under clause 2."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be other ways in which that could be achieved under the general powers of arrest—by a warrant from the Fiscal, for example, or by some other means. I do not know. We could construct all sorts of models. However, I am unhappy about the powers in clause 2 being used in that way, which is what the Solicitor-General seemed to be suggesting. I do not think that there is any need for the phrase at all. Perhaps I am building up fears based upon what has just been said. Clearly I have not had time to consider the text. It may be that my fears are groundless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if that is so I am driven back to the conclusion that the words are almost certainly redundant. The wording should be simply:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of facilitating the carrying out of investigations into the offence"—</p></blockquote>
or perhaps "into that offence", referring
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>207</span>
back to the offence that is reasonably suspected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is something in what the Solicitor-General seems to be hinting, I do not like it. If my fears are groundless, we do not need those words. Either way we need further clarification. The Solicitor-General's opening point was that it was simply a matter of explaining to the person concerned what his position was. But that does not enter into it. There is no suggestion that the qualifying phrases in paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>) and (
	<i>b</i>) will be explained in any way to the suspected party. On the whole it would be better if, in order to remove doubt, we excised them from the Bill altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Solicitor-General when he says that the present balance between the police and the Fiscal service works well on the whole. I hope that the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure in England will take a leaf out of the Scottish book. We would make common cause on that issue, as we would on a number of other possible reforms, such as the abolition of committal proceedings in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not necessarily take the conspiracy view; I would not like to think that there is any attempt, in retaining that form of words, to alter that balance. However, as a minor caveat I would add that there may be misinterpretation. We sometimes hear statements from policemen or commentators to the effect that the police are extremely frustrated and would like to have more say in prosecution policy— that they deliver the goods and nothing happens. That is nothing to do with the argument, but it could be dragged into it. That is a minor example of the dangers of retaining what—despite the somewhat inexact and ill-defined hints of the Solicitor-General—I suspect is probably essentially redundant rather than a wicked addition to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Solicitor-General insists that it actually means something, we shall want to know a great deal more about what that is. But if he retreats from the proposition, I suggest that we bury it decently, quietly, and quickly, and get on with more important matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the wisest course for the Solicitor-General to take at this stage would be to give an undertaking to the Committee to look at this matter again on Report. Quite
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
frankly, the Solicitor-General's explanation worried me gravely. I do not think that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) is importing any fears and doubts into the Bill. The Committee must appreciate that we are talking here of a total procedure to be carried out. If the Government's subsequent amendments, which we are soon to come to, are carried, a total procedure during the period of detention will be carried out in a police station in something like 5½ hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised that the Solicitor-General said that this provision has been inserted in the Bill in order that once the police have completed or gone part way through an investigation they then contact the Procurator-Fiscal to see if they should continue. As I understand the position, if someone is arrested—we are not talking about detention—the police are under an obligation to get that person into court at the first available sitting. Normally, that is the next morning, but if the weekend intervenes it would usually be Monday morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in this case we are talking of someone who has not been arrested but who is under suspicion. He has been detained under clause 2, and there is the investigation into whether this person should be arrested. For the life of me, I do not see where the Procurator-Fiscal comes into this stage at all. We are talking about the stage before arrest—about someone who is under suspicion. The Solicitor-General is saying that the police will convey their suspicion, as I understand his words, to the Procurator-Fiscal, and the Procurator-Fiscal will either confirm or deny that suspicion and will or will not tell the police to continue with their investigations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that the strong possibility is that unless there are exceptional circumstances a suspected person will be at the police station under clause 2 for the maximum time contained in the Bill. I honestly do not believe in my heart of hearts that police will take people to the police station unless they have very good reasons for taking them. I also believe that their good reasons will lead them to the position where they will detain them for questioning for the maximum period allowable under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the life of me I do not see the situation that the Solicitor-General is painting where in the middle of an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>209</span>
investigation, when a person has been neither arrested nor charged, the police should contact the Procurator-Fiscal and ask whether the criminal proceedings should be instigated against that person. It seems a dangerous thing to write into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know, as my hon. Friend says, that in some cases people are arrested. They are held in custody overnight and in the morning the Procurator-Fiscal decides that they should not appear in court. He decides that he will not proceed with the case. I can think of one case— which I shall not name because it has not come to trial—where four people were arrested on a very serious offence and only three of them appeared in court the following morning. On the instructions of the Procurator-Fiscal—I suspect not at the desire of the police—the fourth person was released. He did not appear in court at all, but that is a different matter. We are talking here about a situation where someone is suspected of an offence, is detained under clause 2, and is neither arrested nor charged. It seems to me that these are dangerous words to write into the statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may well be that a different form of words—something like "as to whether the matter should be reported to the Procurator-Fiscal" would suffice in this case. A different form might meet the point, and we need time to think about it. But I do not believe we can accept that these words remain in the Bill, because they are ambiguous and people will read this legislation in years to come. There is no doubt that these words will be interpreted as giving the police the right to decide whether criminal proceedings are instigated against such a person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want the hon. Member, or any other member of the Committee, to be confused. The Procurator-Fiscal does not caution and charge someone.

proceedings begin when someone is cautioned and charged. Above all, the Solicitor-General does not need me to tell him that criminal proceedings are instigated by the Procurator-Fiscal, not by the police, and we ought not to depart from that principle in any shape or form. I hope that the Solicitor-General will see the wisdom of this and that he will be generous and accept that there is a requirement for a second look at this matter on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I enter this arcane area with a great deal of trepidation. I do not understand these mysteries, but my antennae are flickering fiercely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 6 introduces a major change in our judicial criminal procedure. The whole run of the Bill ties together the questions of name and address, suspect, detention, search powers and so on, and now we have this new form of judicial procedure. We have had a certain pride in the role of the Procurator-Fiscal in Scotland and his separation from the police. I have argued the case so often that I am sick of arguing it. Now it seems that there is a danger of this being called into question not so much by the words here as by the explanation we have produced for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Solicitor-General saying that he envisages a closer co-operation between the police and the Procurator-Fiscal, in the course of which the process of handling an investigation will be altered? Is he saying that someone can be under suspicion for a period of time but that no arrest or charge is made, that no paper is put to the Procurator-Fiscal but that some kind of consultation takes place and the Procurator-Fiscal says "Have 'em in. Use clause 2 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill. Have 'em in under detention and see what you can get out of 'em."? Is this what the Solicitor-General is suggesting? If so, that is very serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What else is the reason for this? We had thought that this was to be a quick operation of detention replacing arrest when it was thought that a crime had been committed or was in the process of being committed. Now we see it as a matter of detention in the middle of an investigation already involving the Procurator-Fiscal. This is changing the concept of the operation of our law with a vengeance. Have I got it completely wrong? If I am standing on my head, I will come on to my feet if told, and I should like the Solicitor-General to clarify the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) to suffer from vertigo. I think that the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing), although not so much the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar), is reading false fears into this. If a person is detained on suspicion for the purpose of carrying out investigations into the offence—and that is all that the provision says—that person cannot be taken to the police station with any other aim in view. In other words, investigations must proceed. But under paragraph (
	<i>b</i>), a policeman may arrest a person whom he suspects is under the influence of a drug, for instance,—someone who is behaving strangely—take him to the police station and ask his senior officer "Should we charge him?" The senior officer says "We had better have a medical examination", which then is neutral. So the officer says "Well he is behaving in a very strange way and appears to be under the influence of a drug. We have no evidence at present and we cannot obtain it in six hours without chemical analysis showing whether he is or is not under the influence of a drug." That is not directed to an inquiry into the offence; it is an inquiry into whether criminal proceedings should be instigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take another example in which a person is detained and the evidence is solely of his fingerprints on a stolen object. Of itself, that evidence is not sufficient. Does one instigate criminal proceedings by charging him, or does one release him without charge? It is not a question of further investigation into the offence because no further investigation can be made; it is a question of deciding whether to instigate criminal proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth does not think that criminal proceedings start when a person is charged, let me inform him that the hon. Member for Garscadden will start to charge him for his services from the moment that he is charged. Most people regard criminal proceedings as having been instigated when they are charged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to raise any hares or flutter any pigeons. However, when carrying out investigations into an offence, the alternatives include releasing the person, deciding not to proceed with the matter, and whether to charge him if there is strong uncorroborated evidence—all these
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
matters are covered by the provisions of paragraph (

The common sense position on this matter would be to remove these words from this measure before they get any future Solicitor-General or anyone else into trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am most interested in the new definition of when criminal proceedings begin. According to the Solicitor-General, criminal proceedings begin when one receives one's first account from one's lawyer. I can be persuaded on that, but I cannot be persuaded that these words should remain in the Bill. I strongly advise all my hon. Friends, the right hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take this opportunity to refer briefly to the four amendments in the group which are in my name: Nos. 28, 29, 30 and 31. I am pleased to see that amendment No. 34 in the name of the Solicitor-General for Scotland and his hon. Friend is virtually the same wording as my amendment No. 28. I take it that that implies that they are in some agreement with the point that I have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be rather vague to leave the clause as it was and to
	<br><blockquote><p>"take that person to a police station or other premises and … that person may be detained there."</p></blockquote>
That could be open to abuse as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a suspect were picked up on Sauchie-hall Street—I heard someone else refer to Glasgow; it must be the example for the Bill—certain policemen might take the opportunity of driving the detainee to the police station on the bonny banks of Loch Lomond. When he is in the police car, certain things could happen; the police could ignore his existence totally. They could be discussing a football match or anything else of general interest, or they could start the interrogation. They could start the softening-up process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not necessarily implying anything of a third-degree nature, but the pressure on the detainee would start from the time he was picked up. As a specific period of six hours has been laid down in the Bill, the actual beginning of this period should be clarified in the interests of making more precise law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society made the point very well in its submission. I do not take any of these documents as gospel. The Law Society freely admits that its members do not have unanimity within their own organisation. However, they are people of experience of this type of procedure. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With regard to the commencement of detention, the Council considers that the clause should state when detention starts, and that this should be at the moment of the requirement being made at the locus and should be recorded by the constable. The Council is concerned about the possible delay

in taking the suspect to the place of detention, which could considerably prolong the maximum period if the Council's suggestion is not adopted."</p></blockquote>
I am glad that the Government have agreed that there is something in that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to amendment No. 29. Nothing in the Bill makes clear at what time the detention begins. It is implied that when somebody is expressly detained. That leaves this unsatisfactory grey area that the Government appeared to be ignoring. Someone assisting the police could be a long time answering questions unaware that they were free to leave when they have been detained for six hours or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Glasgow Bar Association says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many of the safeguards available to an arrested person, i.e. one on whom suspicion is focused to the extent that the police feel confident enough to prefer a charge, are not available to the detainee…"</p></blockquote>
It is very unsatisfactory, to put it mildly, that a person who is merely detained, an innocent person, has not even the right of an arrested person. That should be straightened out by the adoption of amendment No. 29.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 30 in my name is consequential on subsection (2), to which I have just referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 31 relates to clause 3 and ensures that a record be kept of any request made by the detainee to a solicitor and another person. At the moment he has no right to be told of his right to make such intimation. My main thoughts in tabling these amendments is that they would be useful in the interests of both clarity and justice and of the assumptions that an administrative person should be able to make under the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may assist the Committee and abbreviate the debate if I now speak to Government amendments, Nos. 34 to 41. I am indebted to the right hon. Member most of whose amendments, No. 31 excepted, are to the same effect. He raised that matter on Second Reading, if I recall correctly, and it is a question as to when the detention should begin. On the one hand, it might be said that the person at the top of Loch Lomond will have a longer period of detention in a police car if he is being taken to Glasgow than a person who is arrested at Govan Cross.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
I emphasise that it is the intention of the Government that a person should be taken as quickly as possible to the police station or other place where he is to be detained. Detention begins from the moment of a person's detention and not— perhaps the Bill was ambiguous about this—from the moment of his arrival at the place in which he is to be detained. I want there to be no doubt about that. The detention period of six hours begins from the moment the constable says, wherever he may be "I am detaining you". It is then the duty of the constable, in the terms of our amendment, to take him as quickly as possible to the place where the powers in the section are to be exercised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Solicitor-General has been extremely helpful in introducing the Government amendments and in giving the Committee the reasoning behind them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could he help me on one matter? I have looked at amendments Nos. 40 and 41 and see as regards amendment No. 40, that in page 3, line 20, the words "place of detention" are being taken out and the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the place where detention begins and the police station or other premises to which the person is taken".</p></blockquote>
inserted. In amendment No. 41, after "time", insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"when detention under subsection (1) above
begins".</p></blockquote>
Implied in that is what the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) is saying, but nowhere is it spelled out where detention begins, as far as I can see. Is he satisfied that there is no need to spell it out? Does he think it sufficient to leave us to infer from amendment No. 40 that it is, as he says, at the point where the requirement is first made. That is not said specifically anywhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member raises an important point. Under amendment No. 35 a person may be detained and the detention may continue, so it is clear that we start:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a constable has reasonable grounds … may for the purpose of … carrying out of investigations"</p></blockquote>
detain that person, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is clear that where the constable first finds him is the place of detention. Thereafter the detention may continue and he must take him as quickly as is reasonably possible to a police station or other premises, subject to the following
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
provisions, and it says that detention may continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have examined the amendments which seem to make it watertight when detention begins, and then, of course, as consequential amendments, one has to record the time when detention begins as well as the place to which one is taken and the time of arrival and so on. It is our intention that a person should be taken as quickly as reasonably practicable to a police station or the place in which the powers are to be used. It is desirable that the powers should be used in those circumstances and not in what might be called less formal circumstances. The Secretary of State will issue guidelines to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But inevitably, where a person is detained and transported in a vehicle, conversation will arise. One cannot say "Will you shut up and stop trying to tell me about this matter because we have not yet reached the police station?" It is the Government's intention that detention begins wherever the person is at the time and that he is conveyed as quickly as possible to the place in which the powers are to be used. But, in the interim period, we cannot prevent his talking. Therefore, it would be nonsense to suggest that the officer should say "I am terribly sorry, but I am not allowed to discuss even the Celtic-Rangers match, because we have not reached the place at which detention will begin."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be self-evident, but there is another possible situation. A person may go to a police station on a purely voluntary basis and then say that he wants to leave. Presumably the six hours could run from that moment. Is that what is in the Minister's mind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General for Scotland</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In those circumstances, detention would not have operated up to that point. If it then began, it would be from that point. I was describing to the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) views similar to his own, but rather different loyalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendments will be tabled before we next meet to cover the points made in amendment No. 31, but they are the same points as those covered by amendments Nos. 88 to 92 which come under clause 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Solicitor-General for Scotland, who on this occasion has been helpful in explaining the purpose behind the Government's amendments. We were anxious to define clearly the point at which the period of detention began. Our fears were heightened—I say this even in the absence of the Under-Secretary of State—by an interview given by the Under-Secretary to 
	<i>The Scotsman.</i> He was asked when he thought that the period of detention should begin, and he said that it should be from the moment that someone wanted to go home. As I have said, that is a philosophy which Government Whips would be very interested in exercising. I suspect that all Conservative Members would be under detention if that principle were imported into the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful, therefore, for the explanation that detention will begin from the moment that it is decided to take a person into detention. The six-hour period—we shall argue for a four-hour period in a minute—should begin whether it is in the person's home, on the street or wherever, when it is decided to take him into detention. We are grateful to the Solicitor-General for making clear the Government's position and also for agreeing that further amendments are needed against the background of the amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart). I wish to make a further comment on what was said by the Solicitor-General. We are also interested in the fact that the Secretary of State is to issue guidance on this matter because the guidance itself will be very important. If it is possible—and I do not see why it should not be—I hope that copies of that guidance, which will obviously not be issued until the Bill has reached the statute book, are made available in the Library so that Members of Parliament can see what sort of guidance has been issued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The one part of what was said by the Solicitor-General that worried me a little was his comment about the guidelines. I would have hoped that those guidelines would have been open to some parliamentary scrutiny, perhaps being laid by the Secretary of State in an order so that Parliament could scrutinise them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should advise my hon. Friend that it has been a golden rule
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
of Parliament that we never interfere with a chief constable in the discharge of his duties or the deployment of his police force. Indeed, we have argued this matter before. No Government have a right to tell a chief constable what he should or should not do. One of the cardinal concepts of the relationship between Governments and the police is that a chief constable has this almost total discretion. As I understand what the Solicitor-General said, it is that the guidance that is to be issued to chief constables—because that is obviously where the guidance will go—will indicate when the period of detention is to begin. For my part, I should like to see that guidance just to satisfy myself on what had been said to the chief constables in case there are future occasions when I have to approach a chief constable on a constituency case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves that issue I am in total agreement with what he said about guidelines and chief constables. There are several matters that we should consider. First, we should at least see the guidelines given to the chief constables. Secondly, is it not the case with this Bill, with other Bills and with statements made by many Ministers over the last year that the question of democratic control over the behaviour of the police is now one that is very much on the agenda? It may be that before the passing of the Bill we may want to have something to say about the democratic control over the guidelines. If anything the whole position under this Government has changed considerably and perhaps under the guise of democracy they should be stopped and democracy itself established.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to enter the area of the question of democratic control over chief constables. I shall content myself with saying to my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) that I believe that one of the biggest errors that we made—and I use the word "we" collectively to describe those who were here at the time—was in the reorganisation of the police forces in Scotland. I openly admit that I did not think that that was the case at the time, and although I was not responsible, if it were to be done all over again I would argue strongly for retaining a fairly large
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
number of separate police forces rather than for a small number of large police forces. I believe that a great mistake was made, but we all know that it is easy to be wise after an event. I accept that there is a debate developing about democratic accountability and none of us can run away from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the amendments tabled in my name and those of my hon. Friends. I deal first with the amendment that seeks to reduce the period of detention from six hours to four hours. Let me make clear that when Thomson was considering this proposition, the matter of six hours' detention was not laid before the Thomson Committee. No one gave evidence to Thomson in favour of a six-hour detention period. The Thomson Committee had two propositions before it, first, for a 24-hour detention period, secondly, for a 12-hour detention period. It was on both those counts that evidence was given. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker), who has tabled an amendment, will speak to it for himself, but I tell him now that I suspect that the majority of the Committee is against an extension from six to 12 hours. However, we shall come to that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All Thomson says is that, having considered the 24-hour proposition and the 12-hour proposition, he has come down in favour of six hours, but he does not say why he does do. As I said at the time, I strongly suspect that it was basically a question of balance. Therefore, what the Committee must decide is whether six hours or four hours is the correct balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Opposition's view, our Bill had it right. Four hours was sufficient to allow the police to carry out the procedures required under clause 2. When the matter was debated under the Labour Government's Bill, the proposition to increase the period from four to six hours was soundly defeated. I am surprised that the six hours has found its way back into this Bill, for I thought at that time that, following the debate and the vote, we had decided that four hours was a reasonable period. From our point of view, four hours is perfectly adequate to carry out the kind of examination and investigation that the police will be required to carry out under clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that some of my hon. Friends would like to see the detention period abolished altogether. I do not want, in what I say, to compromise any of my hon. Friends. These propositions are, for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V012P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
them, fallback positions but, having supported a principle in the previous Bill, I again stand by what I said when that Bill was debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to another series of amendments in the names of my hon. Friend and myself. They seek to change the reference from "detention" to "temporary arrest". They are probing to find out the thinking of the Solicitor-General and the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have thought closely about the matter since we last debated it, and have heard—-I say this in his absence—the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) on Second Reading, who seemed to me to be attracted to the phrase "temporary arrest". I have come, not to the conclusion but to the position, where I feel that we ought at least to debate the possibility of substituting those words. It has the attraction that an arrested person has certain rights, and equally a person under temporary arrest has certain rights. It would, in my view, remove a fairly broad area of doubt and controversy if the wording were changed from "detention" to "temporary arrest".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made a long and detailed study of Thomson. When I was dealing with the Bill, the second Thomson Committee report was the second thing that I grabbed when I went home every Thursday night or Friday morning, so I have been through Thomson time and time again, and I know that Thomson made a reference to temporary arrest but seemed to reject it on the basis of an American experience. But American experiences are not always the best on which to accept or reject anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the phrase "temporary arrest" has certain advantages that should at least be discussed. The Solicitor-General has answered other amendments about when the period of detention should begin. This will obviously require tidying up and I think that the Solicitor-General accepts that. Indeed, he implied it in his comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, the position at this stage is that we are suggesting to the Committee that the six-hour period ought to be reduced to four hours on the basis that that is sufficient. We have argued the case and there was no evidence in favour of six hours submitted to Thomson, so I hope that no one will quote Thomson on this. Thomson's view on six hours was that it was the proper balance—no more and no less. We are entitled to our view that four
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
hours is the proper balance—no more and no less. Thomson rejected the 24- and 12-hour suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point that I want to make concerns the possibility that the Government will accept that changing the term "detention" to "temporary arrest" would have certain obvious advantages. It could clear up this fairly vast area of doubt that will remain if we continue to use the phrase "detention". I look forward to hearing the Solicitor-General's comment on whether we should use the phrase "temporary arrest".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>7.0 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. It has just been drawn to my attention by the hon. Members for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Hogg) that what some of us regard as an extremely crucial amendment, related to the question being discussed—temporary arrest—has not been selected. It changes the concept of detention to arrest by ensuring that if we were not to have the legal safeguard of redress that could come from arrest, there would have to be established an independent police board to secure, without the legal definition of arrest, that sort of redress by having an independent presence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am extremely disturbed to see that the amendment is not listed. Since we are perhaps coming close to the end of the sitting, I thought that I should raise it now, so that I could ask you, Mr. Gourlay, to look again at those amendments and ensure that they are included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there might be an opportunity to give some thought between now and the next sitting as to how we should debate the part of the Bill that we are now on. There has been a lot of confusion in jumping from point to point. I do not think we should participate in such a disjointed argument as might follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
