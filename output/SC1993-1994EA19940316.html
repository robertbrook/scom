	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>Court of Auditors
<br><br><!-- lb --> Report on the Environment</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Tony Baldry)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a short statement about the European Court of Auditors' report, which was prepared in response to a resolution by the European Parliament relating to discharge of the 1988 Community budget. The report represents the outcome of audits of the Commission and six member states: Germany, Greece, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. It covers the objectives and resources of Community environmental measures, the management of appropriations for this area, the relationship between structural instruments such as structural funds and the environment, and the implementation of environmental directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the explanatory memorandum—sent to the Committee in October 1992—makes clear, the resport was published in September 1992, so much of it is now a matter of history. The report was not debated by the Committee earlier because there were other, more pressing, matters that it wished to discuss. Much of the report has already been acted upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the criticism in the Court of Auditors' report is directed at the Commission's handling of environmental policy, and it highlights concerns about serious lack of co-ordination, poorly defined objectives and poor project control. The report also expresses concern about the slow progress in the implementation of environmental directives and doubt about whether those, on their own, can induce a significant change in environmental behaviour. There is some specific criticism of member states, but there is practically none of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report raised some important issues about the way the Commission and member states seek to manage the Community's environment. We have long been concerned by the apparent lack of overall co-ordination on environmental matters in the Commission. In many Community-funded projects, it appeared that one part of the Commission did not know what another part was doing. General thinking has been to compartmentalise the environment, without realising that environmental concerns impinge on many other areas of Community policy, sometimes involving direct conflicts which need to be resolved at an early stage of policy formulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the audits that gave rise to the report, many of those issues have been addressed. Lack of co-ordination is still a major issue sometimes, but I am glad to say that developments in the past two or three years have gone a long way to meet the report's recommenda-
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
tions. There is increasing recognition by the Community as a whole of the need to consider the environmental impact of all policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the new emphasis on the environment that came about in the Maastricht treaty, which stresses the need to promote sustainable development and integrate the needs of environmental protection into other Community policies. The Commission has also made an attempt to get to grips with the problems outlined in the fifth environmental action programme called "Towards Sustainability", the Community strategy document for the environment from 1993 to 2000. That programme promotes the themes of sustainable development and integration with other key policy areas and stresses that we all have our part to play in protecting the environment, whether as national or local government, industry or individuals. Many of the programme's objectives and targets present significant challenges for us and others to meet, but the fifth action programme represents an important step forward. It sets out an overall Community strategy, takes full account of the way in which the environment impinges on other areas and proposes objectives and targets and suggesting responsibilities for action. The programme also recognises that legislation alone may not be enough and that additional measures, such as market-based instruments, may be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has adopted new internal procedures to identify and justify proposals with significant environmental consequences and designated a senior official in each of the directorates-general to oversee progress and implementation. The Commission will report on progress in its annual report and has adopted a code of green housekeeping. We welcome those developments in integration, as it is a theme that we have consistently promoted. For example, during our presidency, we made it a major theme of our informal Environment Council and promoted debate on it at a number of other Councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Court of Auditors' report expressed doubt about EC directives' effectiveness in tackling problems alone, which touches on what evaluation there is of Community environmental policy. A continuous flow of legislation emerges from Brussels, but to date there has been no effective mechanism to review the impact of such legislation on the world. We must encourage the Commission to concentrate attention on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom fully supports measures that will enable the Commission and the Community to do a better job of enforcement because we want European Community law to be applied consistently across the Community and all member states to take their obligations seriously. A number of recent developments should help. A network of environmental enforcement agencies has been set up—Her Majesty's inspectorate of pollution in the United Kingdom and its equivalents in other states—to exchange practical experiences and develop common approaches to implementation. The Commission has undertaken to produce a report annually on implementation and enforcement that is to be discussed by the Council of Ministers. We now, at last, have a European environmental agency, which will collect and analyse environmental statistics. That should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
help the Commission to take better-informed decisions on environmental policy, which can only be to everyone's benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report that we are discussing today is something of an historical document, because time has moved on. It is valuable none the less. The Commission and the Community have made considerable progress since its publication, but I am happy to try to answer any of the Committee's questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I hope that you can help all members of the Committee. How can we lodge the strongest protest with the Government's business managers about the timing of these proceedings? It will not have escaped your attention, Mr. Hogg, that we are considering accounts going back to 1988, the report of the Court of Auditors dated September 1992 and, more significant, the report of the Select Committee on European Legislation—of which I am a member—on proceedings that took place as long ago as 18 November 1992, when that Committee said that this Committee should consider these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am baffled by the Minister's explanation of why the matter took so long to come to the Committee. Surely it is a complete mockery of the concept of parliamentary scrutiny if the Committee is asked to consider a matter that the Select Committee on European Legislation suggested should be referred to us 16 months ago. That really is not good enough and I ask whether, through your good offices, Mr. Hogg, and that of the Chairman's Panel, the strongest protest can be lodged with the Government, because they order the proceedings of this Committee—we can do nothing until they refer matters to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. It is clear that we are talking not about vast amounts of taxpayers' money. It is not good enough for the Minister to come here and say that he assumed that the Committee had another sense of priorities. The Committee does not set the agenda. It is frightening that a matter of such importance should be being dealt with as cursorily and superficially as the Committee appears to be being treated by the business managers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the House of Commons sets up to two European Standing Committees to scrutinise European legislation because it believes that its procedure is wanting and follows that up by making sure that those Committees have an agenda that covers the work of the Commission and the EC, it is extremely insulting for the business managers to take such a long time to refer relevant pieces of legislation to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, the time that has elapsed since the Select Committee on European Legislation said that we should consider this matter is not a matter for me. The hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris) understands that. I am not quite sure how best to proceed. I am not without sympathy for the point that has been made by the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Lady, but it is not within my power to do anything about it. I am merely asked to chair the Committee. Hon. Members should raise those matters through the usual
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
channels, although there is no Whip present. The Minister may be able to make some helpful comments, but no point of order arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. I shall gladly report by hon. Friend's concerns to the business managers, and they will be noted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On another point of order, Mr. Hogg. I suggest that the Committee adjourn until we know why we have been treated in such an unacceptable and cavalier manner. We are talking about millions of pounds, but the Government's attitude is that the House of Commons has no right to scrutinise the report until it is 16 months out of date. Then the Minister says that the report is a matter of history.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what the hon. Lady has said. The hon. Lady is concerned about the time that it has taken for this matter to be brought before the Committee, but there would be a further delay if we were to adjourn. If the hon. Lady moves the Adjournment motion, I shall feel obliged to accept it. However, it might be better to dispose of the matter rather than delay consideration of it even further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Hogg. I agree with you. I do not blame my hon. Friend the Minister for this, but I hope that he will relay to the business managers that I am not prepared to go through this nonsense again. If the Government delay bringing other matters before the Committee, I shall back any move to adjourn and shall not take further part in its proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to make matters clear, I beg to move, That further consideration be now adjourned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the motion debatable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Committee proceeds, I wish to put it on record that, as far as Ministers are concerned—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I take it that the hon. Lady wishes to speak to the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Hogg, I shall do that briefly. The Committee should adjourn so that we can receive an adequate explanation of the timetable. Ministers should not assume that they can treat European Standing Committees with cavalier disregard, as has happened this morning. It is not in the interests of hon. Members that they allow a matter to proceed in such a way, as if we were talking about a veterinary order affecting rabbits. We are talking about something that affects vast amounts of taxpayers' money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to put it on record that no Minister treats the Committee in a cavalier way. All Ministers are servants of the House and take considerable care to prepare themselves for these Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
When ordering the business that is to come before the Committee, business managers clearly give priority to legislative items for when the Council of Ministers has set a deadline. I think that the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) and other members of the Committee would be justifiably offended if they were invited to consider a report after it had passed its legislative deadline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission indicated that there was no deadline for considering the Court of Auditors' report. Indeed, the report has never been considered by the Commission in Brussels. It is being debated now only because there have been higher priority debates for the Committee. The hon. Lady and the Committee should bear it in mind that there are a finite number of opportunities for the Committee to consider matters and that those who draw up the business for the Committee wish to bring forward those matters in respect of which there is a deadline. That was not the case in this instance and it is why the report is before the Committee today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for me, I am prepared to help the Committee today, but if the Committee adjourns I shall be happy to come back on a subsequent occasion to help it then. It does not matter to me. My officials and I always stand ready to assist the Committee. I spend most of my time trying to assist hon. Members—I think that I probably reply to more Adjournment debates than any other Minister. If the Committee wants to adjourn, that is a matter for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall certainly draw the concerns that have been raised today to the attention of business managers. I should have thought that it would be sensible for regular members of the Committee to discuss this matter with the business managers so that concerns of this kind are not raised again in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a permanent member of the Committee, so I do not have a vote in it, but I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich has raised a strong and important point about the rights of Members of Parliament and of the Committee. As the Labour party spokesman here, if I had a vote I would cast it with my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, I do not blame my hon. Friend the Minister in any way for the predicament that he is in. He has nothing to do with the ordering of our business. We all know how it is done—through the usual channels, when they exist. Obviously they do not exist at the moment—that may be a clue to explaining the difficulty that we are in, but I doubt it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite what my hon. Friend the Minister said, there has been a period of several weeks during which the Committee has not met, to the surprise, I think, of many hon. Members. We wondered what had happened to European Standing Committee A. With great respect to my hon. Friend, his argument does not wash. We have not been overworked in recent weeks or months, so there must be another reason for the delay. I do not know what it is, but I shall make it my business to find out. I shall certainly tackle the authorities on my side of the House and I hope that Opposition Members will tackle the authorities on theirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
The delay is not good enough. It makes a mockery of scrutiny. However, the Committee has been summoned, and your point, Mr. Hogg, is valid. If we complain about the length of time that has passed before the Committee has been asked to consider the report and put it off, there will further delay. That is a factor to bear in mind when considering the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter that I think the Committee must consider is the inconvenience that would be caused by delay. We should not be too concerned about inconveniencing the Minister because he is a splendid fellow who is paid to take the flak and turn up when he is summoned. That is what he has signed up to. We should not feel sorry for ourselves as Members of Parliament, nor should we feel sorry for the Minister. That is the rough and tumble of the game.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, we should consider that many of us have busy schedules. Today alone, I shall be attending four committees. The last thing that I want to do is to return for another sitting of European Standing Committee A when we can dispose of the matter here and now. In that, perhaps selfish, light, I shall, on balance, resist the motion, but I do not think that the matter should be allowed to pass lightly. I am delighted that the hon. Lady has forced the issue. With some reluctance I shall vote against the motion and urge my hon. Friends to do likewise, but I shall make it my business to register the strongest protest with the Whips and business managers, telling them that if it happens again I shall not hesitate to support the hon. Lady or any other Opposition Member who moves such a motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great sympathy with the motion of the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich. I agree with her entirely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also agree with my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives because the Minister and his officials are here and hon. Members have given up their time to sit on the Committee today. If we agree to the motion, we shall delay scrutiny of the documents, waste time and money by having to reconvene the Committee and risk delaying scrutiny of other matters. As other hon. Members have said, we have not met for several weeks and one feels that there may be a blockage in the pipeline. The Committee may have to sit every week until the summer adjournment. If we had to reschedule consideration of the report we should face the danger of missing the boat on timely scrutiny of something else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sat on the Committee for a relatively short period, but on no fewer that two occasions the papers for a Wednesday meeting have failed to arrive in time for us to scrutinise them sufficiently to take part in debate on them. I add my voice in the strongest possible terms to protests to those who are responsible for arranging the Committee's business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share completely the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich and my hon. Friends the Members for St. Ives and for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan). My hon. Friend the Minister has done a manful job of trying to defend the indefensible. Frankly, if the institutions of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
the European Community have failed to consider this damning report in the months that have elapsed since it was published, that adds to the public scandal that surrounds the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On balance, we ought probably to continue the Committee's proceedings for the reasons given by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives. If you, Mr. Hogg, were willing to consider a manuscript amendment to the motion, that might provide a way to register the Committee's disapproval of the way in which procedures have been abused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. The usual procedure is to start with an hour of questions before moving on to the debate. But, because of the discussions about adjourning and the earlier statement, we have lost about 25 minutes.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend will bear with me, she will understand why I offer my sympathy to the Minister. In the past few years, I have sat on several Committees on which the Minister has led for the Government. He seems to have a unique capacity—almost independent of himself—to get into difficulties in Committee, for reasons completely beyond his control. I recall his manful efforts to explain, with the aid of various graphs and so on, the leasehold legislation. They stand as a landmark for the obscure in parliamentary history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first question may help to explain why there was such a delay with the documents. Much as the Minister has supported the overall conclusions and findings of the report, have not the Government been somewhat
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
tardy in implementing some environmental directives? The most notable is the bathing water directive, which they have sought to weaken, in addition to other fairly popular directives from the European Union, such as the drinking water directive the nitrogen dioxide directive and the wild birds directive. Although the Government welcome the report, has not their own task force recommended, on environmental assessment, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The European Union directive on environmental assessment should be reconsidered and further proposals vigorously resisted?"</p></blockquote>
That seems to show a reluctance to comply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is not it also true that, in environmental protection, the Government are set on a path towards deregulation? However, the European Union has taken a much more vigorous view on implementation that would require co-ordination, to which direct reference has been made in some paragraphs of the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, is not it high time—the report refers to this—that, through the Commission, the Government and their counterparts in other member states examined more vigorously the whole sphere of environmental impact assessment? It is an issue that the European Union has, rightly, pushed hard for a number of years. Yet we seem no further on as we wait for the paving legislation for the environmental agency to determine what is meant by environmental assessment and the indicators that should be used to implement such a programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is time that the Government got their act in order. The document rightly criticises the lack of coordination in the Commission, and the same criticism could be made of this Government. Responsibilities for the environment are spread between different Departments. There is clear evidence in a number of areas that the Government do not have the necessary level of co-ordination, especially in relation to environmental impact assessment and the road programme, to convince anyone that they are taking environmental considerations seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measures are long overdue, but the Government's reaction has been too slow. That slowness reflects their uncertainty about how to proceed. So although we welcome the late arrival of the document, a number of concerns still remain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much of the hon. Gentleman's speech contained common and repeated canards which do not bear scrutiny beside the facts. We have been meticulous in our determination to implement European Community directives into domestic law. Indeed, of the 110 environmental directives, 102 are incorporated into United Kingdom domestic law. I believe that our record is better than that of any other Community member state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so far as we have had occasional difficulties in implementing directives into our domestic law, that is sometimes because of the separate legislative arrangements that pertain to Northern Ireland. That means that there can be a delay in incorporating directives that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
cover the whole of the United Kingdom. I believe that our determination to incorporate environmental directives stands comparison with that of any other member state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Likewise, only one out of 47 European Court of Justice judgments on environmental matters in a period to 1992 was against the United Kingdom. By comparison, there were 12 judgments against Italy, 11 against Belgium, eight against Germany and five against France. This country has an impressive record in incorporating European directives into our domestic legislation and ensuring that such measures are carried through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the process. Again, I believe that the process by which we take environmental policy forward is a model for other member states and the rest of the world. There is considerable integration throughout Whitehall to ensure that we have integrated and coherent environmental policies. The Committee will remember the publication several years ago of the White Paper, "This Common Inheritance", which set an agenda for action. As a consequence of that White Paper, two committees were set up in Whitehall. One was chaired by the Prime Minister, and one by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsequent years, as part of the process, we published a report on "This Common Inheritance" which clearly set out what has been achieved and a timetable for subsequent action. Anyone looking at the report will know exactly what was achieved during the year and what it was intended to achieve in subsequent years. That is a rolling programme. It is not simply a tick list of what is set out in "This Common Inheritance", but takes forward year by year environmental policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In January this year we published the United Kingdom's strategy on "Sustainable Development" to take forward our Rio commitments. The four documents involved deal with the strategy for sustainable development, a climate change programme, a biodiversity action plan and a sustainable forestry programme. [

If funds for set aside come from the environment budget, was that the case in 1991? If that has changed, when did it change and for what reason?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is very experienced—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was all one question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just wondering how she could present it as one question. I shall think about that while the Minister answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no separate vote on environmental matters in the European Community. The hon. Lady has almost answered her own question. One of the issues raised by the Court of Auditors' report was that, as in domestic policy, many policies, such as agricultural policies, should be integrated into environmental policy. A criticism in the report was that money for structural fund initiatives was being spent through projects particularly in some of the southern states of the Community, which was actually working directly against any objective test of environmental policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was why the Court of Auditors' report recommended that structural fund operations should conform more closely to Community environmental policies. As a consequence of the criticism that environmental objectives were not sufficiently integrated into Community policies as a whole, the Commission produced its report on sustainability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My interest is why it appears from the document that the money is set aside for innovation and expensive experiment, rather than common sense expenditure and simple prevention of environmental damage. Let me take the example in paragraph 3.10 of the document of the Athens underground, which costs 178 million ecu and is seen as an environmentally justifiable project. Yet because United Kingdom rail freight does not have a subsidy, it is becoming unattractive to people who transport petrochemicals from, for example, Grangemouth in my constituency. That is stopping use of the Oban depot, causing massive environmental pollution on the west coast of Scotland from the new lorry transport that takes its petroleum fill-ups there. It is stopping also the use of the Bishopbriggs depot by Shell, which puts 5,000 new lorries on the road every year transporting petrochemical products from Grangemouth. Does the Minister think that it is possible that the audit looks too much at large projects and not enough at simple subsidy by the European Community for continuing the use of rail rather than road transport? That would constitute a massive saving to the environment and, in the light of the new reports, would benefit the health of the population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Community spends considerable sums on projects such as structural funds. We hope to win for this country substantial sums from, for example, the European regional development fund. It is clearly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
important that that money should be spent in accordance with best environmental practice and so as to support the objects of sustainable development. That is why we were keen on greater integration between the structural fund and European Community environmental laws and policies—precisely to ensure that we avoid projects such as those mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, which are on a large scale but which seem to conflict with other environmental objects. One of our objectives has been the greening of the uses to which Community money is put. That has increasingly been achieved. Indeed, we always want to ensure that regional conversion plans for areas in this country with objective 2 and objective 5b eligibility accord with best environmental practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend confident that EC money is no longer being used to finance environmentally damaging projects in countries such as Greece and Spain, as the report describes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the Commission now has much better mechanisms in place for ensuring that that does not happen. After all, since the report was published, major steps forward have been taken. The Maastricht treaty put the environment firmly at the heart of Community policy, by ensuring that environmental concerns are integrated into other policy areas. The fifth action programme has been published. That is a strategy for Community environmental policy to the year 2000. As I hope that I made clear in my opening comments, we have now obtained far better integration and co-ordination, in the European Commission, of arrangements that will promote a clearer overall environmental strategy. The monitoring and co-ordination of the fifth action programme across the Commission should ensure that the risks to which my hon. Friend refers are minimised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A major problem has just been mentioned by the Minister—that of obtaining co-ordination throughout the European Community on environmental issues. Might not checks operate, at least procedurally, through the institutions of the European Community and through our scrutiny procedures? Subsidiarity, for which I have little time, is an item on a check list. It has to be discussed by the Commission, the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament, Members of Parliament through the procedures of the House and the European Legislation Committee, and through the presentation of the views of the relevant Government Department. Would not it be fruitful to make the environment a similar consideration, to be raised at each stage of the process, whether the subject was agriculture, trade, defence or anything else? At least there would be an opportunity to alert those concerned to the problems of the environment and to the need for co-ordination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes some interesting points. First, under the Maastricht treaty the Commission is now required to take account of the environmental impact of projects and the principles of sustainable growth. It has not been fully taken on board what the Maastricht treaty does to promote environmental policies. It provides incentives to put environ-
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
mental concerns at the heart of not only national but also Community policies. Sustainable growth—respecting the environment—is listed as part of the basic task of the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been another recent achievement. Often there have been worries that environmental directives are not imposed rigorously in every member state. However, the Commission is bringing together an inspectorate of inspectors. Bodies such as Her Majesty's inspectorate of pollution and similar organisations throughout Europe are being brought together to exchange information and, in a sense, monitor each other. That will ensure that there is far greater and more equal applicability of directives and legislation throughout the Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me bring the Minister down to the facts. How much is it estimated was lost from public funds due to fraud in 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993? How reliable does he think the estimates are? What measures has he taken to improve the ability to identify the sources of fraud? I ask him again: is set aside part of an environmental heading or not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Court of Auditors' report speaks for itself. In so far as the report identified any fraud, that is in the report. However, the core to the report's conclusions was not that there were worries of widespread fraud in environmental policy. It was not stated that the Community, the Commission or the peoples of Europe were being ripped off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The complaint was that some of the national audits that were carried out on six member states revealed that some countries—not Britain—were going ahead with major projects, sometimes funded by the Community through structural funds, that were in conflict with environmental policies. The worry was not so much about fraud, but the integration of environmental policy into decision-making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Set aside and the common agricultural policy are not environmental policies as such within the terms of the Court of Auditors' report. That makes the point: in Britain and in the Community it would be nonsensical to have a policy of sustainable development towards land use without paying regard to agricultural policy. It is imperative that in agricultural policy, as elsewhere, best practice is incorporated into policy making. That is what the Government seek to ensure in British agricultural policy and we must ensure that the CAP does the same throughout the Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Minister to the document and the guiding principles listed in it. The document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"preventive action should be taken, priority should be given to making good environmental damage at source, the polluter should pay."</p></blockquote>
Do the Government subscribe to the principle that the polluter must pay? Is the proposed imposition of VAT on domestic fuel an application of the principle? If so, how will his Department ensure that the proceeds of the tax will make good the damage which the payees are causing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I commend to the hon. Gentleman the White Paper "This Common Inheritance", which was published when Chris Patten was Secretary of State for the Environment. Its opening chapter on first principles is an excellent exposition of environmental policy and clearly sets out the concept that the polluter must pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the imposition of VAT on fuel will assist Britain in meeting its target to reduce C02 emissions. The hon. Gentleman will know that there is not hypothecation of taxes in this country. However, as part of our programme to promote energy efficiency, we are extending substantially programmes such as the home energy efficiency scheme. The imposition of VAT on fuel will boost interest in energy efficiency. That will help us to meet our CO
	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> targets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much of the money available for environmental action went into studies or pilot projects? What checks exist to ensure that studies or pilot projects are funded from the environmental budget on the basis of their viability?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In environmental policy, it is important that there is the closest possible integration of those carrying out research. One of the consequences of the Court of Auditors' report was to bring together two director-generals within the Commission—DG XI and DG XII. They both had some responsibility for research on environmental matters, but the research programmes of the directorates are now much better integrated. That will ensure that money spent by the Commission on environmental matters will be put to the best possible use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the Minister to another of the guiding principles which is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"priority should be given to making good environmental damage at source".</p></blockquote>
Is the Department guided by that principle when it considers appeals from organisations that wish to set up waste disposal centres in areas that are not the originators of the waste and where local authorities are resistant to other area's waste being brought into them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In any complex society, there is a need to manage effectively and deal with waste. That is an environmental priority. Therefore, we have clear targets for recycling. In addition, before such major developments are built, they may require an environmental impact assessment depending on their size. Those are all matters that are taken carefully into consideration if an appeal is made against the refusal of a local authority to permit the development of such a waste disposal plant. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will take them into account when deciding whether to grant an appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister understands that I did not find his previous answer satisfactory. Basically, it was a lot of waffle, which did not deal with the problem that I mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I ask specifically whether he agrees that many of the funds from the European Community go into pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
jects that are politically sexy or respond to pressure groups? They are not taking enough advantage of the prevention of pollution by simply dealing with problems that already exist. Under paragraphs 2.15 to 2.17 on the "grant of operation subsidies", a lot more could be done to make proven environmentally beneficial forms of transport more attractive financially. Is the provision in paragraph 0.9
	<br><blockquote><p>"for a cohesion fund for four Member States in the sphere of transport and the environment"</p></blockquote>
relevant to the United Kingdom? Might not more be done if we focus on preventive measures that do not require large infrastructure and building? Everything that I read in the document refers to contractors. The European Community seems to be lashing money at buildings and experimentation rather than stopping environmental pollution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's hypothesis. The United Kingdom will soon receive increasingly large sums of money from the European Community through the European regional development fund. I am quite sure that the entire House will want to ensure that those funds are used and applied to projects that are environmentally sound. Indeed, there is nothing to prevent those areas that are entitled to receive ERDF money from coming forward with proposals for projects that incorporate transport as an integral part. That is already happening in Sheffield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that in many other parts of the country that are eligible for ERDF funding local communities will work in partnership and bring forward such proposals. It is everyone's responsibility to ensure that Community funds that come forward under ERDF whether for objective 1 on Merseyside and Northern Ireland or objective 2 in large parts elsewhere in the UK or 5B in rural areas are put to projects that enhance environmental objectives. There is no difficulty about that. It is our responsibility to ensure that that is done. That is why the Government have a process to ensure that those moneys are spent in a way that promotes good environmental practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Dunwoody</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As there is an opaque quality about the definition of environmental funds, can the Minister tell us how many convictions for fraud there have been in the last two years for people misusing money marked for environmental action?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this moment I cannot answer the hon. Lady as it does not arise directly out of the court of auditors' report but I will make inquiries to see what information is available and I will write to her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, may I refer the Minister to the three guiding principles, the first of which is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"preventative action should be taken".</p></blockquote>
Is not the Minister's Department seriously concerned that the Government's present obsession with deregulation might fly in the face of that guiding principle?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. We are seeking with the deregulation initiative to ensure that the only regulations that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
are in place are those that need to be there. In a complex society there will always be a need for a range of laws and regulations. No one has any quarrel for that. But for all sorts of reasons regulations can become obsolete. If we are not careful there is an overlap of regulations which leads to red tape and unnecessary bureaucracy. We need to ensure that mechanisms are in place to prevent a sclerosis of regulations on industry, business, those seeking to create jobs and others. There is no quarrel with that and with having good environmental policies. We need to ensure that the regulations that are in place are needed and are not unnecessary and unwanted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That the Committee takes note of European Community Document No. 7909/92, the Court of Auditors Special Report No. 3/92 concerning the environment; welcomes its recommendations as to how the Commission and Member States can pursue Community environmental policy more effectively, with better management and monitoring of the instruments used to put environmental policy into effect; and endorses the Report's call for the objectives of the Structural Funds to be pursued and achieved in compliance with Community environmental policy,—[

	<p>11.29 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have grave doubts about the Government's intention and performance in respect of various directives and these documents. Like the Secretary of State for Social Security, the right hon. Member for St. Albans (Mr. Lilley), I have a little list which it might be helpful to share with the Committee. It emanates from a copy of a confidential memorandum that apparently the United Kingdom and French Governments signed on various directives. I should like to go through some of the responses that we understand those Governments have made jointly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I do that, it is important to say that whatever the public feel about Brussels and the bureaucracy of the European Union, they clearly trust Brussels on the environment more than they trust the UK Government. That is an important consequence of the Government's application of or non-compliance with the various directives. There are four areas on this Anglo-French hit list where the French or British Governments are trying to weaken things. That is disturbing. On the drinking water directive that was agreed by the Government in 1980 there is clear evidence that the Government simply are not meeting the standards that are required. That is not evidence that has been provided by some outside source or even from Europe: the Government's drinking water inspectorate has shown repeatedly that millions of households in the UK received substandard drinking water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In November 1992 the Government were found guilty in the European Court over the nitrate levels in
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
water supplied by Anglian Water. When there is every reason why they should comply with the directive and people are demanding better water standards, what is the Government's response? It is not to improve their performance but to sidle up with the French in an attempt to weaken the directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same can be said of the Government's attitude to the bathing water directive which was agreed as long ago as 1975 when a Labour Government was in power. Yet again, all the evidence shows that the Government's compliance with that directive is extremely poor. They are seriously and strenuously trying to dodge it. This may be a slight improvement for them but on that directive we are only the second dirtiest man in Europe with Belgium being the worst. Only 36 per cent. of the beaches notified meet the guideline. Of particular concern to me and my hon. Friends the Members for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) and for Knowsley, South (Mr. O'Hara) who are hardy enough to survive the course of this Committee is the fact that the north west in particular has received the worst reports on the bathing water directive. The Government were again found guilty recently in the European Court over a case involving Blackpool.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nitrogen dioxide directive was implemented in 1985 by the Government. In trying to monitor the implementation of that directive the Government's Warren Springs laboratory found in 1991 that there were 12 sites in London and Sheffield where the legal limits set in the directive had been exceeded. What was the Government's response? Did they clean up their act? No, they closed down Warren Springs laboratory and are now trying to get the directive scrapped completely. Why do not they do something more constructive like cleaning up their act rather than always reacting against the bodies and organisations that point out their failings?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final example is the wild birds directive. That was agreed in 1979 with the purpose of protecting habitats, eggs and nests. Part of the deal in the little hit list agreed between the French and UK Governments is that that should be scrapped. They are approaching the Commission with a view to doing just that. For once I do not have a particular criticism to make of this Government, but they are falling into line with the French Government who have been put under pressure by the French hunting lobby. Therefore, there is a potential watering-down or weakening of a directive that has served well and is important for the protection of habitats, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier, loosely in the form of a question, to the process of environmental impact assessment, especially as it relates to the structural fund; paragraph 1.18 of the report refers specifically to that aspect. It is important carefully to examine the issue of EIA in both the European and United Kingdom contexts. The Government should have a clearer idea of what EIA means, what indicators should be taken into account and how the procedures should be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may cite two examples from my constituency with which, at least, my hon. Friend the Member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
for Knowsley, South will be familiar. There have been two serious protests: first, against a proposed incinerator in Knowsley and, more recently, against a proposed landfill site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not discuss the merits or demerits of either of those proposals. However, both developers commissioned what they called EIAs of their proposals. I shall not cast doubt on the documents; they were professionally produced and, as far as I know, those who carried out the assessments were properly scientifically qualified and they probably did a good job. However, the public in my constituency have a difficulty: if an EIA is carried out on behalf of a developer, they will not trust it. No matter how valid such an EIA may be, the general public, local authorities and others will never entirely trust it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, especially with a major road programme and the various industrial development works that will be carried out under the structural funds, it is important to examine in more depth the issue of EIAs and to implement a proper system in which people can have confidence. The report makes that point. The Government should press more vigorously in Europe and within their own sphere of responsibility in the United Kingdom to ensure that such a system is properly worked out and that there are proper indicators so that people can be happy with and have confidence in the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am deeply unhappy. The report makes a number of points—the Government have made similar points—about the principles on which co-ordination between structural funds and/or other funds is carried out. How do the various sections of the European Union respond—for example, how does the Commission respond—to ensure that, in meeting the objectives of various structural funds, the environmental objectives are met in full? I believe that there could be a major improvement. It is a truism, but it is worth repeating, that acid rain, lack of proper control of sewage, and so on, know no national boundaries. The impact of emissions from power stations in this country is felt in forests in Denmark, Sweden and elsewhere in Scandanavia. Unsatisfactory sewage disposal in France can have an impact on our beaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it seems proper that the procedures for co-ordinating action between member states and within the European Union itself need to be fully and properly worked out. The criticisms made in the report should be noted and should be seen to be effectively acted upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's complacency does not give me any confidence that the Government are playing their full and proper role in pushing for co-ordination. The Government's record in not co-ordinating their own Departments in response to environmental damage does not lead me to believe that they can play that role in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is high time that we became involved in such issues. Instead of the Government constantly seeking to dodge directives and to evade their responsibilities, they should play a full part in the European Union and in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Commission so that those bodies carry out their functions well. We cannot leave the matter to rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends made the criticism that we have waited a long time for the documents to be brought before the Committee. It was not necessarily the result of an accident. There is every reason to believe that the Government are so ashamed of their record that they want to allow us as few opportunities as possible to criticise them. I am glad that we have had this opportunity. I hope that it will make some difference to the way in which the Government act in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Crewe and Nantwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The report is most interesting. It is a catalogue of criticisms, not one of which has been answered by the Minister. We should realise that if the Committee is to operate effectively, it must not only use its powers fully to question the Minister for an hour, but it must expect Ministers to come before it armed with adequate information. The Minister is a courteous and helpful man. However, it is not good enough for the Government to suppress the report for 16 months and then expect the Committee to accept the blithe assurance that the Commission has appointed one or two extra officers in DGs XI and XII and that that will solve the difficulty. We have already heard a damning condemnation of the way in which the Commission is handling environmental matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fascinating to have a report that uses such neutral language in considering the implications. Paragraph 1.11 on page 9 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This spread of responsibilities requires substantial coordination."</p></blockquote>
It adds that many of the operations funded under environmental appropriations cannot be properly traced. Amounts of money have disappeared and there have been problems with contracts and at Community and national level. Paragraph 1.6 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"careful itemization and detailing of expenditure are essential."</p></blockquote>
The Report quotes some extraordinary cases in which audits in six different countries found the most bizarre instances of people using Community money in a way that could not be justified and even defied belief. One establishment took vast amounts of money to set up a special pilot project, but it did not do anything about it and had not even found the site on which to put the project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should receive specific, not general, information. Anyone who knows the Commission as well as I do knows that one can appoint as may civil servants as one likes, but that will not make the slightest bit of difference if people in Italy and Greece pocket structural funds without giving accurate information to those who are writing the cheques. It is clear from the report that that has happened on a large scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2.9 on page 17 of the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In order to ensure that the aid is used correctly and for the activities concerned, contracts contain a clause to the effect that evidence of the expenditure must be provided."</p></blockquote>
It then goes on to outline the difficulties that arise when people try to get hold of that evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
When the report refers to cash advances, fraud and moneys that are spirited away it makes it clear that the Commission is not expected to do separate audits for individual contracts. Member states are expected to do that work and to produce the evidence when the Governments and Parliaments, such as ours, ask for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not give us detailed information. Following the detailed cases in the report, I want to know what specific measures the Government have demanded for monitoring fraud. I want to know what evidence there is of tightening up or of change. I want to know how many people were prosecuted in the Community. I want to know how much taxpayers' money has been used. If it has been used, who has it? How many lagoons have we bought round the Mediterranean? Members of Parliament would like to send out a little notice to their constituents saying, "Do you know that you own a lagoon? You might like to know its site so that you can nip in there the next time that you are passing.'
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two aspects of the Government's reaction to this matter. First, they sat on the report for as long as they dared in the hope that, with any luck, Parliament would not notice, but that if it did, hon. Members would be so convinced that the report was out of date that they would not ask awkward questions. Secondly, the Government have done nothing practical to insist that the auditors' report was followed up in a way that could be demonstrated to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the simple question of the criteria used to define environmental projects. If the Commission has a problem with trying to determine whether the structural funds are being used correctly, the first thing that it should do is to set down clearly what is and what is not an environmental project. I should not have thought that that was a difficult concept. In this Parliament, not just the Public Accounts Committee, but the National Audit Office and all those involved in using public moneys have specific terms under which they can list what is happening. They bring that before Parliament and they expect to be questioned and to have detailed information available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a cheerful and cavalier manner, the Community seems to ignore that classification and, if it needs to, produces a report, such as the report of the Court of Auditors, which gives no evidence of the follow up. With the greatest respect, glossy reports—which say how nice it would be if we all got together and did this in the next five years—are no substitute for accurate information about what is actually happening. We have not been given that information this morning. We have not been told where the report is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The motions before us states that the Committee "takes note" of the European Community document from the Court of Auditors and that the Community should manage its environmental policy "more effectively". That is not exactly a ringing call to arms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very concerned about what is before us this morning. The Court of Auditors' report spells out exactly why the auditors are worried. First, nobody
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
knows what is an environmental project. Secondly, nobody knows what is happening to the money that comes from the Commission, except that it is disappearing, not down the black hole of Calcutta, but down the shifting sands of the lagoons of the Mediterranean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, they have said that if something is going to be done, Parliaments should be demanding much better and more accurate information. They have also said that despite an appreciable level of activity, it is doubtful, given the current speed at which environmental directives are being applied, that they will be sufficient to produce significant changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report is probably the clearest that the Commission has produced for many years. It states what is happening, what is wrong and what has to be done to fix things. The Minister then says, "Don't worry about it. It has taken a long time for the report to come before the Houses of Parliament, but it has all been tightened up a bit, it's all better and we do not need to worry about it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to worry about it. The British people are sick to the back teeth of what is happening in the Community. Institutions are not created by producing a paper with a new title and by telling everyone that a new name will be used in future. Institutions are created by producing machinery which the taxpayers understand, identify with and are at least satisfied is working properly. If that is not done, we have failed as a scrutiny Committee and as elected Members to look after the taxpayers' interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the nonsense that we talk in Committee about good intentions, making the polluter pay and changing the future of the environment is a waste of time and of breath because we are not effectively monitoring legislation that is being operated in our name and in the name of our taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has come to the Committee with the intention of helping, but he is not properly briefed and not properly equipped. He should tell the Cabinet that there is cynicism and contempt in the British electorate about what is happening in the Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. David Lidington 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aylesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with a great deal of what the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the report does not describe outright corruption and fraud, it certainly provides a catalogue of waste on a dramatic and appalling scale. It amounts to a report of how British and other taxpayers are being ripped off by a bureaucracy which manages to be profligate and incompetent at the same time, by Governments, by project managers and by agencies in various member states which, as the hon. Lady said, are out to pocket whatever funds happen to be available with precious little regard for EC law or the principles underlying the policies which the funds are supposed to promote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not like lobbing grenades at my hon. Friend the Minister, especially as we are now in the same European constituency, but the Government have to express
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
in their language and their style the outrage that they should feel on behalf of taxpayers who are being treated shamefully by the sort of abuses that the Court of Auditors' report describes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's response to the report is complacent. There was a disgraceful delay between its publication and its scrutiny by the Committee. I asked the Library for a report of the debate in the European Parliament on this important subject. I was sure that a copy would have been held, but a check was made and I was told that the European Parliament had given no consideration to the matter. My point is not a party political one. The report suggests to me unwarranted torpor and abdication of responsibility by that institution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend and, without meaning to come to the aid of the European Parliament, on which I served for five years, I should say that its trouble is that in spending so much time on matters with which it should not be involved, it neglects its true role as many of us see it—of hounding the member states and the Commission on such matters as we are describing. Everything turns on accountability, and the European Parliament should be the main instrument using the Court of Auditors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lidington</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Harris) and, if I may be permitted one sentence that goes slightly astray, I shall mention that it reinforces the case for a rigorous examination of the constitutional structure of the European Union and the checks to be imposed by Strasbourg and by national Parliaments when the next round of intergovernmental conferences is reached in 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth taking note of one or two of the descriptions in the report of the misuse of significant sums of British and other European taxpayers' money. Paragraph 1.8 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The programmes do very little towards translating this approach"—</p></blockquote>
a theoretical approach—
	<br><blockquote><p>"into operational terms."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 1.14 states that the auditors can obtain
	<br><blockquote><p>"very little documentation concerning the work done by the various departments and Directorates General".</p></blockquote>
According to paragraph 2.5, contracts
	<br><blockquote><p>"are … superficial at the decision and implementation stages."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 3.20 offers the opinion—I thought this one was a classic—that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is not, therefore, in the measures receiving aid from the Structural Funds, any very clear link between the investments financed and the protection of the environment."</p></blockquote>
From paragraph 3.21 we learn that
	<br><blockquote><p>"considerable progress is still necessary to prevent the projects being financed from contributing to the deterioration of the environment".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Paragraph 3.27 deals with an aid application that apparently
	<br><blockquote><p>"declared that the investment would be 'without negative effects', when, in fact, it involved the deforestation of a vast wooded area and the pollution of significant quantities of water."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 5.2 states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is a significant gap between the set of rules in force and their actual application."</p></blockquote>
That brings us back to precisely the case that the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich has been making. It is incumbent on British Ministers to pursue energetically and in great detail, relying on the expertise of our officials in Whitehall and UKREP, reforms of the Commission's organisation, of the scrutiny functions exercised by the different Community institutions and of the rules of procedure, which are necessary to prevent repetition of this disgraceful history of events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During my undergraduate and post-graduate history studies, I always looked to that great master, Frederick William Maitland, who wrote, at the beginning of his history of English law, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the history of law is found in the interstices of procedure".</p></blockquote>
Unless we get the procedure right and are prepared as politicians to grasp the detail, action plans and White Paper, however many, will not give our people and those of Europe the deal that they deserve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward O'Hara 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by echoing the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth). He criticised the Government's record of compliance with directives from Brussels. I was astonished by the Minister's opening remarks. He claimed that the Government have a record of which we can be proud and which is the envy of Europe. I shall not burden the Committee by repeating the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North. With reference to purity of water, however, I should not let my grandchildren swim off a beach on Merseyside or parts of north-west England, where the sea is increasingly polluted. The Government are responsible for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall confine my remarks to the three guiding principles, which I mentioned in my questions. Those principles are: preventive action; making good at source; the polluter pays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us first consider preventive action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear to anyone who has half a grain of sense that the drive for deregulation is DTI-led, abetted by the Treasury and motivated by profit. It has nothing to do with protecting the consumer or the environment. Environmental protection is expensive—the DTI and the Treasury know that. It is of secondary importance to them. I should have appreciated a clear statement of the Department of the Environment's plans for ensuring that full account of environmental protection will be taken in the drive for deregulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 1.15 of the document refers to the need for better co-ordination between Departments in member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
states of the European Union. Let us examine the effects of the deregulation policies of one of the great state Departments—the Department of Transport. People who use buses—not Ministers—know that a major effect of deregulation is cheap operators who run clapped-out buses, which pollute the environment more than the buses that were provided by respectable public services in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of the Environment does not protest about the effects on the environment of the policies of another Department. I refer to VAT on fuel. The Government seemed to be prepared to introduce severe differentials in VAT on leaded and unleaded petrol, but I notice that the gap has narrowed and the principle has been abandoned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) mentioned the Athens metro. From visits to Athens over many years, I know that great environmental justification exists for the Athens metro. Athens was built in a hollow between the mountains of Imittós and the sea. A large part of the population of Greece lives in Athens, where there are too many cars. A tremendous problem of environmental pollution exists in that city. Greece is trying to eliminate the problems in Athens by developments to the underground system. Contrast that with what is happening in this country where our underground system is falling apart. The Department of Transport is involved in a Gadarene rush into road building while the public transport infrastructure falls apart. People are forced off the railways through lack of investment, so we have a declining service and rising prices. People are forced into taking their cars on to the roads and to use the commuting buses that I mentioned, yet the Department of the Environment is making the proud claim that it is protecting our environment which is being polluted. So much for preventive action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the Minister's fine words, the Government are gravely deficient in that respect and I refer him to the second of the guiding principles—making good environmental damage at source. My hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North said much of what I might have said about the subject and, like him, I am concerned about the attempt to introduce dirty jobs through waste disposal in our areas. We are suffering so much unemployment that it is thought that our people will take any jobs at any cost but, of course, they will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to that as the double indemnity of our areas. We suffer pollution of our environment from the dirty trades that have gone and their jobs with them and we are now being offered the dirt from jobs created by industry elsewhere. I seriously appeal to the Minister and the Department of the Environment to consider carefully what my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and I have said about how we must seek support from the Department when we resist the dumping of waste on us in accordance with the guiding principle that pollution should be made good at source. Instead, the Government proclaim themselves as the world leader in waste disposal and take pride in importing waste from all over the world for disposal in this
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
country. It is a claim of sorts, but not one of which I would be particularly proud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the principle that the polluter should pay, I referred to VAT on domestic fuel bills. That is a cruel deceit of taxpayers and a tax that is Treasury driven. It is not environmentally driven out of a real concern about CO
	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions and if the Government had really been concerned about that they would have introduced a carbon tax. They should also have been concerned about the other pollution from vehicles on roads. The position is made even worse because big users can even delay paying the tax by making payments in advance. That is another example of the hollowness of the Government's claim to have been environmentally motivated when they imposed the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North about the policies of the Department of the Environment and the co-ordination of policies between the different Departments of state. The Government have much to answer to the electorate for in respect of their shortcomings on environmental policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make two points. The first is about the Court of Auditors and the paradox that it is probably one of the underfunded sections of the European Community given the range of work that needs to be done. As the institutions of the European Community have massive democratic deficits and the scrutiny and accountability procedures are inadequate, the Court of Auditors has an important role to play in alerting everyone in the European Community to the problems of inadequate expenditure, controls and checks. Funding given to the Court of Auditors—given the report we are considering—would be of value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the court produces its report, there is complacency in the Commission and there is a host of non-responses. Reference has already been made to delay in this Committee. The failure of the European Parliament to get round to discussing the matter indicates the depth of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns action programmes and what should be done to contain pollution problems throughout the European Community. We have discussed structural funds and new programmes. There is a problem—listed in the report—with programmes that produce further pollution. Ready-made pollution exists throughout the European Community. There are proposals for making the polluter pay. We also need programmes to advance investment and overcome pollution problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were starting from scratch—we start from scratch in an area with structural problems—and we were going through a new technological revolution and planning ahead, we would not have the environmental problems that we have now. We would not put people, farms and industry next to one another, with one having adverse effects on the others. Often pollution problems
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
are handled by improved processes and improved investment, but there is a paradox. New, improved methods increase production and output in works that have been held to be guilty of pollution. The Commission should, in action programmes, be dealing with that problem. What assistance is required by industry or what nudging needs to be done to industry to get it to come up with solutions to the problem of the pollution that it creates. Such a solution should not be at the expense of closing down or shifting firms. People who live in affected areas should not have to face pollution problems any longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need centralised solutions that deal with the problems. If we overcame the democratic deficit in Europe, bodies such as the European Parliament would deal with the problem. We would be concerned at a national level. Environmental issues have become a European concern because pollution knows no boundaries. We need to co-operate and work together in the European Community while having our own checks and scrutiny procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.14 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had two debates on this part of the Commission's scrutiny. Most hon. Members have examined the report by the Court of Auditors. The hon. Members for Knowsley, North and for Bootle (Mr. Benton) used the opportunity for a knockabout attack on the Government's general environmental policy. I will deal with that in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal first with the substantive debate which arose from the Court of Auditor's report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. My hon. Friend the Member for Bootle has not been seen in Committee all morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Hara</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I represent Knowsley, South.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Members for Knowsley, North and for Knowsley, South used the debate not to discuss anything to do with the Court of Auditors but to attack the Government's environmental policies. I am happy to respond to that and will do so in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I want to respond to the substantive debate on the Court of Auditors. To reiterate what I said at the outset, the Court of Auditors report highlighted serious concerns about how the Community and the Commission were carrying out environmental policies. If hon. Members re-read what I said in my introduction, they would realise that it is clearly set out that the United Kingdom Government are and were concerned about how the Commission monitored and implemented the policies. For that reason, we welcome the fact that the Commission has got to grips with the problem and has introduced the fifth action programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should have spent more time discussing the fifth action programme. Its significance might not have been fully taken on board. I appreciate that the syntax
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
in the title is not what we would normally expect to have in policy making in Britain. However, the fifth action programme sets out principles of shared responsibility and the polluter should pay. More importantly—and this responds to the valid points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)—the fifth action programme sets out objectives, performance targets and the action needed to achieve those. For each topic of environmental concern, be it climate change or integrated pollution control, it is clear what the Commission wants to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the Court of Auditors report, along with pressure from the United Kingdom Government and others to improve the integration of environmental policies in the Community, has led to the publication of a coherent document. I think that it is the first time that we have had such a coherent document about environmental policy in the Community. Additionally, since the Court of Auditors report, the Maastricht treaty has been implemented. That makes the environment an integral part of Community action. Equally importantly, there have been fairly substantial reforms to the organisation of the Commission in delivering environmental policy. Those reforms ensure that mechanisms exist in the Commission to guarantee that one director-general will know what another is doing in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report looks back at the 1988 budget, which was reported to Parliament in 1992. We made it clear in our response to the Court of Auditors report that it was unacceptable. I hope that that was made perfectly clear. I think that any fair-minded person who reads my opening comments this morning will acknowledge that we recognised the budget as unacceptable, but that we welcome the fact that since then, decisive action has been taken by the Commission. In many ways, that action has mirrored the leads that we have given on integrating environmental initiatives throughout policy formulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich made some valid points, but she repeatedly almost answered her own questions on what is environmental policy. The thrust of what we are saying is that environmental policies cannot be neatly compartmentalised. Environmental policies apply right across policy making, which is why it is crucial to consider the environmental impact of any policy formulation and why we seek to ensure that environmental policies are integrated into everything that we do. That will happen within the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady was anxious about fraud. I shall respond in detail to her specific questions. There is a danger in the Community of creating feeling that it is redolent with fraud and corruption. In fact, of the 62 becu budget in 1992, only 117 mecu were allegedly lost in fraud. Of course, that is 117 mecu too many. But it is important to put that into perspective otherwise one is distracted into suggesting that, if only one could root out fraud from the Community, everything else would be all right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must always learn from the lessons of history. Often within the Community, the enemy of good practice is not fraud but, as was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury, (Mr. Lidington), not having the proper mechanisms and processes of government. We need to ensure that we have such processes, and the Commission is now moving in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee has rightly spent some time on the matter, I shall briefly respond to the points made by the hon. Members for Knowsley, North and for Knowsley, South. The suggestion that the United Kingdom is somehow lacking in commitment to environmental protection and high environmental standards does not stand up to scrutiny. As I have said, we have implemented 102 out of the 110 directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of what was said about the drinking water directive is completely fanciful, as 98.7 per cent. of the 3.75 million drinking water tests carried out in England met the relevant standards. There is no suggestion that Britain and other member states are doing shady deals. Our aim is to have good-quality drinking water with standards based on sound scientific knowledge. The Commission is bringing forward specific proposals to implement the policy that was endorsed by the Community at the December 1993 summit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the bathing waters directive, 80 per cent. of bathing waters complied with directives in 1993—a substantial improvement over recent years far from the figure of 38 per cent. mentioned by the hon. Member for Knowsley, North. His comments on the air quality directive were simply fanciful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth stating that United Kingdom legislation to implement the directive on environmental impact assessment was brought into force within a matter of days in July 1988. We have an impressive record on environmental action and one of which we can be proud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
I return to the Court of Auditors' report, of which we have taken note. Following the report, the Council of Ministers has adopted new structural fund regulations which contain the stronger environmental provisions which we in the United Kingdom have pressed for. The Department of the Environment is fully involved in decision making on all structural fund matters in England and other environmental bodies are consulted as required. We shall ensure that every penny of EC money that comes to the United Kingdom is spent in a way that accords with the best principles of environmental protection and sustainable development. It is significant that nowhere in the Court of Auditors' report was there criticism of the way in which structural fund projects in the United Kingdom have been used or a scintilla of criticism on environmental grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not be complacent about the report and we have not been. I invite the Committee to endorse the report's call for the objectives of the structural funds to be pursued and achieved in compliance with Community environmental policy. That is what the Community must do and I hope that the Committee will endorse that objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
