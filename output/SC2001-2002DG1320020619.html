It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cummings. I see some more familiar faces: the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Government Whip, my Liberal Democrat colleague, the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed), and some old sweats on the Government Back Benches, temporarily posted to the front.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: And some sweat-heads as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are important regulations. The crucial question on any legislation concerning farming, animal welfare and animal and human health—we have debated this before in similar Committees, and also on the Floor of the House—is whether the public have confidence in the Government's intentions, in the aim and purpose of the legislation, and in the Department responsible for originating and implementing the legislation. The Minister is faced with both a general and a specific crisis of confidence regarding his Department and legislation. I do not say that in any parti pris way; I base it on, for example, evidence given to the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs this morning by the permanent secretary, who was given a fairly rough ride by everyone—both Labour and Opposition Members—in connection with many aspects of the Department, not least the question of public confidence and the confidence of the House. I think that when the Minister has had time to read the verbatim report of the question-and-answer session, he will note the profound disquiet felt by members of the Committee about whether the Department could deliver on many vital issues. I fully accept that the Department faces grave challenges on issues relating to farming, animal welfare and human health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Credibility is a serious problem for the Department and for Ministers, whether in relation to farmers, the food industry, environmentalists or the public. There is a worrying tendency to disbelieve what the Department says now. The public should be able to assume that, within reason, they can believe what the Government tell them. There will always be those in opposition, or specific groups, who do not want to believe a Government or a Department, but the current tendency to disbelieve automatically extends beyond the Opposition and the media, and I think that that is a specific problem for DEFRA. Ministers and the Department therefore have a great obligation to
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
get things right. There must be total transparency, and they must fully justify any legislation, especially in the highly sensitive area of human health and animal welfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that one of the problems affecting this legislation was the whole sorry business of the Animal Health Bill. It had a rough passage through the House. I distinctly remember debates on the Floor during which the Government had great difficulty in finding any of their Back Benchers, many of them distinguished members of the Select Committee, who were prepared to give it any form of enthusiastic backing. The Animal Health Bill eventually fell in the other place. It has left a cross-party feeling of grave disquiet in the House and in the other place about the Government's motives and the practicalities of the matter. It certainly caused grave disquiet in the farming community and among people associated with animal welfare. One might have thought, given that experience, that the Government would have been very sensitive in the way in which they introduced legislation, even legislation required by the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have the unhappy experience of these regulations. The Government have no one to blame but themselves for the muddle that they have got themselves into over the regulations. They conform with the European Community TSE regulations and revoke and replace much existing national legislation, providing powers and penalties. The statutory instrument is 89 pages long and has 104 regulations. It is not an easy document to follow and we now know that it was somewhat hastily drafted, and not particularly well, according to the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. You will be aware, Mr. Cummings, that the 29th report of that Committee said that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"draws the special attention of both Houses to these Regulations on the ground that they are defectively drafted in a number of respects."</p></blockquote>
I will not detain the Committee by reading out the relevant aspects of that report. The Government have, quite rightly, had to respond to it. I think that this is an example of where bad drafting of a complex piece of legislation has made worse the Department's credibility on an issue that was bound to be controversial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further problem is that the Government have failed to take informed opinion with them. I refer in particular to the opinion to be found in the House of Lords. Not only has the legislation concerned many people in the other place, it has concerned large numbers of outside bodies. One would have thought that when the Government drafted and printed the statutory instrument, one could have found it almost straight away on a Government website. I am informed that it in fact took several weeks to appear in a proper form on either a departmental or a Government website.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a challenge for the Department, not least because the Government have rightly placed a great deal of emphasis on electronic communications. More and more farmers, people in the food industry and people concerned with animal welfare use electronic methods to get immediate up-to-date information on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
highly technical pieces of legislation. I know that the Minister believes that that is important and that he has laid much emphasis on it. Can he tell the Committee why there appears to have been a delay in putting this detailed piece of legislation on the website?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all realise that Governments have problems with drafting statutory instruments, but that delay has reinforced an impression among many farmers and Members of both Houses that the Government were attempting to slip through parts of the controversial Animal Health Bill by gold-plating the TSE regulations. Ministers in this House and the Minister's hon. Friend in another place categorically denied it, but the problem that the Minister and the Department now face is the credibility gap. The muddle, to say the least, of the way in which the regulations were drafted meant that many people in another place and many farmers and others outside were prepared to believe the worst. The problem is not for farmers or necessarily for the legislature; it is how the Government recapture credibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate on 15 May in the other place shows the level of concern about the legislation on both sides of that House. There is no doubt in my mind that the Government were panicking then, because they realised that there was so much opposition to the way in which the regulations had been introduced and explained that there was a danger that they would be voted down. That would have been a disaster, because there would have been a great legal black hole in which the Government and everyone connected with the food industry and animal welfare would have been open to all kinds of legal challenges. To make certain that the legislation did not fall, the Government had to whip large numbers of Government supporters in the other place who would not normally participate in such a debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that consideration is now being given in both Houses to whether it will be possible in future to amend such a statutory instrument. I do not have to tell you, Mr. Cummings, that hon. Members vote either for or against a statutory instrument; there is no way in which we can amend it. Therefore, this legislation has in a small way alerted the Government, the Opposition and other senior people in both Houses that there is a loophole in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly consider certain aspects of the regulations and try to tease out from the Minister answers to the questions that have been raised in this House, in another place and by interested bodies outside Parliament. My first point was that the Government must be open and honest about the legislation and re-establish trust with the public and the farming community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The core of the regulations is the need for inspectors to have the power to slaughter animals suspected of being infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy or scrapie, and those confirmed as infected. There is a certain irony in that, because the committee of the European Parliament that is looking into foot and mouth has taken evidence from a large number of scientists and vets, and they all advocate vaccination rather than slaughter. There are also suggestions around the bazaars in Whitehall that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Government's own committees of inquiry may reach similar conclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Mr. Elliot Morley)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Coincidentally, I happen to be reading the transcripts of the evidence that scientists gave on vaccination to the temporary committee at the EU, and it is not true to say that they all advocated vaccination. In fact, most advocated using vaccination alongside slaughter, in varying degrees. It is certainly true that they all advocated greater use of vaccination, and we do not rule that out for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simpson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that contribution. The Minister will also be able to confirm that the Government's own inquiries are likely to reach similar conclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are independent inquiries. I do not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simpson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not know, but I thank him for his previous point. The issue of vaccinations and slaughter is still very controversial. It depends on mixed scientific evidence and causes anxiety and bewilderment, to say the least, among not only the farming community, but those concerned with animal welfare. The issue comes back to the point that I made at the beginning, which is that it is vital for the Government to get their position correct. They cannot be held responsible for misleading newspaper reports, but they must be certain that the information that they provide to the public is as accurate as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have several questions. How do the regulations interact with the Department's national scrapie plan as outlined on the DEFRA website? In the debate in the other place, there appeared to be concern and some confusion about terminology. The Countess of Mar was concerned about the definition of a "TSE-susceptible animal" and claimed that EC regulations give the definition as
	<br><blockquote><p>"an animal suspected of being infected by a TSE".—[
	<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, 15 May 2002; Vol. 635, c. 379.]</p></blockquote>
That is a crucial difference, so will the Minister clarify that point once and for all?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Whitty agreed to re-examine appeals against slaughter notices. Has that been done? A related issue is giving farmers a chance to contest powers of entry to premises, and what is the Minister's legal advice on that? There is a cap of £400 on compensation for sheep and goats, but is the Minister aware that many consider that the price, including for prize pedigree stock, should be the market value? There are only a small number of pedigree animals, but to the people concerned they are crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister aware that the British Veterinary Association is concerned that the legislation includes equines in the definition of livestock? They are not currently subject to any known TSE, and the BVA claims that it could set a precedent for future legislation. The Minister may regard that as totally wrong—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is mad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simpson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says from a sedentary position that the BVA's suggestion is "mad". I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
sure that it will be pleased to hear the Minister's definition of mad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall tell the BVA personally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Simpson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is in a frisky mood, but when one has been in the same job for five years, I imagine that one has little opportunity to be so frisky. A promotion to another Department, perhaps the Department for Transport, might do him the world of good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and Lord Whitty have given the impression in the past that many of the points raised by Members of Parliament, noble Lords and outside interest groups were either fatuous or irrelevant. The Minister's problem is that on several occasions, many of the points that were made about DEFRA and, in the old days the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, were then overtaken by events. In some cases, although not all, it was proved that the points raised were perfectly legitimate and, in many cases, based on some element of fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that the scientific evidence is all too often inconclusive. A good example is the Food Standards Agency's comment about whether it is acceptable to continue to eat lamb. Like many other parliamentarians, I heard a presentation by the FSA several weeks ago and was somewhat alarmed when its chairman said that he was not advising the public not to eat lamb. That is a strange double negative and hardly a full endorsement. I accept that, given what happened with BSE, foot and mouth and swine fever, the public are concerned about animal health. However, one reaches a stage where a double negative endorsement is too easily read by many people as a statement that it is not safe to eat British lamb. The problem all too frequently is that it is safe to eat almost nothing, given the prospect of getting food poisoning of one sort or another. Alas, the Government's own pairing Whip was struck low last week with food poisoning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we discussed in many of our debates, there is a balance between maintaining public health and public confidence, and trying to maintain the viability of the markets of fundamental parts of the British food industry. As I said, the onus is on the Government, and I look forward to the Minister's reply. The Government helped to create many of their problems over the TSE regulations because of the way in which the regulations were drafted and presented. Many problems were also caused by the way in which Ministers answered, or failed to answer, some of the points raised in this House and another place. The Minister may be able to dismiss them as being based on myth or lack of information, but I urge him to make certain, when we discuss the regulations in
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
future, that they are properly drafted and explained, and available electronically from the beginning, as has been promised. I also urge him to ensure that the onus is placed on the Government to make certain that the public, and especially the farming community, have confidence in his Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.52 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cummings, and I apologise for my comments from a sedentary position. The debate is frustrating, as it is based on misunderstandings and on allegations that lack any credibility. I understand some of the issues that independent Members in the other place are promoting. They are free to do what they want, but it is surprising to find the official Opposition picking up conspiracy theories and allegations that have no basis in fact. Bringing people here for a debate of this sort that is based on such nonsense is to be regretted. Hon. Members who have shown such loyal support on this Committee deserve better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I will deal in some detail with the points made by the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson), and I hope that Opposition Members take careful note. I am sorry to relate my remarks to him, as he does a good job on behalf of the Opposition. As he said, we have debated statutory instruments together many times. The greatest attention may not have been given to their detail, but they are all important and have a bearing. The statutory instrument under discussion is important because it relates to the protection of consumers. The idea of annulling the regulations is not only ludicrous in its misinterpretation but undermines confidence in existing protection for consumers. That was borne out by a letter from Sir John Krebs of the Food Standards Agency, who in no uncertain terms made clear the importance of the regulations. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman recognises that it would be a disaster for the regulations to fall, but that did not stop some hon. Members from his party voting for that in the other place.

Lester Firkin, chairman of the Human BSE Foundation, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I suppose the thing I would say is if any Lords voted against this SI, I would invite them to come to our next family day—for people who have lost people through variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (vcjd), which takes place on July 27."</p></blockquote>
The measure is about TSEs and protecting people from the risk of transferring new variant CJD, and has nothing to do with the Animal Health Bill. People's interpretations of these issues are completely wrong, and I shall demolish them one by one. In the meantime, however, I gladly give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Standards Agency guidance openly and transparently. We have explained that there is no evidence of BSE in the national sheep flock, and I am glad that there is not. We are, however, looking for evidence of the disease, rather than being complacent about it, unlike the previous Conservative Administration, whose actions ended in catastrophe for the beef industry. We will not let the sheep industry be affected in the same way. There has not been a drop in sheep meat sales, and the reason for that consumer confidence is that people can make informed judgments when they are given the necessary information. They have confidence in what the FSA says, in what DEFRA says and in the information that we put in the public domain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept that a widespread lack of public confidence has led to concern about the regulations. As a constituency Member of Parliament, I have had no letters whatever about the issue, which is not to say that no one is interested in it. There is, however, a rich seam of paranoia and conspiracy theories on the margins of such issues. Change is also uncomfortable for some people, although that is a separate issue. Some people have an interest in fostering distrust in the Government and in organisations such as the National Farmers Union and the Country Land and Business Association, and I am surprised that the Opposition seem to be following that agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who are concerned about the regulations are in no way representative. DEFRA recently produced its annual report, and is scrutinised by many groups. I would not, of course, expect them all to be completely uncritical, because criticism is a function of a democratic society. Generally speaking, however, the various stakeholders welcome the way in which DEFRA is operating and developing. That certainly seems to be the case from the response to our annual report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should repeat that the regulations have no connection whatever with the Animal Health Bill, and are not a way of bringing it in by the back door. That is simply a misunderstanding, which reflects ignorance of the issue. Incidentally, I make no apology for the Bill, which contains important disease control measures. Some people have an obsession and a fixation with culling, but the Bill is way ahead of them and provides powers in relation to vaccination and the taking of samples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill also deals with important biosecurity issues. We shall have to wait and see what the independent inquiries say about that, although I am sure that it will be interesting. The issue must, however, be dealt with, and the Bill does so. It deals with the minority of farmers who do not follow good biosecurity procedures. Why should the majority be put at risk by the actions of a minority? The Bill also contains powers to prosecute those who deliberately spread infection. We consider that an important issue, but the Opposition obviously do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill was not defeated in the House of Lords, but postponed, and we intend to return with it. It was postponed in the light of the Anderson report, and the House of Lords accepted that. We shall follow the issue up in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
By giving conspiracy theories credence, the Opposition put their credibility, not the Government's, at stake. It was said that people were concerned, but the Opposition seem not to be aware that the regulations were circulated to more than 1,000 groups and interested parties, none of whom raised the sort of concerns being expressed today. That does not suggest a lack of credibility in the Department or the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, it found five typing errors but expressed no concern about a single issue of substance. I apologise for the typing errors. The Committee made one or two helpful suggestions and explained some of the terms, which was perfectly reasonable, but none of that suggests that the regulations are defective or that the Joint Committee had any concerns about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations were circulated for consultation in February, which is when they were put on the website. I cannot be held responsible for people being unable to work out how to look things up on websites. The regulations introduce only three new issues. I shall go through them in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The slaughter powers that the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk queried go back to measures introduced in the 1980s under a Conservative Government: there is nothing new about the slaughter powers in relation to the TSE and BSE regulations. He said that people need to be careful about what they read in the newspapers—and I agree with and underline that point—but there is nothing new except for the three matters that I shall mention in a moment. In another place, an undertaking was given by Lord Whitty on appeals for slaughter. That matter is being considered, and thought is being given to how they might work. That will not be easy in relation to such measures, but the undertaking will be honoured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be no change in the powers of entry from those in the BSE regulations, which were introduced by a Conservative Administration. The definition of livestock in relation to horses, too, is the same as in previous legislation—again, no change. It is used in the regulations only in the context of food controls. There are no TSE-related slaughter powers concerning equines in the regulations, and it is wrong for people to suggest that there are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by reinforcing the point that the legislation is there to protect consumers. It is wrong that a minority should direct discouragement and criticism at regulations that achieve the vital aim of protecting consumers. Such criticism goes against the advice of the Food Standards Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations comply with European and human rights legislation in the normal way. They are important regulations, but they do not introduce mass culling powers through the back door or make the national scrapie plan compulsory. They simply tackle the risks associated with BSE and scrapie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little confused, because I understood that a voluntary scheme had been set up that would remove scrapie over a long period. The Minister's comments suggest that that may not be the case. Will he throw some light on that matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall repeat what I said. The regulations do not make the national scrapie plan compulsory. The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that it is voluntary. The measures for compulsory powers are in the Animal Health Bill, not the regulations, which have nothing to do with the national scrapie plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On TSE-susceptible animals, the regulations underpin the EU regulation, which refers only to TSE-suspect or confirmed animals. The reason why the regulations refer to TSE-susceptible animals is simple: under the European Union legislation that we are implementing, we are required to carry out testing of animals fit for human consumption that have already been sent to the slaughterhouse. We are not culling the animals; they are in the slaughterhouse. Those animals are not TSE-suspect, because they do not exhibit any signs of the disease. The Community regulation requires us for epidemiological purposes to test a proportion of them to see if TSEs are present, which is a sound and sensible precautionary principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We couch our legislation in such terms simply so that it can apply to such animals from susceptible species. The regulations also apply to the offspring of BSE-infected cattle, to prevent them from entering the food chain, because of the risk of maternal transmission. Again, the offspring cull introduced during the previous Administration does not cover TSE suspects, but our legislation has to be able to cover them. In any event, the epidemiological monitoring required of us relates only to certain categories of cattle, sheep and goats. The categories, and in many cases the number of animals involved, are spelled out in the EU legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While it is in my mind, I shall answer the question on pedigree animals. If an animal is covered by TSE regulations for testing but turns out not to have a TSE, the owner will be able to sell the carcase in the normal way. If the animal is positive, compensation will be paid equal to the animal's market value, determined by an independent valuer if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EU regulations, which have been described as draconian, relate to powers in regulations 4 to 10, so that they may be applied only for a
	<br><blockquote><p>"purpose connected with the administration or enforcement of the annual programme of monitoring referred to in Article 6 of the Community TSE Regulation."</p></blockquote>
Accordingly, powers in the regulations cannot be used in relation to cats or even fish for mass culling, as has been alleged, even in another place. The same has been said of the Animal Health Bill. That is paranoia gone mad. Some people say that we are out to get them, but we are not out to get their cat as well, so they can be reassured about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a TSE suspect is discovered on a farm, action is taken only in relation to the affected animal and, in the case of BSE, its offspring. In both cases, full compensation is available to farmers. That is why, throughout the entire BSE story, there has never been the slightest suggestion that farmers are failing to report suspected animals—apart from when there were some concerns about the compensation not being 100 per cent., which was not under this Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Not only can we not slaughter other animals on the farm, but we have made it plain that we see no sense in doing so. Other member states are required under EU legislation to carry out whole herd slaughter when they discover BSE in a herd, or cohort slaughter when BSE is confirmed in an animal. We do not do that in this country because our extremely effective measures, such as the over-30-month scheme, mean that it is not necessary. Incidentally, we do not believe that there is horizontal transmission of BSE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the regulations, we have sought and successfully obtained a formal derogation from the EU Commission. That is because it is recognised that the measures in place here are effective. I would have thought that the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk would have thanked us for the fact that we are taking steps to minimise the number of animals culled and to ensure that they are not culled unnecessarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that Lord Whitty did not allay any suspicions that the regulations reintroduced measures from the Animal Health Bill. I have made it clear that they do not. He has been through that in some detail. Of course, DEFRA consulted widely on the draft TSE proposals weeks before the progress of the Bill was delayed in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no links to the sheep TSE provisions of the Animal Health Bill. The Bill sought to provide for the genotyping of live animals, and to control the breeding of animals on the basis of their genotype, so as to work towards a scrapie-free national flock. That has widespread support from the sheep industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already described the provisions of the regulations relating to the TSE surveillance programme for sheep and goats. Those arrangements affect only animals that are being presented for slaughter anyway, or that die on farm. There is an obligation on Government to act reasonably and proportionately when enforcing legislation. That applies, in this case, in relation to human rights or data protection legislation. The Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, under the remit of which unusual or unexpected use of powers must be reported, has considered the regulations. It reported that there were five typographical errors and raised questions about two minor technicalities, which are being corrected. We can take some reassurance from the fact that it did not find any fault with the powers contained in these regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to emphasises why the powers are needed. The regulations have two clear objectives. First, they represent an opportunity to consolidate the various statutory instruments concerning key domestic controls on BSE and scrapie that have been introduced on an ad hoc basis over several years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the regulations bring the domestic regime in line with recent developments at Community level. It has taken a long time, but the approach to BSE in other member states is becoming far more robust. We have pressed for that for some time, and it is a welcome improvement. Community provisions on TSEs are now to be found in Council regulation 999/2001—adopted last summer—which provides a secure legal base for a tougher EU-wide approach and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
is binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is high time that these measures were in place. While the BSE epidemic continues to decline in this country—in line with the predictions of our scientists and with our eradication programme—that is not the case in other European countries, including France, where more and more cases are coming to light. Our surveillance programmes have been a success, and the Community must now ensure that it faces up to the issues that other member states have realised affect them as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The TSE (England) Regulations 2002 came in on 19 April. I repeat that we have had extensive BSE controls for many years. To a great extent, the controls that have been introduced by the EU mirror the comprehensive legislation that we already had in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is axiomatic that we should wish to hold on to the very stringent controls that have comprised the domestic approach to BSE. Plainly, it is right to use a tried and tested package of proportionate, precautionary measures, founded on expert scientific advice. However, we must not be complacent: it remains absolutely vital for human and animal health that the risks associated with the disease continue to be effectively managed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK controls of the past must be retained: we owe far more to continuity than to any radical new approach. Nevertheless, we have ensured that people have been informed of developments in relation to the new regulations. We consulted the people most likely to be affected, on both the new Community regime and our own proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To promote a proper sense of perspective, let me briefly outline the limited provisions that go beyond the controls that were previously in place in the UK. Two of the issues reflect new EU requirements in regulation 999/2001—one of them flowing from a recommendation by our own advisory body, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee. The first concerns additional EU surveillance requirements for the presence of TSEs in sheep and goats and casualty cattle aged from 24 to 30 months. I appreciate that there are cost implications for abattoirs. That is why DEFRA is meeting all the direct costs of testing and ensuring that results are available to abattoirs within 24 hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will need no reminder of the continuing concerns about TSEs in sheep. A major issue is the uncertainty over the true incidence of scrapie in sheep—that is one of the reasons for the monitoring. Scrapie could mask the presence of BSE. It is a theoretical risk, but not one that we intend to be complacent about, and it is essential to know the full extent of the disease in the Community flock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations also introduce a requirement that the vertebrae of beef assurance scheme cattle, those aged over 30 months, which can be sold for consumption up to 42 months, must now be removed and treated as specified risk material. Bearing in mind the very low BSE risk associated with those cattle, we sought a derogation from the Commission, but it insisted that the provision was
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
necessary, based on the opinion of the EU Scientific Steering Committee, so we accepted what it said on the precautionary principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, incinerators that burn specified risk material must, in future, dispose of the ash by burying it at a licensed landfill site. That is not an EU requirement, but it meets a specific recommendation from SEAC, and by and large it reflects existing industry practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the sum total of meaningful differences introduced by the regulations. The Government are committed to implementing and enforcing them fully because not doing so would have dire consequences and undermine the confidence of consumers. As I have already mentioned, without the regulations, our successful BSE controls would be dealt a hammer blow, inflicting real disease risks on consumers and livestock. That would leave people all over the UK wondering whether we had learned anything from the failures of the past. I sometimes wonder whether the Opposition have learned anything from the failures of the past, both about the precautionary principle and about being open and transparent. In addition, there would be damaging implications for our export markets. We should not forget that the Community provisions set out in Council regulation 999/2001 will apply to all member states. If we did not adopt the Community measures, the UK would face infraction proceedings, which would damage our credibility with the European Commission and in Europe generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That submission was longer than I would usually make to a Committee, but I have dealt with all the points that have been raised. I am sorry that the Opposition have picked up some conspiracy theories, which would be better confined to the more lurid websites on the internet and in the ether. There is not the slightest credibility in any of those allegations, which are based on misunderstanding and malice, and the Opposition are undermined by taking them seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Liberal Democrats—I suspect that this may also be the view held by the official Opposition—have no qualms about trying to eradicate BSE and scrapie from herds and flocks in the UK. In fact, the sooner that is achieved, the better. Most farmers and the rest of the agriculture industry recognise that and will co-operate. I think that the confusion arose, whether by conspiracy or cock-up, largely because of the way in which the Government handled the Animal Health Bill. From Second Reading through the Committee and Report stages, not one dot, comma or word was changed. We tabled a considerable number of amendments in the spirit of reasonableness, trying to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not very fair of the hon. Gentleman, who generally does speak fairly. I introduced the concept of a detailed protocol that would be written into the guidelines given to our divisional veterinary managers in relation to future slaughter, in a way that did not exist under the Animal Health Act 1981. He will also recall that in the final stages of Third Reading, the Opposition raised points that I undertook to take away and consider for debate in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Breed</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that that was said on Third Reading, but we saw little evidence of it happening in the other place. Perhaps because of that background, the Government have been suspected of introducing through the back door some of the provisions that we found obnoxious in the Animal Health Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notwithstanding that, there are clearly significant differences between foot and mouth and TSEs. First, the time scales for dealing with them are different. We recognise that speed was of the essence in the passage of the Animal Health Bill, because we had to stop the spread of the disease. That is not the case with susceptibility to TSEs, because there is enough time for proper notice to be given for inspection of cattle and for appeals and evaluation processes. We would like that to be reflected in the legislation. I have no other real qualms about the methods taken to eradicate BSE and scrapie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem may lie with me rather than with the report, but the 29th report says that regulation 9(2), which is presumably on page 13, begins with the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to paragraph (3) below".</p></blockquote>
I could not see that it said that, in fact, so I am not sure whether there is not an error in the list of errors. That particular point may not make a great deal of difference, but it shows that it may be possible to create a whole series of errors, which would add to the lack of confidence in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 45, on page 33, about the prohibition of the removal of the spinal cord, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No person shall remove the spinal cord or any part of it from the vertebral column of a bovine animal aged six months or more".</p></blockquote>
We accept that, but the French position retains a requirement that it be removed from every animal. Given that the regulations are supposedly EU-compatible, will the Minister explain the situation? We have accepted the period of six months or more, but the French insist that it be removed from every animal, which seems adjacent to their view on banning our beef because of BSE. What discussions have we had with the Standing Veterinary Committee concerning the French stance in that respect?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the over-30-month scheme, which has significantly improved our reduction of BSE cases. It is pleasing that the number of animals with BSE is declining, although the number is not falling as fast as we had hoped it would. It may be flattening a
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
little but, as the Minister says, we should bear in mind the fact that it is rising in other countries. However, is it not time to review the OTMS, as we have gone beyond the time scale for achieving what it was introduced for? It is still very costly and a substantial number of animals are being slaughtered and disposed of that do not need to be. If we could get cross-EU support, so that these regulations and animal health regulations in general could be accepted across the EU, that would do much to help farmers to feel that they are operating on a level playing field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the context of the review, should we not be pressing for a uniform EU system, which would give a practical fillip to beef exports?

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to ask a few questions about the regulations, because I recognise that they do not affect the voluntary removal of scrapie from the national flock. I have some questions that arise from part II(4)(2)(a), which deals with the inspection of TSE-susceptible animals. The measure will give the inspector the right to go in and look for susceptible animals. The Minister is shaking his head, implying that that is not the case, but I have grave concerns because of the situation in my constituency, where scrapie testing has been going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister is aware of my constituent Sue Farquhar of Hansnett farm, who had her whole flock tested for scrapie. The results did not comply with what should have happened according to the breeding of that flock. I recognise that TSE and scrapie are not the same, but I raise this issue because of the potential for masking encephalopathy, which can come from scrapie. The science of scrapie testing, which may be questionable, will be reinforced by the monitoring process. That is a matter of some concern to me, as I hope that the Minister appreciates.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
My other question is whether Krebs, when he reported on the stakeholder inquiry into the potential for BSE in sheep, required this statutory instrument to be introduced. His report seemed to tell people that they could continue to eat sheep, lamb and mutton with impunity, but—I thought that this was rather unhelpful—that the removal of the gut could lead to some risk. As he would not quantify that risk, his remarks might have contributed to a fall in the popularity of lamb and particularly mutton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will address those two concerns. I am sure that he recognises that a statutory instrument of this size looks like a Bill and that people are nervous of seeing the remains of the Animal Health Bill regurgitated. Perhaps that is why rumours have been circulating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the points raised by hon. Members. First, to respond the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall, scrutiny Committees are very important and their views are taken very seriously by the Department and the Government. I am pleased to say that, on occasion, some scrutiny Committees have been very complimentary to DEFRA on our presentation of European regulations through the European Scrutiny Committee and on the way that we have bound and indexed them, making them easy to follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the hon. Gentleman's point about the French insistence on the age of sheep and the spinal columns being removed from those under six months old. We strongly object to that and do not believe that there is any justification for it. There is concern in the French agricultural sector about the proposals and now that a new Government are in place—it has been difficult in the interim period—we will be seeking to clarify those points with the French authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That also applies in relation to the current ban on British beef. We believe that it is heading towards its final stages in relation to the workings of the EU Court. I should emphasise that the French are in breach of Community regulations. That is why the Commission is bringing proceedings against the French Government. It has been quite robust about doing that and I understand that a reasoned opinion is to be issued to the French Government that will give them two weeks to reply. If they do not act on the Court's ruling, there will be further stages that could result in a daily fines to the French Government. We are confident that the Commission will pursue that and we are pressing both the French authorities and the Commission to resolve the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is logical to review the workings of the over-30-month scheme as the number of cases in this country declines. The number is already declining entirely within projections and I am glad to report that the Food Standards Agency, whose opinion we will seek on the matter, is currently conducting such a review. We look forward to its recommendations but there is no doubt that, in due course, we will be able to relax those regulations as BSE cases fall. We very much welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
The hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Wiggin) asked a number of questions about the statutory instrument, which is primarily concerned with BSE in cattle and scrapie in sheep, which is a TSE. It is not the vehicle for addressing any finding of BSE in sheep. He will be aware that we published a detailed contingency plan on what the Government would do if BSE were ever found in the national flock. I should stress that we would not necessarily slaughter the lot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have started putting contingency plans into the public domain, which the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would never have done in years gone by. In doing so, we are following the guidance of the Phillips report that we should prepare for worst-case scenarios, that we should trust people's judgment and be open and transparent. So we do that—we hold a press conference and explain to the press exactly what the plan means and of course the headlines read, "National flock to be slaughtered." That is a bit depressing, because the contingency plans step up the response according to detailed and sophisticated risk analysis in different scenarios.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's comments about scrapie testing as part of the monitoring programme exhibit some confusion. It is dealt with in the EU regulation relating to an examiner looking at sheep's brains for TSEs, which is designed to give us an idea of the scale of TSEs in the national flock. Genotyping comes under the national scrapie plan, which is completely separate from these regulations. The plan is up and running and we said in our consultation on it that at some stage it would have to be compulsory. There would be no point in having such a plan and 90 per cent, of the sheep industry getting involved in it if there were still an element of scrapie in the national flock, because we would lose all the benefits of a scrapie-free flock. We shall probably have to make the plan compulsory at some point, but we are talking with the sheep industry about what would be a reasonable time scale for an eradication programme. The industry is working closely with us, and we are happy with its cooperation and support and with the progress that we are making.

As I have said, I very much regret the blood-testing problems experienced by the constituents of the hon. Member for Leominster. All that I can say—it is not much by way of mitigation—is that those problems arose at the beginning of the blood-testing programme. There were faults in the laboratory, and one of the automated systems failed. That problem has been rectified, and the hon. Gentleman will be aware that we have had no further blood-testing errors even though the scheme has expanded greatly since his constituents participated in it. I am pleased about that, and I apologise for the problems that his constituents had.

I appreciate that the Food Standards Agency made a recommendation on sausage skins, which are made from sheep's intestines. The whole idea is that the FSA should be an independent body and say things that the Government might occasionally find uncomfortable; that is what an independent agency is all about. The FSA consults the industry, and has independent staff to give advice. We are entitled to question its

recommendations and to ask it to explain them, but we must take them seriously, and we do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting small debate on the issue, and I am grateful for Opposition Members' contributions. I felt, however, that the Minister was a tiny bit sensitive. During my days of teaching young staff officers at the staff college in Camberley, it was invariably those who were arguing a shaky case who went in for bluster. I am sure, however, that the Minister feels passionately about this subject, because he rarely denigrates other hon. Members in such debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at the start, we sought this debate because of legitimate concerns. I said that I fully accepted that several of the points raised in the media were not necessarily true, and that I did not particularly agree with some of the points made in the other place. However, other specific questions were raised, and it is right and proper, and part of the parliamentary process, that we tease them out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question but that the Conservative Opposition were going to vote down a piece of legislation that would have left the British consumer and British farming in an appalling state. The Government got themselves into that problem, and many hon. Members, including some Labour Members, realise that the Government sometimes spin themselves out of control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the next 48 hours, the Minister should read the verbatim minutes of the exchange with the permanent secretary. He will see that the reliability of the Department's annual report has been well and
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
truly shredded and that many factual errors were discovered. However, that is not the main issue today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for answering several of our questions. The legislation that we are discussing is important, not only because we are required to implement it by the European Commission, but because we must retain the confidence of the farming community, of people interested in animal welfare and of consumers.

The Minister may sometimes get irritated because he has to deal with suggestions that are weird and mad, as he so graphically described the one that I mentioned from the British Veterinary Association. I am sure that its representatives will look forward to having a frank exchange of views with him in the next few months. It is one of the duties of the Opposition and of Back Benchers, as we saw during the Animal Health Bill, to raise legitimate concerns. He may have laid to rest some concerns, but in the best spirit of constructive opposition, I urge the Minister, who I know tries hard in this respect, to make certain that the information that is provided is as accurate as possible. I fully understand that, in the interests of transparency, his Department has made public all sorts of contingency plans. I agree that there is a risk in that, but I welcome it, because responsibility ultimately lies with the Government. To conclude, I welcome this debate and his response, and I thank my colleagues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
