	<p>Amendment proposed [28 June], No. 3 in page 2, line 2 after "concerned", to
	<br><blockquote><p>"if they have undertaken consultation with parents and teachers of children attending secondary and primary schools in the area." [
	<i>Mr. Kinnock.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are discussing at the same time amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 2, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) In making an application under subsection (3) above the local education authority, managers or governors concerned, shall inform the Secretary of State of the consultation they have had locally with parents of children in the schools involved, with parents whose children are now in primary schools in the area, and likely to attend the secondary schools involved with members of the teaching profession in the schools involved, and in local primary schools, and with local community interest."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At our last sitting I was trying to develop the argument about the need for the widest possible consultation regarding any changes, that the different groups needed to be consulted and that there should be different weighting. But as we have printed copies of our last proceedings there is no need for me to recap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had started to argue the need for consultation regarding pupil-teacher ratios. One of the most disturbing features of the old system of secondary modern schools and grammar schools was the disproportionate allocation of resources. More money was given to the grammar schools and they were able to enjoy a better pupil-teacher ratio than secondary modern schools. In going back on those proposals, it is important that the local authority makes it clear to parents that it does not intend to discriminate against either type of school, that in a secondary modern
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
School system pupils will enjoy the same pupil-teacher ratios.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the allocation of resources for books people have been disturbed that local authorities have either reduced or not increased the amount allocated in line with inflation. We hear of pupils with insufficient text books who either have to share or use photocopied pages from text books, which is unsatisfactory. It seems, from my researches, that the situation is worse in the secondary modern schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities should state that they are not trying to make the secondary moderns second-class Schools and give a clear commitment that, in the allocation of resources, they will give as much to the second modern as to the grammar schools. It may well be that the number of text books needed in the secondary modern schools is not as great as the need for other materials—such as audio-visual aids, which are expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should also be more information about truancy rates. Conservatives have criticised the truancy level in some comprehensive and secondary modern schools. But there are often remarkably high truancy rates in some grammar schools. That is because one or two people are playing truant. Considering the selective nature of the intake, no one should play truant from such a school. Parents should be assured that pupils selected for grammar schools, who find the education offered not to their liking, will be able to transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a transfer may imply demotion and a loss of status there is a tendency for pupils not to transfer, although it would be in their best educational interest to develop a more widely based course; the type of education available in a comprehensive school but not in a selective school. The question of transfer downwards should be discussed fully. In a transfer upwards, it is implied that the pupil has done very well, but in the transfer downwards there is a problem and the child's reaction may be to truant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point concerns one of the more crucial areas—namely, the proportion of children who will be selected for grammar schools. Very few local authorities actually spell this out. The method tends to depend on how many places are available. The grammar school has a three-stream entry, so 90 children can attend the grammar school, and if that represents 20 per cent., 25 per cent. or 30 per cent. of the number of children in that year, that is the pro-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
portion which goes. We therefore have the very unfair situation in which in one year a child is selected for a grammar school while, perhaps, two or three years later a child of exactly the same ability does not get selected because there happen to be more children in that age group. The proportions of children to go to grammar school and to secondary modern school ought to be spelled. out. However, one of the major weaknesses of the selective system is that no one can Say, whether the ideal proportion should be 20 per cent., 35 per cent. or any figure between them. I think that this area should be fully discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further point that should be discussed in consultation concerns the real questioning of examination results. The Government are very pleased to question some of the results in the newer comprehensive schools, but what surprises me is that they are not so willing to question the results that have emerged in some of the grammar schools and often in some of the independent schools or former direct grant schools. Some hon. Members boast about examination results of 90 per cent., 95 per cent. and sometimes higher percentages, but the real question is, why was the figure not 100 per cent?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the school has a selective intake and if the selection process is correct, all its pupils should be reaching O-level and a large proportion should achieve successful A-level results. It is a matter of comparing examination results not with other schools but with the predicted ability of the children who attend that school. If a school maintains, as some of the independent schools did, that it had the top 5 per cent. from a particular catchment area, then the real measure of that school is whether any child failed to achieve satisfactory examination results; it should be said not that the school has done well because 85 per cent. of the pupils passed but rather that it had done badly because of the I5 per cent. failure rate. There should be far more discussion of a school's examination results in the context of the likely achievement of the children who attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I argue that there should be far more consultation in that respect, and I hope that the Government will accept either amendment No. 3 or my amendment No. 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that the Government could easily accept the two amendments, because they have made almost a fetish—at least in theory—or consultation. However, there are one or two points which I find rather obscure in the clause. Subsection (3) states
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where any proposals to which this subsection applies have been approved under subsection (4) of section 13, the Secretary of State may, on the application of the local education authority, managers or governors concerned, revoke the approval."</p></blockquote>
I assume that, the approval having been granted, action may have been taken under the 1976 Act. I should like the Minister to make it clear whether this means that approval has been given but no action has been taken, or whether the approval has now been put into a concrete reality and implies the unscrambling of a comprehensive set-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, does it mean that the 11-plus, having been aboloished so that children do not now have to face this narrow-minded ritual, will again have to be faced? Does it mean, in any way, the unscrambling of a new system, or does it exist, merely in theory, because of approval? It could imply an all-out assault on comprehensive education and not, as was conveyed on Second Reading, a factor affecting just those who are in the last 10 per cent. or 20 per cent. Therefore I wonder whether, as I assume, it is an encouragement to all Tory councils that have become or are becoming comprehensive to go back to what we recognise as elitism. I should like the Minister to clear up these problems for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3 seeks to add the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"if they have undertaken consultation with parents and teachers of children attending secondary and primary schools in the area."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) has given a detailed explanation and has delineated the problem with his usual precision. We had many debates in 1976 and particularly on the previous Bill, in which parental choice was stated to be fundamental. Presumably it will be in the Bill that is to come in the autumn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought, therefore, after the endless homilies that we have heard on parental choice and consultation—especially from the Minister himself—that both amendments could have been drafted by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
him. I remember his lengthy contributions to debate, strung out far beyond the point at which they were finished. Throughout that time the implied demand was for more democracy, more consultation—in particular, consultation with parents. Slogans were trotted out about parents having a right to know and to understand until the phrase "the parents" was being endlessly intoned like an incantation on a prayer wheel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of all that, I should have thought that the amendments were flesh of the Minister's flesh and bone of his bone. I should have thought that he would have welcomed them. We have heard him waxing endlessly lyrical on this theme. As I said before on one occasion, it could almost have been set to music.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also trotted out was the parents' charter. It was not, however, the kind of parents' charter at whose shrine the Opposition would wish to worship. We are still wondering how much reality there is in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard talk about freedom and compulsion. Most laws have an element of compulsion in them. Section 7 of the 1944 Act says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The statutory system of public education shall be organised in three progressive stages"</p></blockquote>
and so on. We have been accused of compulsion as though there were not implicit in almost every law a high degree of compulsion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an oft-quoted statement of the Minister that people in the area know what is best for the schooling in the area. That is, in fact, absolute nonsense. It is lovely demagogic stuff, but if one can accept the sincerity of the hon. Gentlemen opposite, and if they really mean that the people in the area know what is best for the schooling in the area, one would think that they would embrace the amendments and would want to consult and to go into every detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stockport, North has delineated all the details of the state of education—the numbers in classes, the availability of books, the records in the grammar schools and so on. If, therefore, it is true, and if hon. Gentlemen opposite believe, that the people in the area know what is best, it would be interesting to see them consult the people in an area before they consign the children of that area back into the secondary modern schools, with all that that implies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
I found another aspect intriguing. The hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Greenway) said that there should be no consultation with teachers; that it would be a waste of time and surplus to necessity. I am sure that Conservative Members, who quoted on the previous Education Bill practically every source from which quotations could be dragged out, know that for many years the National Union of Teachers has been in favour of comprehensive education. When I hear people saying that most teachers are not in favour, I am reminded of those people who say that we must not listen to the national results of democratic conferences and who say that we must have the ear of the people, as though the people have, in some way, a national conference and that only certain people understand what "the people" are thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The teachers, at every conference at which I have been present over many years, are on record solidly and determinedly against the Bill, and in favour of comprehensive education. Of course there are some teachers who may not be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Greenway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I refer the hon. Gentleman to what I said on our first sitting:
	<br><blockquote><p>"First, parents are voters. Secondly, to bring in teachers as a second line of consultation seems unnecessary. Teachers are on almost every governing body of schools in the country. They are already thoroughly consulted there."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> Standing Committee A. 28 June 1979; c. 48]</p></blockquote>
I developed that argument by pointing out that teachers are already consulted primarily on governing and managing bodies. They are also consulted on local education authorities in every possible way. The amendment would involve a duplication of that consultation, which I regard as unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the point I made, which may have been misunderstood, and which I wish to make absolutely clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman means precisely what he says, but the teachers do not agree with that. Indeed, the teachers are watching this debate with great care and have their representatives here now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
The reality is that the teachers want consultation. They want the parents to be consulted. They know—they have it on record in their journals—that this Bill is a withdrawal from progressive steps in education. The 1944 Act uses the words "progressive developments" over and over again. The Government intend to go back. They are not progressive but reactionary and retrograde. The Government want to step back to something which has virtually disappeared. Hon. Gentlemen know that. [
	<i>Laughter.</i>] It is no good hon. Gentlemen laughing, as the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) always does when he is caught out, because it covers up nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am laughing at the hon. Member: the funniest thing since Groucho Marx.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: is the hon. Gentleman seeking to intervene? if so, he must get the permission of the hon. Member who has the Floor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be delighted to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: is the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Mr. Flannery) giving way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment, Miss Fookes, I will allow the hon. Gentleman to intervene. The fact is that it is not only the National Union of Teachers, and the National Association of Schoolmasters/ Union of Women Teachers which, have fundamentally, the same viewpoint. So do many other associations. For instance, NATFHE has the same viewpoint. Therefore, the bulk of teachers, in democratic conference, are totally opposed to the Bill, which they see as retrograde. The Opposition seek to ensure that they are consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member appears on all occasions to suggest that he represents all teachers in putting forward such views. I am not denying that teachers' conferences have decided, on majority votes, in favour of comprehensive education. But conferences do not speak for all teachers. Is the hon. Gentleman aware that there is a sizeable body of opinion within the teaching profession which is Very concerned about
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
comprehensive education and which does not believe that comprehensive education should have a monopoly of the secondary sector? Those teachers are also concerned about the increase in truancy which has resulted from the implementation of comprehensive education in many areas, particularly inner city areas, and the way that the implementation of re-organisation in inner city areas has robbed many young people of the opportunity to have the advantage of a selective education, consequently creating considerable juvenile problems in this country. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will give credit to some teachers that they do not necessarily go all the way with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has merely reiterated, but with more vigour and at greater length, what I said. I said that the teachers' organisations and their journals were on record as opposing the Bill and believing in comprehensive education. I then went on to say—it is a pity that I have to repeat it, because most people know that I said it—that of course there were teachers who were opposed. In 1870, there were people who were opposed to the building of schools and of children going to them at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We often find ourselves in a minority of opposition but we must take this into account when major organisations want consultation, and are on record as opposing an important measure. Small as the Bill is, it is a massive measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Greenway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether it is possible to show me any point on which the AMMA, which has 85,000 members, opposes the Bill? Secondly, it is not clear from the way that my previous point was not really answered by the hon. Gentleman that he is asking for a triple consultation with teachers? What is fair about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Greenway) and I will not agree on the matter. Of course there are some small teachers' organisations that disagree with my view. I am saying that most teachers' organisations and, in my opinion, the vast body of individual teachers who elect their leaders through the democratic process, are on record—and have been for many years—as being for comprehensive education. I was a teacher, as I believe that the hon. Gentleman was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
I know that the hon. Gentleman holds his viewpoint honourably; I know also that the hon. Member for Macclesfield does, although he hammers away at it so relentlessly and vigorously that he often causes unnecessary opposition by his approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not speak at length. We are asking in the two amendments for what the Conservative Party in these Committee rooms in our debates of 1976, and those which we had for two or three months before the Recess and before the new Parliament endlessly demanded—consultation with parents. We are not now merely acceding to that request, because we have always wanted consultation with parents and have always done that. We have done everything in our power and now we want them to carry out their promises and accept the two amendments, because they have said—year in and year out, day in and day out—that they want consultation with parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science (Dr. Rhodes Boyson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good, pleasant and cheerful debate on the two amendments to clause 1(3). I was interested when the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) referred back to the similar, and almost historic, debate that we had in 1976 in one of the Committee rooms, and recalled the donkey's tail efforts on that occasion. That point was also taken up by the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between the two sides of the Committee is that we believe that people's eyes should be opened so that they can put the donkey's tail where it fits, whereas the Opposition believe that only a mandarin can put the tail in the right place. People's eyes should be opened, and I am very grateful to the hon. Member for Lewisham, West for bringing out attention to this parable—of the donkey's tail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also interested in the sudden conversion of hon. Members opposite to the idea of consultation with parents and teachers. We have seen instances earlier, to which I referred in our last debate, of possible differences once a party goes into opposition. It cleanses the mind and leads to a reconsideration. I welcome the Viewpoints put forward by hon. Members opposite, not just this morning but also last Thursday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Eastham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take up this
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
point? The Minister always seems to be making an inference that there is no consultation by local authorities if they are Labour-controlled. However, taking the example of the city of Manchester, I can give a categorical assurance that whenever there have been proposals to introduce any sort of alterations, much time has been given, many public meetings have been held and a great number of consultations have taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Roman Catholic schools reorganisation took place there were many public meetings. I have chaired meetings at which there have been consultations in great depth to explain to parents and consult parents, after which we have sieved their comments and observations. It is not true to keep on saying that we do not believe in consultation, because I can give facts, figures, dates and accounts of the occasions when we have gone through precisely that type of procedure. I hope, therefore, that the Gentleman will not say that again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the intervention of the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Mr. Eastham), and I hope that he can influence his hon. Friends, because in previous debates here there has been little mention of consultation. It may interest the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley to know, the hon. Member for Bedwellty having referred to the Conservative manifesto—now, clearly, compulsory reading for Opposition Members, a matter that we on this side welcome—that I took home this weekend, by sheer accident, something called "The Labour way is the better way ". It is, apparently, the Labour Party manifesto for 1979. I thought I would have a look to see what it said about consultation with parents and teachers, because Opposition Members now clearly have a view on the matter. I hope that Opposition Members will check that I am right here, because I should hate to make a statement in this Committee that was wrong, factually or in any other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from one reference by the Leader of the Opposition, in his introduction, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Parents and teachers will have a greater freedom to influence the running of their children's schools"—</p></blockquote>
there was no mention of choice of schools, incidentally, only of running their children's schools—nothing was said about consultation with parents and teachers. So
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
I thought it would be dealt with in the manifesto itself. I read the whole manifesto, but parents were mentioned only twice, and both references were to one-parent families. That is the only mention of parents in the whole manifesto. One could say, as Christie Davis who, I believe, is also a Welshman said yesterday—that it is under-doggery, that the one-parent family is mentioned but that normal parents are not mentioned anywhere in the manifesto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find that very interesting. I have always welcomed deathbed repentances. It is a bit late now for Opposition Members, but we on this side have always been anxious to have consultation, and we welcome the fact that the Labour Party now agrees with us on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me say what the clause does. Its main purpose is the revocation of approval of proposals which have not been implemented. That is the intention. If any of those areas or voluntary schools want to revoke the proposals that have been put forward, it is only because the proposals were put forward under duress by the previous Government. It is not because they are changing their minds on consultation. It is because they consulted locally, decided what should be done, only to find that the Government disagreed with them. The compulsory comprehensive Act of 1976 was dragged out at that stage. The very reason that we do not need to have consultations now is that those consultations took place but they were ignored by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment were accepted, the result would be a delaying operation in areas which want to return to genuine consultation, which they have already had, and any delay would mean that schemes which were disliked in that area would have to be implemented. So we might as well be clear as to what the result of the amendment would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing to stop areas consulting again if they want to do so. There is no mention at all in the 1976 Act of consultation with parents and teachers. I am glad that these amendments have been tabled. If ever this country were so ill-advised as to have another Labour Government, the fact that this debate this morning has taken place will be one saving grace that we shall certainly bring out, wherever we may sit at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1976 Act—many of us on this
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
side of the Committee sat through the Committee stage of that legislation—there is no mention of consultations with parents and teachers before the proposals are put into operation. The very fact that that view is now held by Opposition Members is something that we welcome, but it is a bit late in the day for the implementation of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested, too, in what the hon. Member for Bedwellty said, very fairly, about the 30 per cent. vote in the north of Kingston upon Thames and the apparent desire in that area to go for some form of comprehensivisation. The hon. Member belongs to that area and obviously knows what happened. I wonder if this represents another move in the view of the Labour Party, and that Labour Members will now say that if parents and teachers in any area vote to keep their schools one way or to change it then, that will be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar reference was made by the hon. Member to the voice of the people. How to define the voice of the people would make a good debate in the Oxford or Cambridge Union, where the hon. Member and I have met before. But if the voice of the people is to be the local vote, it can work both ways. If this is now to be the Labour Party view—I should like it clarified at some stage, not necessarily today, but after secret or open conclaves, or whatever happens—we shall need to respond to it. If the new view is that if people in an area vote one way we should follow that vote, certainly we on this side shall have to go back and think about our attitude. Areas such as Southend voted the other way. The hon. Member for Bedwellty is a complete democrat—I do not have the slightest doubt about that—and I am sure that, similarly, he will be delighted that the will of the people in Southend is being carried out because the people of that area voted to retain their grammar schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If there is a plan to change a school it will affect the children who are there because it will affect the staffing of that school and the movement of staff in and out, which is something we have seen. But I take on board what was said by the hon. Member for Stockport, North. It seems to me that we are moving into new territory here. If, following the lead given by his hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty, local consultation is to be so important then obviously consultation should be had with the parents of children likely to be going into a particular schools entirely agree with the hon. Member for Stockport, North on this point. On agreement, I would add that I entirely agree with him that the same age group of children, the same money should be spent whether they be in secondary modern or grammar schools. I have put in the question of the age group because of the higher expense involved with sixth formers, particularly those doing technical work. This is not a let-out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the Minister agree that any compensation for the sixth form should be taken into the provisions for, say, remedial classes in secondary modern schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am going only so far and I will not be pushed by the hon. Gentleman, who is very persistent in his cross-examination of me and very wise in many of his comments. I believe that the simplest way—I think that administration should be simple—is that which came into being in Lancashire when I was a secondary modern school head there. I may say that this followed upon a great battle in that area, but the decision was that the same age
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
group should be given the same allowances. However, I do not wish to depart further from the main theme of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to comment on a few points raised by the hon. Member for Bedwellty. On the question of Kingston upon Thames, Clause 1(3) does not apply to that area at all because no proposals have come from Kingston upon Thames. Nor does it apply to Erith because no comments can be made or decisions taken regarding that area unless it puts up a section 13 notice or makes suggestions concerning changing the schooling in the Erith area. Neither Kingston upon Thames nor Erith is affected by the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the Minister's debating technique but the reason I introduced those two cases, as I am sure he will recognise, was to try to establish how seriously the Conservative party, in government, would take the principle of consultation with parents. The Minister has made it apparent this morning that he will not take this principle very seriously at all—despite everything that was said in the Tory manifesto. That satisfies my curiosity at least, if not my aspiration for parental consultation. If the Minister will treat those two cases as examples to demonstrate his belief in consultation—which has apparently been asserted before the Bill was introduced—he will be giving a fair reckoning to what I said last Thursday. If he does not do that, the whole purpose of the debate will have been significantly undermined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking to clause 1(3) and the amendment thereto. Regarding the two cases mentioned by the hon. Member for Bedwellty—on Kingston upon Thames, a Government cannot pass any opinion until proposals have been given to them. No proposals have come to the Government from Kingston upon Thames; similarly, no proposals have come from Bexley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which section I3 works is that its proposals are posted for two months so that parents can object. When the proposals from that area come to the Secretary of State he must bear in mind the objections made to those proposals. This means that consultation must go on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely on this clause we are talking about people who were making proposals under the section
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
and who are now considering withdrawing them. Is the Under-Secretary giving us an undertaking that those authorities will now advertise the reverse procedure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Member for Stockport, North. I do not suppose that he will be surprised to be disappointed. The answer is no—a straight forward two-letter word. There have already been conversations in those areas—there had to be before proposals were made to the Government. In any case, those areas did not want to go comprehensive: in most cases people in those areas indicated that they did not want to go comprehensive. There has been consultation. Acceptance of the amendment would mean that those authorities had to implement schemes which they did not want. That seems the ultimate nonsense of a non-consultative system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that, once I have pointed that out, the hon. Member for Stockport, North will be as glad as I am that we are not prepared to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to get this straight. The Under-Secretary said that this does not apply to Erith and Kingston. Can he give the Committee the list of authorities to which, potentially, the clause applies? On reflection, he will agree that his statement that in every case this applies to authorities which did not want to go comprehensive may not be true. There may be authorities which consulted and had their section 13 proposals approved and which have now been taken over by the opposite party, so that when the consultation took place with the parents that consultation was on one set of proposals; but now the Minister is saying that local authorities can switch to a completely different set of proposals without any consultation at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: An authority cannot switch to a completely different set of proposals. It can only withdraw its existing proposals and then start again. It is quite clear. No area can be landed with schemes it does not want. That contrasts with the previous Government who landed all areas with schemes which they did not want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a ray of freedom—I am sorry that it is no more than a ray of freedom. The comment of the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) is therefore
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
inapplicable. These areas put up their schemes only under duress with a gun in their back. The gun has now been removed. That means, "Would you like to be free again?" That is all that this scheme does. I know that it hurts the party opposite to let people be free again, but it will have to get over that and I hope it will not be too upset as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hypnotising, almost. The hon. Gentleman will recognise that in whatever circumstances the proposal to move to comprehensive reorganisation is made it is an important step: whether it takes place spontaneously, or whether it comes partially or wholly as a result of the 1976 Act, it is substantial. Would the Minister not also recognise that, after that whole procedure has been under way—in some cases for up to almost two years—the act of revocation without further consultation is also substantial? But the act of revocation with the endorsement after consultation with the parents concerned would at least be defensible on popular democratic grounds, even if it were not defensible on political grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very good case. At one stage I thought the hon. Member for Bedwellty almost believed it. Undoubtedly the repeal of the Bill will cause concern. It is likely to cause open-air dancing or morris dancing in the streets. That is why it is important to get it through while the weather is good, so that those celebrations because people are free again can be held in the open air.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I take the hon. Member's point further? If those areas want to put a new proposal forward at any time, they can do so. Nobody is taking away their right to make proposals or to consult. We are taking away the compulsion to reorganise in a way that they did not want. That is all that the clause seeks to do.

education means that we have moved from Fabian mandarism to some form of populism, we are in for an interesting time. I shall be very interested to see how that will affect the rest of educational policy. But, if the conversion—almost a deathbed conversion of the Labour Party, none of which was put in the 1976 Act or the Manifesto—to full consultation with parents and teachers is to remain, this country will be a rather better place educationally than it was before.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is unique treatment of a Committee. The Minister has some information there. Other hon. Members want to speak to this amendment.

I suggest that they avoid them during the time of the celebrations of the revocation of the Bill.

We must not spend too long on this particular matter, though I sec that it arouses great excitement on both sides of the Committee. We welcome that. I think that the hon. Member for Bedwellty will welcome any enlivening of the educational scene, of which we have every sign this morning. However, I conclude by saying that all that the clause does is to allow areas that were under duress to apply to withdraw their proposals. If alternative proposals are desired, they will go through normal consultations, and a section 13 notice will come out. If we accepted the amendment, it would mean that areas would have to put through a scheme in which they did not believe, and it would be too late to go back. I ask my hon. Friends to reject the amendment and to keep the Bill as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Miss Joan Maynard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One would imagine that this was a debate about freedom of choice, but we on this side realise that it is about freedom of choice for a very small minority of people. We do not fear consultation with parents and teachers, because the majority of parents and teachers support the present system. In any case, as democrats, we appreciate that we can go only as far as we can carry people with us.. We, therefore, do not object to any consultation with parents and teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in the comments of the Minister about the law putting people "under duress". I take it that he means that the law is .a form of duress when it does things that he does not like. Normally
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
he and his party are great law and order people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said last Thursday: "Local people know best". He ought, therefore, to support these amendments,. for they refer not just to local people, but to the local people most directly concerned, namely the parents and teachers in primary and secondary schools, who are particularly concerned with the Bill. However, hon. Members opposite seem to have split personalities or schizophrenia on the question of freedom. It certainly does not apply when it comes to local authorities having freedom of choice in respect of council houses. They are interested in freedom of choice only when it relates to a group of people to whom they want to give freedom of choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the Bill will be traumatic on both primary schools and secondary schools. It will stop experiment and new ideas. That is not to say that all new ideas and experiments are good. Nevertheless, many good results have come out of the new experiments and ideas that have been tried, which have been possible only because we have got away from the 11-plus selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the Bill, those results will go out of the window and everything will once again be geared to the narrow restrictive concept of getting children through the 11-plus examination. It will encourage competition rather than co-operation, and it is the children from middle-class homes who will be better able to compete. I believe that competing very often brings out the worst in people rather than the best. It brings out the philosophy of "I'm all right, Jack" and never mind what happens to the rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also told that we must pursue excellence. Excellence for whom? There is positive proof that under the comprehensive system more children have achieved excellence than ever did under the old grammar school system, but this Bill will give opportunities to some children to pursue excellence at the expense of others—really, at the expense of the majority of children. Much more excellent educational results have been obtained in the comprehensive system than were ever obtained under the old grammar school system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The majority of parents do not want to
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
return to selection at 11-plus. The teachers do not want to go back to the old restrictive curricula that used to apply in primary schools as are suit of having to gear them to the 1I-plus selection, and they do not want to go back to all the agonising concerned with selection. I am confident that, if parents and teachers are properly consulted, they will reject a return to the old grammar school and 11-plus system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the amendments will be accepted and that there will be real consultation with the parents and teachers of children directly involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Then he told us that he had a list, and the list was thrust at him by his officials at one side. Then he said that, although he now had a list, we could not have it and that he would not read it out until after the debate on the clause, which is shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.

It is necessary to have the list so that the Minister can substantiate the statement that he made, which was that every local education authority which might apply to revoke under the subsection would be one that had had the 1976 Act used against it, contrary to its will. My hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) gave me the answer that he received on Monday to a parliamentary question, which contains the list in it, but also a great deal more than that. He
	<br><blockquote><p>"asked the Secretary of State for Education and Science, pursuant to his statement on page 99 of the draft 
	<i>Official Report</i> of 19 June, which schools will become comprehensive this coming autumn."</p></blockquote>
In the answer, he was given a very full list. I shall not read it all but it starts with St. Mary's Roman Catholic Grammar School for Boys in Bexley, through Hounslow, Liverpool, Macclesfield, Congleton, Selby, Retford, Tamworth, Hove, Ross-on-Wye, Framlingham, Wolverhampton, Deane Grammar School, Bolton, Bury and Oswestry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is where one used to change, I believe, but I am not sure that the station still exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a list of all local authorities which propose to go comprehensive, either willingly or subject to section 76 procedures. However, it is not necessarily a list of those authorities to which the provisions of section 76 have applied, because some will have been going comprehensive quite willingly. There may be authorities which were not going to go comprehensive but which willingly accepted the provisions of section 76. It is untrue to say, as the Minister pretended, that all authorities which underwent the section 76 procedures of sending in development plans and having them treated under the provisions as though they were section 13 proposals, did so unwillingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Conservative authorities had said firmly, "We do not want to go comprehensive, but if the law says we must we will obey the law." They accepted all the
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
Conservative Party. Many of those authorities, during consultations with progressive Conservatives—such as the hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee), who it is so sad to see on the Back Benches in this debate; we should like to hear from him before our debate has ended—with reactionary Conservatives and with parents and teachers, were convinced, and willingly put in the proposals under section 76.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point might conflict with what the Minister said. Many of the consultations, although not all of them, which went on with parents statutorily under the 1976 Act in some of the local authorities mentioned in the list, proceeded on the assumption among parents and by the local education authority concerned that they were going comprehensive, that they wanted to go comprehensive and that the parents were putting in proposals to change one sort of comprehensive school to another sort of comprehensive school; they were not conducted in any way at all in, as it were, either the 11-plus or comprehensive school atmosphere. Those consultations, statutorily under the law, went forward with parents, teachers and other members of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change that took place in some of these authorities had nothing to do with the 1976 Act. It was because the Conservatives, in some cases a particularly reactionary brand of Conservative—not, unhappily for the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) in Cheshire where I know he feels his brand of Conservatism in county hall is far too liberal for the good folk of Macclesfield, Congleton, and such places—who took over in May of this year may, contrary to their predecessors, dislike those schemes which have gone through under full consultative procedures and which would have been expected to go through, under the law, in September this year with no I1-plus at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told by the hon. Gentleman that although consultations took place in a co-operative and benign spirit with everybody in the community—parents, teachers, Schoolmasters; all appointed to posts next term, with heads of department appointed, and youngsters already allocated to schools—if a reactionary gang happened to take over the education authority in May this year, it should have the right, in a month or two and with all the disruption seen at Tameside, to cancel those appointments, to resurrect ridiculous summer holiday
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
11-plus examinations, to use schools for purposes for which they had not been designed, and to waste public money in that way without consulting parents, teachers, and so on, within the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the Minister suggests should be allowed to take place—the Minister who kept us morning after morning, afternoon after afternoon, and evening after evening, prating hour upon hour about how the Labour Government were not consulting parents and teachers sufficiently. I have never come across such a load of humbug as this clause. There is no more vital amendment—now I see the way in which the clause might be used by certain education authorities—than the amendment now before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I had hoped that this list might have come as miraculously to me, Miss Fookes, as it floated over from your table to the Minister. But, alas, it seems to have become stuck in some sort of Xerox machine and has not arrived. I should like to compare this list—in the parliamentary question answered on Monday—with the Minister's list. Because of the way in which this debate is proceeding, 'and the absolute arrogance shown, I invite the Minister again to read the list. It would not take Very long. It we could have the list it would enable this debate to proceed with reasonable expedition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
After Bury comes Cumbria, for next year; Cockermouth, for 1981; Kendal, in 1980—Cumbria is an authority heavily affected by the clause; Essex, 1980; Hampshire, this year; Kent, next year for implementation; in Salop it will be Oswestry this year and Shrewsbury for 1981; Staffordshire; Trafford; Wirral; Wolverhampton and Tameside Catholic schools; All those would be affected by the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's late conversion to open government. Had he decided to read the list in the first place, it could have saved the need for some of my earlier remarks. Clearly, one would have to do a certain amount of work on the list and analyse the composition and the mentality of the various Conservative—in every case, except Tameside and Wolverhampton—local education authorities concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the list is very significant. The Minister was very courteous in circulating the Notes on Clauses. I recognise the style. I remember that such details were supplied in 1976. I believe that that was the first time in an education Committee that such details were supplied to all members of the Committee. But the information sent to us before this Committee was inadequate. When we have the new Bill, appendices such as this, which gives the list of schools affected, should be included with the preliminary information. That would save all the time we have had to spend digging
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
the list out of the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one specific question. I consider subsection (3) to be completely uncertain. The note on subsection (3) says—and this is why we must have some consultation—that
	<br><blockquote><p>"where such proposals have been approved under Subsection (4) of Section 13"</p></blockquote>
—and this is the list of ones that have been—
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the Secretary of State may, on the application of the local education authority, managers or governors … concerned, revoke the approval."</p></blockquote>
In Tameside, for instance, the local education authority is quite unlikely to ask for revocation, because a Labour local education authority has now been elected in Tameside. I suspect that the Roman Catholic hierarchy is unlikely to ask for revocation, because it has shown a greater adherence to the principles of comprehensive democratic education in this country than have the Conservative Party and many other bodies—certain Labour groups, even—over the past 20 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the clause mean that, if there were a palace revolution in Manchester Cathedral and managers and governors of the Roman Catholic schools suddenly decided that they wanted to apply for revocation, they would be allowed to achieve revocation notwithstanding the views of the local education authority? The clause does not say "and" or "or". There is just a comma. I am sufficiently a child at drafting to know what that means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister feels like intervening to answer that point, I should be interested; I see little notes being written for him. It particularly concerns me, and it might apply to some of the other schools in this list. Let us take Wolverhampton boys grammar school—I do not know whether it is a county school or a voluntary school, but I strongly suspect that it is voluntary. The same sort of problem might occur in Wolverhampton. If the problem occurs with a Voluntary school that is not in a Roman Catholic enclave, it can frustrate the whole idea of going comprehensive. It is no good saying in Wolverhampton "Let us go comprehensive except for Wolverhampton boys grammar school ". If one keeps the grammar school, one does not go comprehensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need an answer to the question whether the managers or governors of a school who do not wish to go comprehensive while the local education authority does are to be allowed by the clause to
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
frustrate the democratic wishes of the people in the local education authority—a phrase that trips as easily from the hon. Member's lips as it does from mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all wish to respect the democratic wishes of people in local education authorities. I genuinely think that not even the Conservative Party would wish one voluntary school to be able under the Bill to keep the II-plus rolling in an authority that does not want the 11-plus to keep rolling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other significant matter that we must take into account about this list is that, although some of the implementation dates in it are in 1979—which is, I suspect, one reason why I have a feeling from the Whips opposite that they would like to see the Bill expedited a little, but I am sure that they would not wish us not to examine it thoroughly line by line, as is our tradition in Committee—some of the dates are not 1979, so for those latter schools there is no hurry. We can spend a long time talking about the matter. Some of them are 1980, and some are 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of those authorities—I can pick one or two—will go Labour next year. Some will go Labour in 1981. The hon. Gentleman seems to be proposing in the clause that a fag-end Tory administration, without consultation with parents or teachers, will be able to overturn the legally-fixed development plan for comprehensive education—fixed after widespread statutory consultation with both parents and teachers—knowing well, as did the Tameside Tories, that they are going out next time. Indeed, if the Government go on behaving like this, I suspect that the Tories will not keep one local education authority after a few years. That, we must admit, is what happens in this country. People vote in local elections on what they think of the national Government. Thus, for example, when Labour takes power next May in places like Bolton, it will find that a fag-end authority, which knew that it was coming to an end, has overturned plans due to be implemented in 1980. The new Labour authority will then have to go back to square one, with all the uncertainties of section I3, when it has been through the whole process before. We deserve more explanation from the hon. Gentleman as to what will happen in such a case, now that it is clear that these are not 1979, but 1980 and 1981 implementation schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman is seriously pro-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
posing that local education authorities should, without any consultation, be able to behave in that way, we hope that on Report we will receive better explanations. That is the reverse of democracy; it is government by decree—the option of a single vote in the local council, without the proper consultation and discussion that we are used to in education, and finally a single decision, which is a foregone conclusion, by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know the self-denying ordinance of hon. Gentlemen opposite, but I should have thought that someone like the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Mr. Thornton), who has important responsibilities for these matters, would have taken a more partisan attitude within the AMA on the matter. The hon Gentleman is one of the Conservatives who represent the future, in that they support comprehensive schemes, unlike some of their hon. Friend's—such as the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton)—who cling to the out-of-date idea of keeping the grammar schools going. If the AMA had not lost the services of the hon. Member for Garston and woken up to what is being proposed, even Conservative members of the AMA would not have wished Conservative councils to bind, as it were, their successors in this arbritary fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of these schemes in, for instance, Cumbria and Edenbridge, in Kent, are in the final stages of comprehensive reorganisation. The hon. Gentleman is encouraging reactionary Conservative members on the education committees of local authorities that have gone comprehensive—people like himself and the hon. Member for Macclesfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps mentioning me. A few sentences ago, he referred to democracy. Would he be interested to know that my views on education have been expressed consistently and forcibly in my constituency, and that I was successful in increasing my majority by 10,000, which is something that the hon. Gentleman did not do at the last election?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Macclesfield council which, is not responsible for education, has expressed strong views to the county council on its educational reorganisation plans. Macclesfield is one of the few areas in the country where the Conservatives increased their hold on the council, so perhaps the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
Gentleman would be a little more careful when he talks of people being reactionary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Macclesfield is composed of people who appreciate the excellence of the education provided by the Macclesfield high school and the King's school and the opportunities that those schools have given to people from all backgrounds in the area. The hon. Gentleman should not describe, in such unfortunate and discourteous ways, the people of the Macclesfield area who have made their views clearly known in democratic elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood me. Some of my best friends live in Macclesfield. I have the greatest respect for the hon. Gentleman and his views. I really should not refer to such things, Miss Fookes, but you and I spent the weekend together reviewing these matters in an historical context, along, I may say, with the chief education officer for Cheshire, who was telling me about Macclesfield and Congleton, and so on. He is one of the great chief education officers of Britain today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the hon. Gentleman's opinion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly my opinion, and, I think, the opinion of everybody at the conference. All the leaders of education were present. Indeed, there were one or two—I should not say this—officials of the Department of Education and Science.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It became clear that in spite of our respect for the hon. Members views about grammar schools, particularly in Macclesfield, if one views the development of secondary education in an historical context over the past 50 or 60 years, and tries to project it into the next 50 or 60 years, the hon. Member is reactionary. He may be right to be a reactionary, but he is certainly reactionary. He is fighting against what is a completely incontrovertible, long-term trend away from selection at 11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Historically, there is no way in which the hon. Gentleman can begin even to suggest that the opposite is the case. Although the Conservatives massively increased their majority and their grip on Cheshire, it was put to me that they also massively decided to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
repudiate the views of the hon. Member for Macclesfield regarding the retention of grammar schools. I regard the Cheshire Conservatives as some of the model Conservatives in Britain, by their having accepted the fact that we are in the twentieth century and having decided, in spite of the quite virulent campaign—wholly honourable—of the hon. Member for Macclesfield, to take no notice of him and go comprehensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must point out that the overwhelming number of those on the Cheshire education committee represent areas which have already gone comprehensive—I am the first to admit that. But the majority of councillors representing the Macclesfield constituency on the Cheshire county council are opposed to going comprehensive. Unfortunately, only two of them sit on the education committee, and they are in trouble with their electorate for the views which they have expressed on this matter. There is a ground swell of public opinion in Macclesfield against comprehensive education and the views which I have expressed represent fairly accurately the Views of a majority of my electors. I do not seek to speak for other parts of Cheshire. I speak for my own voters who elect me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I find it more of a strain than ever to find any connection between the way the debate is running and the amendments under consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point, Miss Fookes. But I put it to you that an attitude of a body of managers or governors—an attitude such as that of the hon. Member—as against that of a local education authority is central to the amendments whether it be in Wolverhampton boys grammar school or Macclesfield grammar school or the Roman Catholic schools in Bexley. That attitude seems to be that either a reactionary local education authority which has been elected this May is much more reactionary than its predecessors, or that a reactionary—or dissatisfied in some way—body of managers or governors can frustrate at a stroke the long-worked-out consultative procedures, consultations which, in nearly all these cases have gone back long beyond the 1976
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
Act. This is nothing to do with the 1976 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultations in almost every local education authority started in the 1960s' After solid consultation which has sometimes lasted for 10, 13 or 15 years, with teachers, parents and youngsters preparing to go to a particular sort of school. with teachers already appointed under signed contracts to teach in particular sorts of school, and with parents already having had their children allocated to particular schools, Simply to say that local education authorities shall be able, at a stroke, to wipe all that out without any consultation is absolutely astonishing. It is equally astonishing that the Government should have put the clause in and, even having put it in, that they should then say that the majority of schemes affected by the clause are not for implementation in 1979 at all but in 1980 and even in 1981 in some cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is saying "No consultation with parents, no consultation with teachers" when there are two full years during which consultation might take place on many of these schemes. The more I look at this list, the more I see why he was so reluctant to give it to the Committee because it has opened up the dictatorial nature of the legislation which the Government have introduced. The present Lord Chancellor, when in opposition, talked about the dictatorship of the majority. I do not believe that anything could provide a better example or paradigm of the dictatorship of the majority than the provisions of the clause and the apparent determination of the Government to resist this very sensible amendment, even for cases where there is plenty of time for consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister simply uttered the two-letter word "no ". The words "no consultation" will ring around Britain, and everybody in local education authorities now knows within weeks of the establishment of a Conservative Government, where that Government stand on consultation with parents and teachers. We have heard the word—it is "no". The Minister had the arrogance to speak of the sudden conversion of this side of the Committee to the idea of consultation with parents and teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was only too familiar with the situation in the ILEA between 1968 and 1970 or 1971, when the Conservatives held office. The Conservatives made noises and put out consultation about it, but in my memory—I sat on one of the first governing bodies to meet after statutory parents and teachers had been put on to those bodies but my memory may be dimming in my old age and I may be wrong although I believe that I am right—it was immediately after Labour took control that the first governing bodies in ILEA with elected parents and elected teachers took over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was reminded of exactly those circumstances—proposals coming forward under a Tory regime but having to be implemented with a Labour ILEA—by my reading of the Tory manifesto, because there, again, we had proposals put by Conservatives. The difference between this situation and that existing in inner London in the late 1960s appears to be that proposals came forward, and the members endorsed them—at least some of them did—while the Labour Party was in office; whereas now proposals come forward in the form of a manifesto asking for there to be a clear duty on Government and local authorities to take account of parents' wishes, but when the opportunity is afforded to a Conservative Government to implement such a promise, within weeks of being elected the answer, as my hon. Friend says, is no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The House and the country will take note of that fact. By this time I should have thought that sheer shame would have induced the Under-Secretary of State to give way gracefully and accept the amendments. It would be a simple way of making good progress, and we all want to make progress and get the Bill through. But the obstinate way in which the Conservative Party puts certain principles in its election manifesto and then contradicts them in the first piece of legislation it brings forward is not the way to make reasonable progress in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will be disposed to accept the amendments. As I said, the Labour Party has an immensely better record on consulting parents and teachers than has the Conservative Party. If it was the Tory ILEA which did it, that should be an additional reason for the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Greenway) to vote—if there is a vote—with his conscience, not with his party, for our amendment. I very much hope that not only the hon. Member for Ealing, North but all other hon. Members opposite—some of whom are approaching their first Committee vote—will vote for parental and teacher consultation, and not vote for the Russian Soviet "Niet" attitude that they have from their own party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eastham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before then, there are one or two questions that I should like to pose. Fortunately for me, my authority will not be affected by the Bill or by this clause, because it has been comprehensive for a good many years, and no political party would dare to attempt to revert to the system under which we suffered on previous occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said, on occasion, that there is resistance to comprehensive education because it is more costly. But I wonder whether there are some other sinister reasons on the part of certain authorities whereby they do not want to spend more money on education. Some of the list of authorities do not have a particularly good track record when it comes to spending money from the rates on providing education. Is there possibly some collusion even on the part of central Government? Being mindful of the recent Budget, with instructions coming from the Chancellor or from the Department of the Environment that less must be spent on education, perhaps there is a sinister reason for some of these
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
authorities resisting the comprehensive system. Certainly, it is very costly to provide education on a comprehensive basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words "comprehensive education" are trotted out so often that we should remind ourselves that primary schools are comprehensive schools. Primary schools are comprehensive, but somehow the words become magical at the age of I1, when there has to be some segregation without any justification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the system we used to have in my own city we had a diagnostic test. What was that test? It was an assessment of a child's performance on that particular day. There was no guarantee that in the future that child would match up to the tests he took at the age of 11. Neither was there any provision for the child who surprised everyone, who turned out to be a late developer and made rapid progress. However, because numbers in schools are restricted, those children cannot be transferred, and little provision is made for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NUT is mindful of the fact that when we went comprehensive that meant a considerable extension of educational provision. I believe that even in the areas that were listed today, in some of the more backward authorities parents are understandably, trying to do the best that they can for their children. However, not all children will receive that better education. For that reason, some parents—it favoured the rich—had special coaching for their children, to make sure that they got through the magical barrier date of the 1I-plus and ensure that they went forward satisfactorily, but there was little concern for the rest of the children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.00 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister be good enough to explain whether there is any other sinister reason? Possibly the Government want to spend less money on education through those authorities not going comprehensive, because there have been clear and categorical statements by numerous members of the Government that less money must be spent. Obviously, education is a big spender, and in my authority we pride ourselves on making such provision for our children. If there is a retardation of implementation, it will mean that some children will receive a lesser education and will not be given the provision that they expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember that some years ago in my
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
authority there was a great campaign about comprehensive schools being too big, and that small was beautiful. However, the pattern has developed that some of the most popular schools in my city of Manchester are the very largest, with perhaps I,500 pupils. They are also very expensive schools, which need all types of equipment—a complete range for technical, scientific, and physical education, and so on—and which is being provided. Parents say they want it and that they want more of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister please explain the Government's attitude? Have they a sinister reason for trying to curtail expenditure in the form of ratepayers' and Government money? It is a factor worthy of consideration and I should be grateful for some answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Under-Secretary of State would probably be able to supply some more answers. I wish too to be brief. There has been inadequacy in the Government's response to what we have insisted—I believe that the Minister must believe it himself—is a very reasonable proposition that seeks not to water down the Bill but to put further assurances into it. Those assurances would be in keeping with the undertaking given by the Conservative Party at the time of the last election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we have put those considerations, asked for consultation and presented the idea that revocation is a significant step in itself, the only response that we have had is a series of debating points about the status of the Labour Party in respect of consultation with parents. We can argue about that, and I am sure that over the next few years we shall argue our respective parties, policies towards the principle of consultation to a very thorough extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is not a worthy answer to our proposal for an amendment to the Bill, for the Minister to try to blackguard us with any past undertakings or failures to make undertakings. I do not believe that that is what Committee procedures are about. You are a much greater authority in such matters than I am, Miss Fookes, but it appears to me that if we are trying to sustain the two principles of scrutiny, examination and questioning, and of improvement, the amendment is commendable and should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only answer we have received on the substantive point of consultation, as opposed to the various debating dodges
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
used by the Minister, is that consultation is not now necessary before revocation because of the consultations which took place before the implementation of the 1976 Act. The theory is that, because consultation took place when it became clear to local education authorities that under a Labour Government they would have to give consideration to comprehensive reorganisation, the consultation they undertook then will be Valid for all time, the postures struck then, the attitudes manifested, the publicity given, and the arguments rehearsed at that time are something we have to accept not as transitory manifestations of opinion but as tablets of stone, the great permanent immovables.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No reasonable person could accept that. But the attitude expressed by the Minister is that consultation is not now necessary because it took place once before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ask ourselves: with whom were the consultations undertaken? Who was articulate in those consultations? Were the consultations conducted in an objective and dispassionate atmosphere, assessing the educational needs of all the children in an area? Was that consultation, such as it was, prejudiced, or was the atmosphere in which it was conducted affected by the attitudes of the local education authority or the traditions of the area?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that when consultations took place, either in the wake of circular 10/65 or immediately preceding the need to introduce the 1976 Act, or, indeed, since the 1976 Act, there is strong evidence to indicate that we were not so much getting consultation in those areas by the local education authorities with the parents concerned, whether parents of children in primary schools and secondary schools, as not getting consultation at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we were getting was a doughtily fought rearguard action by local education authorities ably and generously assisted by vested interests in the grammar schools—sometimes parental Vested interests; I not blame people for manifesting their interests in their children in that fashion—and by the mobilisation of the Conservative Party in that area. Again, I do not object to that. But whether those procedures, that tradition and that system could amount to consultation is a different argument altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also strong evidence to show that even when parents, with the hope of

removing selective education, made well-organised and well-researched approaches to local education authorities, with well-argued pleas for the reorganisation of secondary education comprehensively in their area, the local education authorities in the manner of a board in a Dickensian novel sat behind their table, listened to the representations, went through the formality of questioning and then went into conclave and surprisingly, or unsurprisingly, a few days later appeared with a statement that, after taking into account the representations, after looking at the needs and realities of the area, after balancing all the factors and the representations made to them by grammar school parents, or by parents who aspired for their children to get to the grammar school via the selective system as against the opinions expressed by parents and teachers who did not accept the necessity or validity of the selective system, they had come down in favour of a selective system and the retention of the grammar schools. I am sure that the Minister would be the first to recognise that the relative force with which middle-class parents and interests can put their points of view was also a factor which weighed more than usually heavily in those decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, what I am saying to the Under-Secretary is that if his reason for turning down our amendment for consultation is that he really believes that consultation in respect of these schools which will become the subject of revocation was satisfactorily undertaken at some previous stage, he must surely think again. No one could accept that the atmosphere in which those so-called consultations were conducted was anything approaching the kind of balanced weighing of evidence that is typical of our processes of review in so many other areas. Whether we are talking about planning permissions or consultation that local authorities undertake when making proposals for extensions or developments of various kinds, it is not acceptable—it cannot be acceptable—to the Minister or to the Committee to say that consultation has satisfactorily taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a practical example. Last Thursday I mentioned Erith and Kingston upon Thames. This morning the Minister has mentioned Erith and Kingston upon Thames. I would be the first to recognise that for various reasons they are not directly subject to the povrisions of the Bill. In Erith parents in respect of two
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
schools want no change from the comprehensive system. In Kintston upon Thames there are a substantial number of parents who want to change a comprehensive system. In both areas there is a Tory local education authority. In the case of Erith that Tory local education authority is in a position, despite the wishes of the parents in respect of these two schools, to try to bring about change. In the case of Kingston upon Thames, despite the wishes of parents in those areas, a Tory local authority is in a position to prevent any change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must break free of that system; we must understand what the hon. Gentleman said about parents being more important than politicians and realise that the local people know best. There can be only one definition in respect of reorganisation of secondary education, whether it is reorganisation towards comprehensivisation, or whether it is revocation, which is a form of reorganisation, as I am sure the Minister will acknowledge. There really can be only one test. If the Minister means what he says about local people knowing best, their will must surely prevail over the attitudes of those local education authorities. Whether it is the wish of local people, as represented through boards of governors, or different forms of public enunciation—pressures, the way in which they communicate, the meetings which they attend and the views they express—to try to prevent change away from the comprehensive system or whether it is to try to bring about change towards a comprehensive system, their will should prevail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A discusison took place between my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West and the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton)—I am not trying to tickle him into further participation in the debate—in which an allegation was made. Cheshire local education authority wants one thing, but up jumps the hon. Member for Macclesfield and says, "Yes, they might want to, but the county councillors from my area who are on that local education authority are in trouble with their electorate because they have got it all wrong as far as the electorate is concerned. The electorate from that area put up my majority by 10,000."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall always be leaving the course of these children's future to that kind of speculation, depending on whether a rise in the Conservative parliamentary candidate's majority outweighs the attitude
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
expressed for the whole of the county, or on whether we should take more interest of the political opinion of two county councillors from a certain area or the attitude expressed by the parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How are we to resolve the dilemma? Do we believe the hon. Member—and I mean "honourable"—for Macclesfield, do we believe his two county councillors, do we believe the local education authority, do we believe the grammar school parents, or do we believe the secondary school parents or the primary school parents?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are doing in this amendment, first, as a principle in the Bill but something which can be extended beyond this Bill—we shall be having a comprehensive, or at least a more widespread, Education Bill towards the end of this year—is trying to build in a systematic procedure, before change can take place, of full-scale consultation. It is not good enough for the Minister to say, in respect of these schools which are affected by section 2 of the Education Act 1976, "We have been through the consultation." He knows that that cannot qualify for authoritative or democratic consultation such as that which took place before and since the 1976 Act in respect of the schools affected by this Bill. I know it, too, and the parents involved know it, on whichever side of the argument they are. He does education no service, and certainly he does democracy no service, if he fails to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State now has a further chance to accept the amendment, persuaded, as he must be, by my arguments and by his own recognition of the needs of those areas. If he does so, no one will be happier than we shall be. We shall even be content with an undertaking to give further consideration to the vexed problem of consultation and to find some means of carrying out such consultation. But, if he cannot either accept the amendment or give us such an undertaking, my hon. Friends and I will have to divide the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Flannery</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had no intention of speaking again, but the contribution of the Under-Secretary of State was so shot through with contradiction that we must go on record as refuting his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's whole contribu-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
tion was a negation of years of speeches that he has made. As I said earlier, we have received, from hon. Members who are not on this Committee, endless homilies on consultation with parents. One would have thought that we were people who never consulted parents, and that we could possibly be won over to consult by endless lectures. After all those lectures, it is almost unbelievable that the Conservative Party can vote against two amendments with which it must agree. If it does not agree with the amendments, all the speeches that were made in the past were empty verbiage. None of them had anything to do with reality. They expressed an empty, arid dogmatism in which the persons making the speeches did not believe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are accused of undergoing a late conversion. If one accepts the Conservative argument that the Labour Party has been lately converted to participation with parents—which is not true—surely that is a good thing, for it would mean that the amendments embodied that conversion to a viewpoint which the Conservatives have hitherto held—or said that they held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) was deputy chairman of the Sheffield education committee. I was on the Labour group at that same time. I well remember the endless consultation that we had with parents about comprehensive education. For instance, at one stage we found that many of our people did not understand what comprehensive education was. Many of them innocently thought that it was just a bringing together of the modern school, the grammar school and the technical school under one roof. My hon. Friend and I, and Councillor Peter Horton, the present chairman, deliberately started a branch of the Socialist Education Association to try to teach many of our own people, as well as parents, what comprehensive education was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We won out on a considerable scale. I remember the year, for instance, when the consultations with every section of the community came to fruition. The local press warned us that, if we went to the municipal elections on a platform of comprehensive education, our vote would plummet. In fact, that year we had the biggest vote that we ever had, because the people of Sheffield, having been thoroughly consulted and realising what comprehensive education was, gave us a pre-
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
ponderant vote to notify us that they wanted comprehensive education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all the consultations that have gone on endlessly since then, if anyone were to attempt to unscramble the comprehensive schools in Sheffield, they would be faced with a revolutionary situation. The people would not tolerate the unscrambling of something for which they themselves have fought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give examples which refute the accusation that we have not consulted. I was head of only a small school—a middle school—and I spent most of my time in primary, although I have taught secondary. We had, and have, at that school, as has every school in Sheffield, including nursery schools, a board of managers, and elected parents are on it as well as people from the local council. We began with one elected parent on each board and there are now two or three. There are elected teachers—we began with one but there are more now, according to the size of the school. Believe it or not, we have elected members of the non-teaching staff in every school in Sheffield. There is full democracy. Elections are carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has heard this evidence before. Now I say to him "Go to our city, go to many cities, and check up." We have no fear whatsoever. The hon. Gentleman will find massive consultation going on. But I have no hope whatsoever that the hon. Gentleman, having found such a situation, will report it to the Committee or the House. The Government will still say that there is no consultation, although we can give evidence that there is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can one respect the stated viewpoint of the Government when, having given them all the evidence, they still say that there is no consultation, when we have to embody the fact that we want consultation in two amendments and ask the Government to accept them? We are driven to one conclusion, whether we like it or not. All these years, the Tories have been making hollow talk about wanting consultation. Here is an opportunity to introduce provisions for consultation. Here is agreement between us in principle, but whereas we can prove that there has been genuine and massive consultation in practice, the hon. Gentleman can prove it only when that consultation will help the Tory Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality is that we on this side of the Committee want consultation to help
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
education not just to advance the cause of a particular party, and the result of that consultation is that 85 per cent. of Britain's children are in comprehensive schools. By this Bill, the hon. Gentleman is using the other I5 per cent. in order to make inroads into that 85 per cent. Let us, at this stage, appeal to the Government to do what they say they believe in and introduce consultation with parents and teachers—parents, if that is all they want, but we should prefer to include teachers as well. Our agreement is embodied in the two amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise again to ask one question. It has not been answered, yet it is absolutely central to the clause. It is wholly against the tradition of Committee proceedings that the Minister should flatly refuse to answer a question following genuine doubt about the meaning of wording in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause, can managers or governors exercise revocation against the wishes of, or even without consultation with, the relevant local education authority? The whole structure of the 1944 Act, which I have been re-reading in the latest edition of Taylor and Saunders, States that, even under section I3, when section 13 notices were put in, there had to be consultation with the local education authority—those concerned had to make sure that they had building permission for new schools—and that even when the Secretary of State was approving or disapproving manager's or governors' proposals under section 13 he had to have regard to the situation of the local education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not, because if the words "managers or governors concerned" are taken out we shall have to say why they were put in. I can answer the hon. Gentleman now, but there will be further debate on amendment No. 6, as he, wisely I believe, accepted there should be. I know that we have wandered all around the world this morning but it appears to me that the debate on managers and governors should be there. I will answer the hon. Gentleman now—I presume this will provide him with another opportunity for a speech before we get to amendment No. 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be answered. May I make myself clear? In my view the next amendment is quite different. We are talking about two wholly different situations. The first situation, which we are now debating, is one where section I3 proposals have been approved. The whole procedure has gone through, we are talking about the right of revocation by local education authorities and/or managers and governors and I want to know the situation of managers and governors there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second situation, which we are coming to, is one where the section 13 procedure has begun but is not finished. I also want to know the position of the two bodies as they affect each other there. But they are two totally different situations. This is far more urgent because it concerns changes in teachers' jobs, in kids' schools, in the use of school buildings this September—that is why it is much more urgent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The interpretation, as I understand it, of this particular point between the two commas made by the hon. Gentleman is that the Voluntary governors could apply for revocation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The gobbets drop out one by one. We might have had this fact in the initial speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Boyson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was understood. It was only the hon. Gentleman who did not understand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this is So, then in regard to the "managers or governors concerned" I see that there is no interpretation clause, as there is in many Bills, which spells out the meaning of the words. The Minister will know that there are many managers or governors of schools. Although, theoretically, a voluntary school has to be in some local education authority, very often the school affects one or more local education authorities—this is particularly true of Roman Catholic schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not at all clear—perhaps the Minister is certain—that the words "managers or governors concerned" have a meaning in law. But if what the Minister says is true, this runs totally contrary to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
every Education Act since 1944. In the 1944 Act right up to the 1976 Act, every time a power has been given to a body of managers or governors or a duty imposed upon them, on every occasion consultative procedures with the relevant local education authority have been laid down in law. The Minister will remember the difficulty we had in the negotiations with the voluntary schools in 1976 about the exact relationship and the transmission of schemes—the difference between sub mission and transmission—under the 1976 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that we have a reporter from 
	<i>Education</i> present because most of the education press is suspended. Normally we conduct these debates about education with 
	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> coming out week after week, with learned editorials by Stuart Maclure telling us all about the nitty-gritty and the implications of things. We now have only one weekly on which we can rely to tease out these points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is very important. The Minister is saying that a body of managers or governors has been given—for the first time ever in English education law—the right to wreck its relevant local education authority's comprehensive scheme if it so wishes. I am sure that this list has no status in law but is simply one drawn up by the Department, but whether or not the Minister can provide a scheme out of the list I believe that from a legal point of view relating to the powers of local education authorities, this is something which the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Mr. Thornton) would never have accepted. The AMMA executive would never have accepted it, if it had understood the full implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that two of the areas concerned are Wirral (Bebington and Pensby) and Wirral (Deeside). The hon. Member is responsible for those areas and no doubt knows all about the consultation with parents there, the likelihood of revocation, and whether there are any voluntary schools within those areas that could go counter to the views of the Wirral local education authority. But it makes me even more determined that we should both vote for the amendment and come back to the whole principle of the issue on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
I hope that the Minister will go back and have another discussion with his legal advisers on the matter. The legal advisers to the Department of Education and Science do not have the most magnificent track record in the legal world over the past 20 years. I admit that it was mostly under Labour Governments that they came to grief, rather than under Conservative Governments. But now they have a brand new team. So I hope that this clause underwent the sort of Scrutiny with the AMMA that it deserved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that many chairmen of education committees whom I know would be absolutely horrified if they realised the full implications of giving a single school—perhaps among 20 or 30 schools—the right to frustrate the achievement of the abolition of the 11-plus and the creation of comprehensive education. One cannot tell from this list—only certain schools are mentioned, and in other cases no schools at all are mentioned—how many voluntary schools are involved in these schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a very important matter, and I am astonished that we have total silence from the experts opposite, no doubt instructed by their Whips because Cumbria or some particular Tory in some particular education committee desperately wants to get something legally through next Monday week before the kids go home on holiday. That is what the Bill is all about. The Government are desperate to push it through the House of Commons before the last day of term comes and the parents cannot be contacted to be told that their children are to be reallocated to different schools by September.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their desire to rush the Bill through, the Government might at least have drafted it in conformity with the traditional relationships between local education authorities and managers and governors. But they have not done so. I am horrified by the Minister's answer, and I hope that we shall show our belief in the amendment and our horror at the structure of subsection (3) in the appropriate way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 2, line 6, leave out "managers or governors concerned".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the discussion on the last amendment, this one takes on greater import and there is a greater understanding of its implications. However, I should like another list. We were given a scrappy list of local education authorities, from which Croydon, East Sussex, Lancashire and Manchester had been crossed out, but which did not list individual schools affected by subsection (3) of section 13. In order to debate the amendment fully we must have a list not only of the education authorities in this category under subsection (4) but of the schools within those local education authorities and information on whether they are country or voluntary schools. One cannot begin to consider the amendment unless one knows the subject under discussion. We are discussing all those local education authorities that have pinned the section I3 notices to the school doors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will know, Miss Fookes, although not everybody knows, the procedures that have to be undergone when section 13 notices are displayed. One of those stages is the public notice procedure and it is normal for local education authorities to place notices in the local Press. However, it is laid down in the 1944 Act that a notice must be pinned to the door. The school at which I taught had about 50 doors—it was a rambling ex-grammar school—and it could not be decided to which door the notice should be pinned. Eventually three doors were chosen, putting the lists around at random.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, this subsection applies to those situations where the procedures of the 1976 Act move forward the development plans submitted, Under the Act the local education authorities or the managers or governors concerned—which ever the case may be—have reached the stage, even if by one day when the Royal Assent is granted, of posting notices
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
under, section 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection, as I,understand purports to give local education authorities or managers and governors concerned an option. It is possible for them to do nothing. If, the local education authorities decide to do nothing, because clauses 1, 2 and 3. of the 1976 .Act will be repealed if this Bill receives the Royal Assent, the section 13 notices will be deemed to have fallen, nothing more need be done, no parent need protest. That will be the end of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the local education authority should wish to carry on with the procedures of the 1976 Act, notwithstanding the fact that sections 1, 2 and 3 of the 1976 Act are no more, it may elect, by 1 October 1979—we shall come to 1979 later—to ask the Secretary of State to pretend that the 1976. Act still exists, and to go through the motions of continuing the consideration of its section 13 proposals so that its schools go, comprehensive either in 1979—although in that case it will have to get, a move on if it has only just posted notices—or by 1980 or 1981, or whichever date is in the plans put forward under the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many ways we should welcome the clause, because it clears up some of the utter chaos created on the ground by the Bill. It gives local education authorities which want to proceed in an orderly manner over the years towards comprehensive education an opportunity to do so. However, I draw attention once again to the situation which was alluded to on the previous amendment, which could exist if, in any of the proposals, local education authorities and managers or governors of schools should not be of the same mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that, under the 1976 Act, local education, authorities submitted their own plans but transmitted voluntary schools' plans. That was an attempt to enforce a certain harmonisation between the approach of the voluntary school towards secondary reorganisation and the approach of the local education authority. I participated in some of the discussions with the. voluntary schools about the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
working out of those elaborate schemes of submission and transmission, and I think it was one of the most sensible ways of seeking co-operation on comprehensive, education between voluntary schools and local education auhorities that have been invented. In the end all who were consulted—the churches and other voluntary bodies—assented to what was a very sensible arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty that has existed in the past where voluntary schools have, come up against local education authorities has been tragic. This happened with Emanuel in London and King Edward's in Southampton, and many voluntary schools up and down the country, which were Wounded fore the poor of the parish- by devout Christians thinking that they were leaving their money to schools for the poor. I think that many of the governors of voluntary schools, such as Mary Datchelor in South London which preferred to close down rather than go comprehensive, have behaved in a wholly irresponsible manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to put tremendous blame on the system, but one of the flaws in the system as it has developed was a flaw in the 1944 Act which, because of the insistent demands of the churches in 1944, set out, as it were, two railway lines: one line for local education authorities and county schools, another line for the managers and governors of voluntary schools as to development plans; and nowhere did the twain meet, except that, under section I3(2) the voluntary schools shall:
	<br><blockquote><p>"after consultation with the authority submit proposals for that purpose to the Minister"</p></blockquote>
In other words, it is laid down in section 13 that voluntary schools cannot make proposals under section I3 except after consultation with their local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is now Saying that, although they cannot make proposals except after consultation with the local education authorities, they can cancel proposals without any consultation with teachers, parents or the community, and without even the local education authority which pays every penny of current expenditure for the school—the State paying 85 per cent. of capital expenditure and outside repairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To give a quango such as a board of managers or governors, almost wholly
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
financed by the State the right to cock a snook at the local education authority to Whom it owes at least the duty of attempting to co-operate in the production of plans and the development of education is absolutely amazing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather disturbed at my hon. Friend's use of the word "quango" to describe governing bodies. Although I accept that, in all the definitions of the term, they are quangos, we understand that the Government are committed to abolishing quangos. Surely we should not be encouraging the Government to abolish governors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Government are to abolish governors. We may have the opportunity of discussions on that matter on another Bill which I understand, if this Bill is dealt with expeditiously as I hope it will, is to be brought forward later. But the pace at which information seems to be coming forward is not conducive to the expeditious disposition of the present Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The papers that were being shuffled a moment ago on the Government Benches, which happily I thought would float onto my desk so that I could see the new section 13 list and the extent to which managers or governors were concerned and the extent to which local education authorities were concerned, seems to have been lost without trace once more. Therefore, in making this introductory speech am unable to canvass the amendment as fully as I should wish to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is crucial. I give one example so that the Committee can understand. The first school in which I taught after leaving university was King Edward VI school, Southampton—an ancient foundation which people such as Isaac Watts, the great hymn writer, attended. It is a very famous school which happened to be a voluntary aided school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say "happened to be"a voluntary aided school because whether schools became county schools or voluntary schools in 1944 was totally an accident of the endowments. Well-endowed schools were allowed to remain Voluntary schools, but if they did not have enough money to effect their own repairs, and if they were falling to pieces after the war, they became county schools. There is, therefore, nothing magical about whether a school happens to be a voluntary school or a county
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
school; it is a pure accident of history as to which category it falls into.

When Southampton wanted to' go independent, it decided to have a sixth-form college comprehensive system. After much 'cajoling, agreeing and disagreeing, and votes on 'the governors' board, when the new Conservative Hampshire said that it was sorry but Southampton was going comprehensive, like it or not, the King Edward School, when it was taken over under local government reform, finally decided—utterly wrongly, in my view—to make itself a school for the rich instead of a school for the poor, as it had thitherto been; a school with fairly hefty fees, instead of a school with no fees at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It took that decision because there was no method under the 1944 Act whereby the governors of King Edward's—who are all the great and good of the town; the chairman of the local newspaper, and folk such as that—the local city council, and, later, the Hampshire county council by which those two bodies could undertake concertation procedures, so to speak. They could have done it voluntarily, but there was no legal statutory framework to force them together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the problem arising from this amendment and from previous discussion of the relationship of voluntary governors and managers in secondary education and the local authority, has always been a difficult one. I do not disagree with the points made by the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) about the 1944 Act and what has happened since. All of us have experience of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would appear, from the interpretation of the wording of this Bill, that, in respect of the question which the hon. Gentleman asked me, authorities could apply directly. The same would apply to this clause. However, if they did apply directly and if the local education authority disagreed, we could be in one of those mild impasses to which the hon. Gentleman has referred and of which he has had experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, they could apply for revocation under the Bill. if the local education authority opposed that, a decision would have to be taken by the Secretary of State. The question is whether it would ever happen in that particular way. I have tried to give some elucidation on the point, although it is a delicate matter. I shall speak at greater length on the subject later,
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
but I thought that I should intervene at this stage, because the hon. Gentleman was moving towards the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very pleased with that intervention, because I think that we are getting somewhere. 'I put down amendment No. 8, which' was not selected. In your wisdom, Miss Fookes, it was deemed to be outwith, or wholly against, or wholly redundant to, the Bill. In it, I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"nor shall the Secretary of State confirm any such application if the arrangements for the admission of pupils to the schools in the area continue to be based (wholly or partly) on selection by reference to ability or aptitude'."</p></blockquote>
In other words, I tried to put forward some sort of amendment to this clause which would give legal guidance to the Sectetary of State about what attitude he might take if there were a dispute of the type that I suggested earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that before Thursday we shall be able to think of a number of other ways, now that this discussion has arisen, of trying to amend the clause—the Minister has openly admitted that he agrees with much that I have said; it is a knotty and difficult problem when local education authorities; managers and governors disagree—through legislation to lay the Secretary of State under some sort of legal guidance about those matters to which he should have regard if he were to take a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for the Minister to say that if there were a dispute about election under the clause between the voluntary schools and the local education authority he might not agree to section 13 notices for the voluntary schools. However, we are legislating, and we should write something into the Bill which can give the Secretary of State some guidance in the exercise of his discretion under section 13 about what he should do in such a situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1976 Act necessitated long consultations on the matter. The matter is one of the products of rushed legislation—this is a rushed Bill; I do not think that anyone would deny that. I believed that it was the very first Bill tabled in this Parliament, in a desperate attempt to help some of the backwoodsmen in the Tory Party to get out of their legal obligations to go comprehensive this September. It has already been exposed, in both the previous subsection and this subsection, as suffering from all the problems of rushed legislation in that no consideration has been given to what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
would happen if there was, a dispute between the proposals of the local education authority and the proposals of a voluntary school in this regard,
There is no excuse. The Minister had the 1976 Act precedent whereby the managers and governors of a voluntary school still had the right to form their own proposals. That right was not taken away from them as they feared. That. is why under the 1976 Act there was so much lobbying from the Roman Catholics, the Church of England and some other voluntary bodies, They feared that they would lose their equality of treatment with local education authorities. In the end we managed to give them that reassurance. They accepted that though they had this right to equality of treatment under the dual 1944 system whereby voluntary schools and county schools are held in equal esteem, nevertheless the voluntary schools also had a duty laid on them to consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That duty to consult was laid down in 1944 under the section 13 procedure. It was laid down in the 1976 Act procedure: it was not simply a duty to consult but a duty to transmit. It was a duty for the local education authority to act as postman for the schemes put, up by the governors of voluntary bodies. But in this Bill, where there is an election procedure to tear everything down—this demolition Bill—it is becoming clear not only that there are no procedures .for concertation and consultation between local education authorities and voluntary bodies, but that the Minister has not even thought about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extremely worrying. What has frustrated comprehensive education in those authorities such as London, Southampton, Wolverhampton and others, whose electorates have voted time and time again for comprehensive education on many occasions, has been the insistence of one or two voluntary schools on saying,
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
"No, we do not want to go comprehensive, and you must run an 11-plus examination for the whole of London, simply because we intend to stick to our rights and not go comprehensive."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the managers and governors of voluntary. schools have realised that that was a mistaken attitude. Over the past few years it has been found that the real hardliners, such as Haberdashers', Emanuel, Colfe in Lewisham, when it is put to them like that, have said, "All right. We will go independent. We will turn our back on our former role"—sometimes running back 400 years—"and we will turn ourselves into schools for the rich or, at any rate, for the middle class, and charge fees for the first time for many years."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But by far the vast majority of voluntary schools have said that they want to go comprehensive. Some of the voluntary schools in my borough of Lewisham, like Haberdashers' and Prendergast—voluntary schools which have every right to dig their toes in and say that they were going independent and that they wanted to be more like Eton and Harrow than like Forest Hill comprehensive—have said that even though they are small schools and do not easily fit into a comprehensive system, notwithstanding all the difficulties, they accept the fact that the nation has voted to go comprehensive, that comprehensive education is now accepted by people at large as the norm and therefore they will go comprehensive—sometimes as two- or three-form entry comprehensive schools. They are working very well and none of them has any regrets about their decision.
