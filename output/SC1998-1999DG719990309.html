	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. John Hutton)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Government Finance (Wales) Special Grant Report (No. 2) (Wales) 1999.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Local Government Finance (Scotland) Special Grant Report (No. 1/1999) and the Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 38).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These reports, made under section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 and section 108A of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 as it relates to Scotland, specify determinations concerning special grants which the Government propose to pay to certain local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales. The grant reports have been submitted by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health, and my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales. They set out the agreements for the grants in respect to the costs to local authorities from 1 April 1998 to 31 March 1999 of supporting asylum seekers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will know that asylum seekers who claim asylum at the point of arrival in this country are entitled to social security benefits which cover their needs for housing, food and other necessities unless and until their application for asylum is rejected, at which point benefits are withdrawn. Those who claim asylum after entering the country are not entitled to those benefits. Local authorities are responsible, under the provisions of the National Assistance Act 1948 and the Children Act 1989 in England and Wales, and the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 and the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, for supporting those asylum seekers not entitled to social security benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will also know that we are committed to a radical reform of the current arrangements for immigration and asylum. We inherited a shambles from the previous Governemt. The system was protracted and labyrinthine, and the support grants to local authorities for the work that they were doing to support asylum seekers were inadequate and unfair. We set out our proposlas to modernise the system in the Home Office White Paper, "Fairer, Faster and Firmer—A Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum", and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary recently introduced legislation to this House which will improve the efficiency of immigration control; simplify and speed up the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
appeals system; regulate immigration advisers and tackle those who act unscrupulously; strengthen immigration controls; and give new powers to marriage registrars. In addition, we will introduce new, unified arrangements for asylum seekers in genuine need. We intend to deal with asylum applications quickly and fairly, so that genuine asylum seekers receive the protection to which they are entitled, and those who seek to abuse the asylum process are given no opportunity to play the system by pursuing appeals with no chance of success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in that context that hon. Members should consider the grant reports before us today. We have made significant improvements to the grant regime. In doing so, we have consulted closely representatives of local government and the voluntary sector. The reports represent a step on the way to our goal of a modern asylum system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our improvements to the grant system have been strongly supported by local authorities. In the past year, there has been a substantial increase in the number of asylum seekers arriving in Britain. In 1997–98, we received 32,000 applications for asylum. In 1998–99, the Home Office estimates that the number could be as high as 53,000. The great majority of asylum seekers come to London. On 19 February, 14,579 adults were being accommodated by London local authorities, as were 9,475 families and nearly 2,000 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. In addition, there are significant numbers of asylum seekers in south-east England due to the location of the channel ports and Gatwick airport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Large numbers of asylum seekers in London and the south-east place a major demand on local authority social services as well as on housing and other services. It is not right that the cost should fall on local council tax payers or that local services for local people should suffer, as, I am sad to say, was the position under the previous Administration. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has therefore brought forward proposals in the Immigration and Asylum Bill to ensure a more even distribution of asylum seekers. In the meantime, we intend to make special grants that will substantially alleviate the burden on local authorities that accommodate asylum seekers. In doing so, we shall make significant improvements to the terms of the special grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In previous years there have been separate grant reports for adults, families and unaccompanied children in England. Because we have simplified the grants this year, there is just one grant report, but it contains different terms for each category of asylum seeker. The grant will enable local authorities to claim funds up to the equivalent of £165 per person per week in the current year in respect of adults accommodated under the National Assistance Act 1948 in England and Wales and the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 in Scotland. That represents an increase of 18 per cent. on last year's grant of £140 per person per week and will more accurately reflect the cost of accommodation,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0312">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
particularly for authorities in London and the south-east. The £165 maximum can be made up of costs for accommodation and board and set the authorities' administrative costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under section 17 of the Children Act 1989 and section 22 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 local authorities have a general duty to safeguard the welfare of children in their area who are in need and, so far as is consistent with that duty, to promote the upbringing of such children by their families by providing an appropriate range and level of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of families with children, the purpose of the grant is to reimburse local authorities for the additional expenditure that they incur in the current year as a result of supporting asylum-seeking families. In previous years the English grant has been subject to a threshold that meant that local authorities could claim no grant at all until they had spent a sum equivalent to a 1 per cent. increase in their band D council tax. If they passed that arbitrary and arcane threshold, they could claim only 80p for each pound of cost that they incurred above that limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to be able to inform the Committee that we have abolished that threshold. English local authorities will in future be able to claim up to £230 a week for each family that they accommodate. Authorities in inner London will be able to claim up to £240 a week for each family accommodated before 23 November 1998. That is the date on which we agreed in principle the terms of the grants with colleagues in the local government representative bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third category of asylum seeker covered by the special grant is unaccompanied children. In England there has been a large increase in the number of unaccompanied children and minors seeking asylum, the majority of whom become resident in London. A year ago there were fewer than 600 children in this category. On 19 February there were 1,926. Under part III of the Children Act 1989, local authorities have a responsibility to provide services for children within their area who are deemed to be in need. Therefore, if an unaccompanied asylum-seeking child is in need, an authority has the same duty as it would have for any other child. In the past this grant was also subject to a threshold: an authority had to spend the equivalent of 5 per cent. of its children's standard spending assessment before it qualified to receive any grant, and then the grant was cash-limited. Under the improved terms of this year's grant we have, as for families, removed that unfair threshold and the tight cash limit, which would have been unsustainable, given the large number of unaccompanied minors who have come to this country this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year English local authorities will be able to claim up to £400 per week for each child aged 15 or younger and up to £200 per week for each 16 to 17-year-old. The different rates reflect the fact that children and young teenagers are likely to need residential or foster care, while older teenagers can live in supported lodgings and with greater independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales there are relatively few asylum seekers— around 50 adults and a handful of families and unaccompanied children. They are, in the main,
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
accommodated in Cardiff, Swansea and Newport. Grant will be available to local authorities on the same terms as in England, at an estimated cost of £250,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland, the situation is rather different. That is because, as in Wales, numbers are much smaller than in England, and different legislation is in place. Nevertheless, The special grant report for asylum seeker assistance in Scotland is broadly in line with the English special report. It takes account of the smaller numbers and it has been agreed with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taken together, those elements of this year's special grant represent a settlement that is a great deal fairer to local authorities, and to council tax payers, who will feel with greater confidence that the burden of caring for asylum seekers will not force local authorities to transfer resources away from local services. The removal of the thresholds means that any local authority that provides support for asylum seekers will be able to claim for that support and, even allowing for the substantial increase in the number of asylum seekers, we will spend up to £30 million more than we would have spent under the grant regime that we inherited from the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Committee members will not be surprised to learn that we expect local authorities to live within the fair and realistic terms of the grant. We have, therefore, imposed a cost ceiling of £208.2 million for England, although first indications are that the actual sum claimed will fall comfortably within that figure. The ceiling for Scotland has been set at £1.5 million, reflecting the smaller numbers involved, and that for Wales will be £450,000. If the total amount claimed rises above those ceilings, we will reduce the payment to each authority proportionately. We also expect English local authorities to work with the Home Office to set up voluntary arrangements for the more even distribution of newly arrived asylum seekers around the country. We welcome the co-operation that we have received from the Local Government Association and the Association of London Government on this important initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the grant report is for this year only, and the arrangements will change when the Home Office assumes responsibility for adults and families next year. A year ago my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office, said that we would listen to representations about asylum seekers' grants, We have worked in partnership with local government to meet its concerns and to deal with the substantial increase in the number of asylum seekers who are entering the country. We have improved and simplified the grant formula. In particular, we have removed the unnecessary and unreasonable thresholds and cash limits that our predecessors imposed. I commend the special grant reports to the Commitee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his explanation of the documents. I welcome the increase for local authorities and the principle that he outlined about local people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
not having to bear the burden, in council tax payments, of asylum seekers, whose distribution across the country is far from even.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Significant sums of money are involved. On top of the £208 million for the English grant, which the Minister mentioned, considerable costs are imposed on health and other local services by the presence of large numbers of asylum seekers. That category includes those who will, in time, be determined to be genuine asylum claimants and a much larger number of people whose claims will be rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that our debate would be conducted on consensual grounds, but I am afraid that the Minister resorted to what I now call the inherited shambles gambit, which involves blaming everything on the previous Administration. The truth is that the Government have done nothing to date to discourage bogus asylum seekers from coming to the United Kingdom, although they have talked a pretty tough game. The Minister could usefully take a leaf out of the book of the right hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson), and acknowledge that difficult problems are involved and that no Government have an easy answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that, in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1996, the Government attempted to deal with some of the problems that we all recognise exist in relation to the dramatic increase in the number of asylum seekers entering this country. None of us wants to harm the interests of those people who are genuinely seeking asylum, who are genuinely in fear and who come here to escape persecution. However, as a result of experiences in our constituencies, we are all aware of the large numbers of people who come to this country seeking asylum, who are not, in any conventional sense, at risk of persecution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without wishing to digress too far, Mr. Benton, I have a case in my constituency of someone from Turkey who is seeking asylum in this country. He told me, quite freely, that he had returned to Turkey three times since he arrived here and claimed asylum. According to my simplistic definition of persecution and fear, a person who can return to his country of origin three times in 18 months does not qualify. We all recognise that there are serious problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seem unwilling to confront our European Union partners on some of the more outrageous practices that are taking place, whereby asylum seekers enter the United Kingdom from other European Union countries, unchecked or perhaps even encouraged. Many hon. Members will have read recently in the press about the racket operating at the Gare du Nord in Paris. The French authorities insist on allowing people destined for Calais—and thus not subject to immigration control and not required to show their passports—on to the train, effectively offering an open invitation to anyone who wants to enter the United Kingdom to buy a ticket for Calais and then remain on the train when it goes through the tunnel, by which time it is too late for British immigration officials to do anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
If the Minister wants to attack the actions of the previous Government, he might first consider what this Government have done, in their first nearly two years in office, in order to send the right signals to would-be asylum seekers whose claims are not genuine. In particular, he might want to consider whether the proposed amnesty for up to 30,000 asylum seekers does not represent a significant moral hazard in terms of the signals that it will send to others who are thinking of following them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put two or three specific questions to the Minister. He said that the Scottish provisions were broadly in line with those pertaining in England. I might have missed something, but it seems that, in annex A to the Scottish special grant report, only one single rate of payment is listed—£165 a week. I am sure that that is simply a function of the different arrangements in Scotland for dealing with children, on whose behalf local authorities in England and Wales are able to claim higher payments, but I should be grateful if the Minister would explain how that works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also referred to the returns that local authorities are required to make to his Department by 28 February 1999. He said that early indications showed that the ceiling of £208 million would be more than adequate to meet local authorities' claims. Since all the claims were submitted some 10 days ago, can the Minister be more specific and tell us the total number of claims received from authorities in England under the special grant arrangement? It would be interesting to know how accurately the Department was able to predict the likely uptake of the grant in setting its cash limit. Having set a cash limit, the Department will expect local authorities collectively to live within it. The problem is that they do not know in advance how many people they will have to cater for and will have no control over that number. The Minister said that local services for local people should not suffer because of the presence of asylum seekers, and that local council tax payers should not bear the burden, but if the cost incurred by local authorities rises above £208 million, that is exactly what will happen. My maths is not hot, but if I understand the formula in annexe A, the amount reimbursed to each local authority will be deflated by the percentage of global overspend of all authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to ensure that the total amount claimed falls within the £208 million so that hard-pressed local authorities, which already face pressure on many fronts, do not have to record an under-recovery on this account. That would have a negative effect on local services, local council taxes and, inevitably, good community relations if the presence of asylum seekers were seen to be the cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to future arrangements and the Home Office assuming responsibility for the cost of asylum seekers already in the United Kingdom. Is he saying that the arrangement will be effective from the beginning of the new financial year? Will there be no ongoing provision from existing grants until the Immigration and Asylum Bill is implemented? If there are transitional arrangements for grants to be payable for part or all of the forthcoming financial year, I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0314">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
should be grateful if the Minister would say what they are, what amounts are involved and what increase in the number of asylum seekers underlies the assumptions in setting those grants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak on grants and local authorities in a short contribution because we shall have an opportunity to discuss the wider issues of asylum seekers in the Standing Committee on the Immigration and Asylum Bill to which we are all looking forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Government made a complete mess of the system, particularly the finance and support for local authorities. We must remember that the Immigration and Asylum Act 1996, which was introduced by the previous Government, was a disgraceful attempt to starve people out of the country. The clear intention of the then Government was to provide no support whatever for a group of people who were present in the country whether anyone liked it or not. Fortunately, the courts took a slightly more humane view and overrode the Government's wishes by deciding that the National Assistance Act 1948 applied to asylum seekers. That was a proper judgment by the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), in his assiduousness, picked up many of the points that we wanted to query, particularly in respect of the Scottish settlement. Support for youngsters under 16 is one of the most significant areas of concern and the ludicrous thresholds in the previous settlement caused a lot of tension in many areas where social service budgets for the support of children were already hard pressed. We welcome the fact that that is now recognised in the £400 a week settlement for children under 16 in England, but we question, as did the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, why that is not available for children under 16 in Scotland who will presumably be similarly expensive. I hope that the Minister will be able to satisfy us that Scottish children's social services will not have a problem because they are receiving only £165 instead of £400.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general rejigging of the system is welcome. The Minister may know that we voted against the settlement last year, precisely because we did not feel that it would fully recompense local authorities. We saw it as an important issue of principle that the Government should recompense local authorities for the problem exacerbated by the Government's failure to process claims quickly and effectively, a problem created by previous Governments, who allowed the system to fall into disrepair. However, the problem will not be resolved by the present Government, as they are not making appropriate changes in their immigration and asylum proposals, but are simply continuing what the previous Government did. They are not taking the obvious step of moving back to a benefits-based system of support, but are moving on from the package of support in kind that local authorities are currently providing, and taking that into the Home Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
In respect of next year's settlement, again, like the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, we question at what point the Home Office will take financial responsibility. Will it be from 1 April 1999 or subsequently? Will the Home Office make retrospective payments to local authorities next year or will there be a mixed arrangement for that year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also tell us whether, in introducing the settlements, the Department that he represents has used its expertise to feed into the Home Office its experience of how much is required for asylum seekers? Is he content that the amounts in the reports represent the true costs of supporting asylum seekers, so that they link into the new system, or does he believe that the amounts are above or below what is required? Are they a best guess or do they approximate to the amount required?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point in respect of our support for or opposition to the proposals relates to the critical issue of the capping. The formula seems to work like a creditor's formula where one gets 80p or 90p in the pound depending on the total amount required. Therefore, we ask the Minister to give us a further assurance. I was pleased to hear him say in his opening remarks that £208.2 million would comfortably meet the limit in England. He also referred to £1.5 million for Scotland and £450,000 for Wales. I noted, again in his opening remarks, that he thought that the total sum required in Wales was about £250,000. If we set that against the £450,000, it again suggests that the figure will come in comfortably under.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister can give the assurance that, while he has a cap to keep the Treasury happy, he does not expect it to be used, the proposals, as a significant improvement on the previous system, should command the Committee's support and will certainly command mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Evan Harris 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, West and Abingdon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) and I rise to give two welcomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is for the fact that the Minister restricted himself to one "abuse" and no "bogus". I regret the fact that the term "bogus asylum seekers" was reintroduced into the debate by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, because it does no credit to the situation. The Home Secretary has recognised that it is a divisive term. The Minister who carries a health portfolio assiduously, may be new to these debates, but the feeling in the House was that we had moved on from the language of "bogus", although I am not convinced that the language of "abuse" is any better. However, I welcome the tone of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I reiterate the welcome for the Government's recognition of Opposition Members' criticisms in the same debate last year, when we pressed for a vote on this measure. Not only did we oppose the way in which it was done, but the thresholds that had to be passed meant that in local authorities such as Kent, my own in Oxfordshire and many in London, social tensions were created by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
losses to social services budgets, particularly with regard to children's standing spending assessment and housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the cap will not be reached in this round, not only do we welcome the changing of the calculations and the grant dispersal, but I think that the hon. Gentleman will accept that there is less need to disperse asylum seekers, because each local authority will be reimbursed the full cost that it has to bear. One of the Govermment's arguments for increased dispersal of asylum seekers is that local authorities such as Kent and Oxfordshire bear a heavy burden that is not fully recompensed and, therefore, tensions and difficulties are created. The way to solve that is not to disperse asylum seekers away from where they need to be for legal and cultural support but to recompense local authorities. The Government's proposal to disperse asylum seekers and to give them vouchers is social exclusion by legislation. I endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Hallam. The proposals are, however, a significant improvement on last year's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said that the Government were using the "We inherited this shambles" gambit, but he used the "We were not the last Government" counter-gambit. Responsibility for the system that the Government inherited and continued for a year lies with the previous Government. There has been almost universal criticism of the scheme, and we warmly welcome the fact that—at least in terms of the thresholds—we are moving away from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the special grant reports have been warmly received by hon. Members. We welcome the support of the official Opposition and the Liberal Democrats. However, it is important to recognise that we are debating the special grant reports. We can discuss the merits of the Immigration and Asylum Bill in another forum, and I do not intend to waste the Committee's time by encouraging that debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of the comments made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, I make no apology for describing the system that we inherited from his Government as a shambles. Without any hesitation, I can say that that is absolutely accurate. If he were in my position, he would be hard pushed to describe it as anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members made the same three points. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked for an early indication of the possible claims on the amounts that we have made available to support asylum seekers. We must be cautious. I do not want the figure to be regarded as the final word on the matter because we need to check it and to validate the claims, but up to £170 million is likely to be drawn on by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Hon. Members asked what would happen next year. It is difficult to say because we are discussing the special grant report that applies to the existing financial year. However, the support arrangements in the Immigration and Asylum Bill, which allow adults and families to come under the care of the immigration and nationality directorate, will not come into force until April 2000. Adults and families will continue to be supported next year under provisions in the National Assistance Act 1948, the Children Act 1989 and legislation that applies to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not decided on the content of next year's grant. There will have to be discussions with representatives of local authorities and the Treasury. I am afraid that Opposition Members will have to wait and see what those discussions produce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation in Scotland was mentioned, in particular the different amounts that local authorities can claim for children and families. For the sake of administrative simplicity and with the full agreement of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Scottish grant—unlike the English grant—has no child or family unit costs because many fewer children are involved in the asylum regime in Scotland. We have agreed with COSLA an upper limit of £1.5 million. I assure hon. Members that we believe that the figure will be more than adequate to cover the costs of asylum seekers in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's explanation but, if it is simply a case of administrative efficiency because there are relatively few asylum seekers in Scotland, that does not apply to Wales where the number is even smaller?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are also talking about a different legislative framework in Scotland, which was taken into account when we decided on the figures to reflect the need in Scotland. We are hopeful, in respect of England, Scotland and Wales, that the figures agreed with local authority representatives will provide them with full and proper compensation to help them to meet the costs of accommodating asylum seekers.
