	<i>Amendment proposed</i> [
	<i>this day</i>]: No. 774, in page 103, line 27, leave out "and".—[
	<i>Mr. Murphy.</i>]</p>

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also discussing the following amendments: No. 775, in page 103, line 30, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) confer a discretion as to the amount of any charge made under the regulations, subject to specifying a maximum amount;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(d) require library authorities to take such steps as may be specified or described in the regulations for making the amounts of their charges for library facilities known to the public;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(e) make such other incidental provision and such supplemental, consequential and transitional provision as the Minister thinks necessary or expedient; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(f) make different provision for different cases, including different provision in relation to different persons, circumstances or localities".</p></blockquote>
Government amendments Nos. 714 and 715.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 776, in page 104, line 14, leave out subsection (5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. John Gummer)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned at 1 pm, I was suggesting that the Government amendments met the Committee's genuine anxieties, which we share, so I hope that the Opposition will withdraw their amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Acton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much welcome Government amendment No. 714. The Government have trumped my amendment No. 702, which is just as well as it was not selected. Amendment No. 714 allays fears that the Minister for the Arts was being given powers that he did not want. My right hon. Friend and his Department have been highly receptive to representations from the Library Association, which is pleased that amendment No. 714 has been selected as it removes superfluous powers from the Minister for the Arts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young), I am grateful to the Minister for his concessions and I am more than prepared to withdraw the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1144</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 777, in page 103, line 36, leave out paragraph (b).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be just as generous with this amendment. It deals with an issue that has caused tremendous controversy in library circles and concerns library services that are provided by local authorities outside library premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Written materials are at present lent free of charge outside library premises to housebound readers, residents in homes, and people in day centres, play centres, hospitals and prisons. There is a feeling in local government and among the public, that such lendings should not be subject to charge. I hope that the Minister accepts that, for example, the Association of County Councils is in favour of retaining the status quo. The amendment would affect the least powerful people in society—the housebound, the blind and partially sighted and others. I hope that the Minister will give some concession in response to our proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister for the Arts recently said that the Bill ensures:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that no library authority can charge its local residents, workers our students for borrowing books or journals on library premises, or for the use of print or microform materials for reference in the library."</p></blockquote>
That proper provision should be extended to library facilities that are provided outside the premises of a library.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am entirely sympathetic to the feeling behind the amendment. We are in a dilemma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Library authorities sometimes undertake activities that are not an extension of what happens on library premises but which involve them in extra cost and for which it is accepted that others may pay. For example, a prison pays towards the cost of a special library service that is provided by a library authority. The amendment would stop such payments. Although, in that instance, one could argue that the contribution came directly from central government, it would still be a sum that was no longer given to the local authority. That would be a mistake, and I do not believe that that is the Opposition's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other circumstances in which payment might be made. Several private old people's homes might ask their local library service to provide facilities in addition to those that are reasonably available on the rates. The library service might be happy to provide additional services if the private homes pay the extra cost. It is not for the Government to decide that the library service cannot do that. It is a matter for local discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our dilemma is that if we tighten the clause, even by some way other than the amendment—I think that the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) will agree that it is flawed—we shall remove from local authorities a not unreasonable discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Torfaen does not press his amendment to a Division, especially in view of its effect on the prison service. I give a clear undertaking that it is not the Government's intention to charge for normal library services that, for convenience, are provided outside a library. There is no question of encouraging such charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1145</span>
However, it would be a mistake to stop local authorities being paid for services for which they already charge and for which it is reasonable for them to do so. I refer, for example, to the help that libraries get from the prison service for providing special facilities and the charges that libraries make for undertaking extensive services for people who can be expected to contribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause gives local authorities a necessary discretion and is the best balance that we can think of. If we move further towards stopping that discretion, we shall curtail activities that the hon. Member for Torfaen would wish to continue and which are undertaken without any problem. The provision is not meant to be an extension of current practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's reply. The Association of County Councils and those involved with libraries will accept much of what he said. I shall not press the amendment to a Division, but it is important that further discussions should be held between his Department and the association to work out some details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of libraries is changing as technology progresses. In his discussions with library authorities, the Minister will undoubtedly take into account the fact that, as items other than books are now very much part of local authority libraries, perhaps charging should be reconsidered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statement of the Minister for the Arts, which is really incorporated in the Bill, reflects widespread feeling that libraries should essentially be free. I accept that, for example, the prison service should pay local authorities, but the recipient of the book should not be charged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wholly agree with the hon. Member for Torfaen about library books being free. I have some interest as a former publisher, and I feel strongly on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw a clear, distinction between books and other items. I am aware of the advance of technology and I do not deny the validity of the hon. Gentleman's views, but I am anxious that the provision of books and the basic education that they have made available for so many people should continue. That view is made clear in the Bill and elsewhere because is has widespread, almost universal, support. The availability of books has been important to many of us, not only in our own education but in that of our parents and relations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Steinberg 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(City of Durham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that he will include microfilm, microfiche and database facilities? Some libraries use POLIS—the parliamentary on-line information system that is provided by the House of Commons. Will the Minister, in his generosity, make that available, too?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that I was saying the opposite. There are areas for discussion, but I made a clear distinction with books. There is a difference, and I
	<span class='label label-info column'>1146</span>
depart in no way from what my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Arts said in his announcement, which I entirely support. The hon. Member for Torfaen made a particular reference, and I wanted to accede to it, but in the context of what my right hon. Friend said and in the context of my own statement, first, that I am fully committed to the concept of the free borrowing of books from libraries, and secondly, that the nature of books is different from that of anything else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that. Technology is improving week by week, and the printed word could be going out of date. The time may come when people will not borrow a book because they can find the information on microfilm, microfiche and database. The problem will arise as we move in that direction, and perhaps away from books. I gave the example of POLIS in the House of Commons, because some libraries now use it, and people look to it for information. Will there be a charge for that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear in the Bill that there is no charge for consulting microfiche and microfilm. I do not believe that books are out of date, and I, although at one stage I was one of the biggest microfilm/microfiche producers in the country, maintain that it is second best, that the book will continue to be the most available, and that its cultural connection will not be replaced by anything else. Even in this Bill, where we have allowed consultation of microfiche and the others to be in the same category that the hon. Member for Torfaen suggested, I make a personal commitment to the book, which I still believe has qualities that nothing else has. If I may say so, the idea that it will be phased out is culturally abhorrent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree, and no Opposition Member is suggesting that we phase out books, but there could be phasing in of other forms of technological information that are likely to form the basis of libraries. The Conservative-controlled Association of County Councils believes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the widest definition should be given to the basic"—</p></blockquote>
library—
	<br><blockquote><p>"service and that the use of electronic apparatus … should be regarded alongside books as part of that service."</p></blockquote>
I accept that microfiching is included in that and, as years go by, there may be room for further discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is quite specific, because paragraph (b) contains the word "premises". I accept the Minister's undertaking that he will have further discussions with the association and, on that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendments made:</i> No. 714, in page 104, line 15, leave out from beginning to "the" in line 19.</p>

	<p>No. 715, in page 104, line 22, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"() to provide for such a discretion to be exercisable subject to such maximum amount or scale of maximum amounts as may be specified in or determined under the regulations.—[
	<i>Mr. Gummer.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 778, in page 104, line 36, at end insert—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1147</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5B) Before exercising any power to make regulations under this section, the Minister shall consult the relevant local authority associations and such other representatives of local government as appear to him to be concerned".</p></blockquote>
This is about consultation. The need to consult local government representatives before making regulations should be written into the Bill, and that involves the Secretary of State for the Environment. I ask the Minister to clarify the position, because it affects Welsh libraries, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Arts has given repeated assurances that he will consult on any regulations that are proposed. He has already demonstrated his intention by his recent Green Paper consultations, and none of the bodies that has been represented today in various discussions has complained about a lack of consultation. It has been recognised that there has been full consultation, and that is the undertaking that we gave. There will have to be consultation on the differences between Welsh and English libraries, and I give an undertaking that that will be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 122 says that the full costs should be recovered, yet this clause says that it is discretionary and that the full costs need not be recovered. It is ambiguous. Will the Minister clarify that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave an undertaking that we would correct any ambiguity, although I do not accept that there is any ambiguity. All this is permissive. If the Secretary of State gave local authorities a discretionary power to charge for a certain service, it might be necessary for him to say that they could not charge more than the cost of delivering the service. It points to the maximum that can be charged, not the minimum, as the hon. Gentleman feared. If there are legal reasons for clarifying the matter further, we have undertaken to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a book was not available in the Durham library and it had to be got from the British Library, there might be a considerable cost. We do not suggest that the full cost should be passed on to the borrower for getting the book from the British Library.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what we are not saying. We are saying that if it appeared that local authorities intended to charge an unsuitable amount for that service, the Secretary of State should have the power to prevent that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is self-evident to those who read it. Taken with schedule 7, it allows councils to describe themselves in the Welsh language if they so wish. Under the Local Government Act 1972, they have to describe themselves in the English language and they may add Welsh, but they cannot use Welsh alone. This clause allows them to do so, but there is, of course, no compulsion to do so. A later amendment will permit the translation of the Welsh equivalent of mayor and deputy mayor, but unfortunately that amendment is not yet ready. It is a permissive clause which will, I think, be welcome to many Welsh councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister given any thought to what will happen in England and Wales—and in Scotland, as the clause also covers Scotland—if a local authority transfers all its housing stock? A local authority still has an obligation to house the homeless under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977. In those circumstances, according to Department of Environment guidance local authorities are supposed to enter into a contract with landlords for them to take homeless people. What will happen if no landlord will accept them, or if a landlord will, but only for a short time, or, specifically, for less than a period beyond which they would have to issue a statutory tenancy of some sort? If they have temporary housing, but have to leave before one year—at which time they would become eligible for a tenancy—would the Minister regard them as having made themselves homeless intentionally because they have not found anywhere to live? What will happen in both instances, given that the local authority would no longer have housing stock?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. David Trippier)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would have to be made clear when housing that was formerly the property of a local authority was to be transferred to the private sector, whether a private landlord or a housing association, that there must be an undertaking that the local authority will be responsible for the homeless. As the hon. Gentleman said, the Committee realises that the legal responsibility of ensuring that remains with local authorities. The eventuality could not, therefore, arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a local authority had no stock, which is not currently the case, it would have to make some provision because it would have a legal responsibility. Whether it would be in the form of a hostel or some such accommodation I do not know. The position does not have to arise because on transfers, with which we are familiar from 1988 legislation, there would have to be an undertaking that the private landlord or housing association accepted that it had that obligation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I not right in thinking that if the organisation that takes over a local authority's stock runs into trouble, for example, if it goes bankrupt or sells on, as it is entitled to do, and there is no longer a commitment, as there would not necessarily be, a local authority will have to find accommodation, presumably bed and breakfast or a hostel?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the extreme example that the hon. Gentleman gave, that is so. In the negotiations that would take place on the housing transfer, it would be part of the contract to tie in the private landlord
	<span class='label label-info column'>1150</span>
or housing association so that the landlord or association understood that it had a responsibility to house the homeless, because, again, that legal responsibility lies with the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a housing association or private landlord went into liquidation, and there was a get-out clause that neither he nor I can imagine—I accept that that is always possible—the local authority would be obliged to find accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given those circumstances, which I accept will not occur every day, can the Minister assure us that a local authority would not be allowed to declare that people had made themselves homeless intentionally because they had not tried to find alternative accommodation when the private landlord or housing association could keep them only for a certain period? Will the Minister extend the remit of local authorities in a way that would allow them to duck their responsibility by saying, "We housed them. We found a landlord to take them. It was for only three months. The fact that they have again become homeless is their own fault because they did not find anywhere to live. Therefore, they are intentionally homeless."?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under no circumstances could a local authority get out of its legal obligation under current legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to pursue the point because I am not clear about the Minister's guidance. It is not a question of local authorities wishing to avoid their legal obligation; they want to know how to fulfil it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that one way would be through nomination rights. I will give a couple of examples. In the past, when local authorities worked with housing associations, they could enter into agreements on nomination rights, but, under the Housing Act 1980, those conditions were weakened. Local authorities cannot insist on nomination rights, so they cannot necessarily enter into such obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister described what happens on a large-scale transfer of estates. The document on large-scale transfer stated that local authorities could not enter into nomination rights agreements with organisations that take over local authority stock because the Secretary of State did not think it appropriate. The Secretary of State has closed that door.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister tells us that there are firm possibilities with housing associations and the organisations that carry out large-scale transfers, there may be a change of local authorities fulfilling their statutory obligations to house the homeless. If he does not, the alternatives are as he stated. Some authorities are considering the sale of all their stock. The options are either hostels or bed and breakfast—short-term temporary accommodation. I thought that during discussions on the 1988 Bill and recently we agreed that it was more expensive to provide short-term bed-and-breakfast and hostel accommodation than long-term housing, which could even include the cost of building houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no difference of opinion between us. I have said publicly, especially on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1151</span>
Floor of the House, that bed-and-breakfast accommodation is the most expensive. The hon. Gentleman began by referring to the comments of his hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley), who thought that an irresponsible local authority, controlled by we know not whom—it is pure conjecture on his part—might wish to avoid its legal responsibilities. I tried to answer that. He was talking of the 1988 legislation and of either large-scale voluntary transfers that are not subject to the 1988 Act, but with which we are all familiar, or tenants' choice. The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) is familiar with obligations placed on approved social landlords by the Housing Corporation, and in those cases that would apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are talking of circumstances that fall into neither the category of large-scale voluntary transfers, nor the category of compliance with part IV of the 1988 Act, namely, tenants' choice, I cannot see how the problem could arise. In the case that the hon. Gentleman cited, the Secretary of State would allow nomination arrangements for the homeless. That has always been so. I stand by what I said. There is legal obligation on local authorities. No-one else could carry out the local authorities legal obligation to discharge their responsibilities to the homeless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is to delete the requirement that local authorities should have regard to rents in the private sector when they set their rents. There have been exchanges in Committee about what the words "affordable" and "reasonable" mean when applied to rents. The consultation paper published in July 1988 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Rents generally should not exceed levels within the reach of people in low-paid employment, and in practice they will frequently be below market levels. They should, however, be set by reference to these two parameters: what people can pay, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>1152</span>
what the property is worth, rather than by reference to historic cost accounting figures."</p></blockquote>
The key question still unanswered after hours in Committee is what the phrase, "within reach of people in low-paid employment" means. Fifty per cent. of tenants receive housing rebate. They could not afford to pay more reasonable rents. The Government will put an additional strain on the benefits system, if the benefits system is guaranteed to cover the rents. The Minister must spell out what he means by the phrase, "within the reach of people in low-paid employment".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not rehearse our previous arguments. The Minister gave the helpful example of a balance: on one side were management and maintenance costs and on the other rents. They were balanced against servicing debt. That was how the historic cost-rent setting was established. In practice—I refer to a point made earlier by the Minister for Local Government—the Government bring pressure to bear on council rents and force them up by withdrawing housing subsidy. As a result, most councils receiving housing subsidy have been forced to increase their rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At what level does the Minister think that the rent should be set? Is it intended that council rent levels should rise to be on a par with those in the private sector? Will the Minister confirm what the Secretary of State for the Environment said three years ago, that everyone in Britain should pay at least £35 a week rent? That figure has not been referred to since then. Is that what the Government have in mind? The Minister must spell out where rents are going so that people are clear about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard the Minister on the radio today. Sometimes I wake up in the morning and hope to drift further into wakefulness through a light dream. Sadly, this morning, I flicked on the radio and thought, "My God, I have woken up to a nightmare." It was the Minister talking about the company Ingham and Bullock that is buying all the houses in Burnley. I was tempted to ring in and ask when they will be prevented from collecting houses because they have too many and the Government believe that collecting too many houses is bad. The Minister did not say what the rent levels were.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not have to because Brian Redhead did. I believe that he said £37 a week, which I did not think was too bad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may come as a surprise to the Minister's constituents who pay much less rent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where did the hon. Gentleman get his information? My information was about the average rent in Burnley. Does the hon. Gentleman know Burnley better than I do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may like to tell us what the council rents are in Burnley. I shall be surprised
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1153</span>
if they are £37 a week. The average council rent is between £26 and £30. The Burnley rents that the Minister quoted are well above that figure, and that may be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some local authority rents in Burnley exceed £37 a week. The hon. Gentleman should leave the point and move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to move on, but my next point is that rents may vary as between properties and areas. They may vary as between a three-bedroom flat with central heating and a bedsitter or a one-bedroom flat. The local authority should have discretion to decide what to charge, so that the rent for a house that has been improved is more than the rent for a house that has not had improvements. There should not be an across-the-board rent. That is basic justice, but if the clause is not amended, it will not be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will establish what they believe to be an appropriate rent. When the Minister refers to a reasonable rent, we do not know what he means. He may find it reasonable and be able to afford it—he may believe that it is the general level that everyone should accept. The consultation document referred to ordinary people. I worry about "ordinary people". The Government direct the economy towards "ordinary people", especially in relation to taxes, wages and benefits. They stake it at the average wage, which they say is £258 a week. That is well above the wages of my constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The average might have something to do with the fact that people at the top have had very high increases to pull the average up. The average does not mean that the people at the bottom have those resources. How will the Minister assure us that rents will be within the reach of people in low-paid employment? Higher rents will penalise those who want to be council tenants. If the Minister does not accept the amendment, we will know that he is preparing to price people out of the public rented sector. That is the bottom line. He must say how people in low-paid employment will afford what he describes as reasonable rents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am experiencing deja vu, as are most members of the Committee. The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) may not have been present during a similar debate two weeks ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then I am surprised that we have returned to the same argument and the same speech, although not necessarily from the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley). I gave assurances during the previous debate that I am happy to repeat, but it would save time if hon. Members read the report in 
	<i>Hansard.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No Minister of a Labour or Conservative Government would be so stupid as to say what the reasonable national rent should be. The hon. Gentleman knows as well as I do that rents should
	<span class='label label-info column'>1154</span>
vary between areas. What is appropriate in London would not be appropriate in Leeds or Rossendale. Section 24 of the Housing Act 1985 allows authorities to make such reasonable charges as they may determine for their property and requires them to review the rents from time to time. Authorities have a wide discretion that they want to keep. I say to the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) that it is appropriate that they should have that discretion and he will welcome my saying it. A local authority is in a better position to assess rent levels than a central organisation such as the Government. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurance on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a council is charging rent for a two-bedroomed terraced house that is 60 per cent. of the rent charged for a similar property owned by a private landlord, the rent for a council flat half way up a tower block would also be about 60 per cent. of the rent of a similar private flat. In this context there must be a correlation between what is being charged within the public and private sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 674 seeks to make the consideration of relativities between rents optional. In fact, it is optional now and if clause 129 contained amendment No. 674 it would not be worth the paper it was printed on. Some councils operate objective and fair rent setting mechanisms, but others do not. It is those councils that we wish to encourage to think again. We have no intention of pricing people out of the market. I cannot see how councils could possibly be so encouraged. It would not be fair. I have already given an assurance that we shall start from the position which councils and local authorities find themselves in at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say for the umpteenth time, that it is not our intention to set these rents at anything like market rents. That would be wholly unacceptable. The hon. Member for Leeds, West has heard me say this in the past, so we are going through the same process all over again. I genuinely believe that amendment No. 675 is pointless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal briefly with amendments Nos. 676 and 677 because they are also misplaced. Under clause 65 we discussed the requirement on authorities to budget to avoid a deficit on the housing revenue account. Part of that process will be to consider the need to spend on the housing service and to balance that against the income on the account, including both rents and new housing revenue account subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nicest and most sincere thing I can say about the hon. Member for Leeds, West is that during our discussion on ring-fencing the housing revenue account it was clear to me that he understood it, even if none of his hon. Friends did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's statement, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is not our intention to set these rents at anything like market rents."</p></blockquote>
I invite the Minister to accept amendment No. 677 because the Government's original consultation paper, which was published in July 1988, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Rents generally should not exceed levels within the reach of people in low-paid employment".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1155</span>
Our amendment states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in determining the level of rent a local housing authority shall ensure that it is within the reach of those in low paid employment."</p></blockquote>
We should enshrine in the Bill the phrase that appeared in the original consultation. Although the Minister and Opposition Members may argue about the rent level, locality, geographical distribution and the type of housing, why should we not accept the principle and agree for once that people in low-paid employment should at least be able to afford their rents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The deletion of section 192 of the Housing Act 1985 would remove the powers of local authorities to purchase houses which are found on appeal to be unfit and beyond repair at reasonable expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1159</span>
The clause is extremely worrying because the power represents the last resort of local authorities to make improvements in unfit housing. The 1985 Act defines local authority powers clearly and ensures that, on becoming owners of such properties, local authorities must take steps forthwith to carry out works that would bring the properties up to fitness standards. If the powers are removed, how on earth will local authorities play the role of enablers which the Secretary of State is so keen to ensure they become? Without the power of executive action, the power of repair notices will surely be eroded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 724 would retain for a local housing authority the power to purchase a property which, on appeal from an owner, a court found unfit and unable to be repaired at reasonable expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister answer two questions? First, why are the Government taking this power from local authorities? That is a fair question. What do they propose to put in its place? Secondly, does not the Minister agree that, coupled with the many other proposals in the Bill, the decision will lead to more clearance than rehabilitation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 731 and 735 are probing amendments relating to key changes in the way in which local authorities are to deal with unfit dwellings. Section 206 of the Housing Act 1985 sets the criterion of reasonable expense. To determine that authorities have to weigh up the cost of making a dwelling fit against the value of the premises when made fit, the concept of "reasonable expense" is to be replaced. The authority must instead be satisfied that the action that it takes is the most satisfactory possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In deciding what constitutes "the most satisfactory course of action" authorities shall have regard to such guidance as is from time to time given by the Secretary of State. The guidance has not yet been published. Can the Minister say when it will be published—at least in draft form—to enable us to have full consultations? What will be its status, especially as regards the courts? Will they have to take it more seriously than other guidance, for example that issued under the homeless persons provisions? Do the Government intend the guidance to strengthen or weaken authorities that are due to take action on unfitness? Finally, what will the guidance contain? What should local authorities take into account in deciding the most satisfactory course of action?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of value for money, schedule 8(9) is unacceptable. Does the Minister really expect owners or occupiers of dwellings to carry out repairs if there is no possibility of their being able to do so at reasonable cost which reflects fairly the return expected from the property? This is bound to lead to complex problems for local authorities and is more likely to deter than to enhance effective policies on unfit housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment 752 is to reinstate the power of local authorities to purchase compulsorily property that cannot be repaired at reasonable expense. Previous amendments have attempted to reinstate the "reasonable expense" criterion while making it clear that "reasonable expense" includes
	<span class='label label-info column'>1160</span>
net expense, compared with vacant value. Perhaps the Minister will clarify those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I calculate that the hon. Member for City of Durham (Mr. Steinberg) has put 17 questions to me. He told the Committee that he wished to get to Durham this evening. I must admit that he has chosen an odd way to do so. However, I shall assist him by picking up as many of his questions as I can remember and giving him a number of assurances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 724, 728, 731 and 752 would retain certain elements of the "reasonable expense" test for repair notices. They would merely retain the power of local authorities to purchase property which, on appeal against the repair notice, is found to be capable of being repaired at reasonable expense. As that would no longer be a ground for appeal by virtue of amendments made by paragraph 3 of the schedule, amendments Nos. 724, 728 and 731 would be ineffective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 735 would retain section 321 of the Housing Act 1985, which sets out the matters that must be taken into account in determining whether a property cannot be repaired at reasonable expenses for the purposes of closing and demolition orders. On its own, the provision has no value unless other provisions in the schedule are amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the decision to serve a repair notice in respect of an unfit property rests entirely on whether the property can be repaired, at reasonable expense. If it cannot, a local authority is statutorily obliged to serve a time and place notice, which will lead to the service of a demolition order or closing order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That narrow test precludes local authorities from taking account of wider considerations and is unfairly weighted against properties in areas where property values are low and where the cost of repairs often outstrips the increased value of the improved property. Furthermore, initial values of tenanted properties will be low, but once the tenants have been rehoused in consequence of an order, values may rise to a point where renovation is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 8 replaces the test with a requirement that local authorities take what they consider to be the most satisfactory action, be it repair, closure, demolition or inclusion in a clearance area, having regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State. We expect the guidance to cover not only economic but social factors such as community ties and the best interests of tenants. It will not be easy to draw up the guidance, but I am sure that local authorities will find it helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall discuss a draft with local authority associations. There is provision for it to be laid before Parliament both at the outset and on each occasion that it is revised. Local authorities will therefore be free to consider all the options. Indeed, they will be required to do so. The hon. Member for City of Durham should draw comfort from that consideration. The arrangement is in keeping with the provisions on renewal areas and clearance action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an authority decides that closure or demolition is preferable to repair, it will still have power to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1161</span>
acquire properties for temporary housing accommodation. Similarly, if the owner of a property that is the subject of a repair notice appeals successfully against the notice on the ground that some other course of action should have been taken, the authority may serve a demolition or closing order and use those powers. In renewal areas, there are powers to acquire property for repair and improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of that explanation, I urge the Committee to reject amendments Nos 724, 728, 731, 735 and 752. Government amendment No. 811 is a minor, technical amendment that repeals the reference to section 192 of the Housing Act 1985 in section 608. Section 608 deals with the purposes for which an ancient monument may be acquired. I commend amendment No. 811 to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would retain a local authority's powers to enter a dwelling house in connection with a repairs notice after giving 24 hours' notice of its intention to the occupier. The amendments relate to slum clearance and to houses in multiple occupation. Paragraph 6(1)(a) to part I of schedule 8 proposes to change the period of notice from 24 hours to seven days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members strongly resist the proposal. It is a retrograde and potentially damaging move against tenants of properties owned by landlords, and in particular against bedsit tenants. The proposed change occurs elsewhere in schedule 8—in the period of notice required for entry to inspect a house in multiple occupation or to carry out works there—and it is equally objectionable in all contexts. Where did the suggestion originate? Is it a Department of the Environment or a Home Office proposal? Has the Home Office argued the need to standardise such powers in legislation? That appears to be the only answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Entry to a dwelling house or to a house in multiple occupation is necessary to assess its condition at the time, especially to check whether any offence has been committed, or whether any notice or order is being contravened, such as a closing order, a direction order or a management order. With a repairs notice, section 197 gives the power of entry to survey and
	<span class='label label-info column'>1162</span>
examine premises and to check whether a notice has been acted on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We resist this part of the Bill and have tabled the amendment to safeguard vulnerable tenants. It is beyond belief that a draftsman, irrespective of whether he is from the Home Office or from the Department of the Environment, cannot grasp the effects of the proposed change. Surely anyone can see that seven days' notice would enable an unscrupulous landlord to remove the occupiers, empty the building and do all manner of things to avoid compliance with a local authority enforcement action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 395 of the Housing Act 1985 deals primarily with houses in multiple occupation. Where the safety and health of occupants is involved it is even more essential that local authorities are empowered to act quickly. The need to enter a property under this section is likely to arise as a result of a total lack of co-operation from landlords who want to make a fast buck. The local authority must have powers to control such activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain why the provisions are needed? Surely it is in everyone's interests to deal with the problems of disrepair as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it incredibly confusing that, when we discussed powers of entry only last week, the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) argued that seven days was not long enough but now it seems that the Opposition are arguing for a return to 24 hours. It is important that I make it clear to the Committee that the criteria set for the powers of entry are principally the responsibility of the Home Office, not of the Department of the Environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill makes the requirements on rules of entry consistent with those in other legislation. Modern thinking on such powers of entry is that the authority that wants to enter the property should give reasonable notice to the occupier and owner of its intentions when the purpose of entry is principally to satisfy the authority about certain facts relating to the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That condition is relevant to the power of entry under sections 197 and 319, where the authority needs to ascertain whether works have started as required by notice or to carry out surveys to see whether works are necessary. These requirements do not demand a swoop by a local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers of entry under section 395 are rather different. In that regard only, I accept that the argument of the hon. Member for City of Durham for 24 hours' notice is more compelling and convincing. Section 395 enables an environmental health officer to use his powers of entry where he suspects that certain requirements under part XI of the Act are not being complied with. Some of these are not dissimilar from the matters that officers investigate using powers of entry under sections 197 and 319—non-compliance with a works notice or with management regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other circumstances demand that an environmental health officer should be able to swoop. It is as clear to the hon. Member for City of Durham as it is to me that if an environmental health officer
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1163</span>
who suspects overcrowding gives seven days' notice of his intention to visit, by the time the inspector arrives at the premises, they will no longer be overcrowded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am persuaded that there is a good case for a 24-hour notice period in respect of section 395. If the hon. Member for City of Durham withdraws amendment No. 740, which has a small drafting defect, I undertake to introduce a Government amendment at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that, for those reasons, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 725 and 734.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steinberg</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am flabbergasted. We thought the problem was the Home Office and that the Minister's Department would show more sense.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 726 would be to retain the present offence" under section 198 of the Housing Act 1985 of obstructing an officer of the local housing authority or an officer of the Secretary of State from entering premises to carry out any responsibilities under part VI of the 1985 Act, which relates to repair notices. The offence carries a penalty of a maximum fine at level 2 of £100. Paragraph 7 of schedule 8 proposes to qualify obstruction by making it necessary to prove that it was done intentionally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of amendment No. 742 would be to retain the present offence under section 396 of the Housing Act 1985 of obstructing an officer of the local housing authority from entering premises to carry out any responsibilities under Part XI, which relates to houses in multiple occupation. The offence carries a penalty of a maximum fine at level 2 of £100. Paragraph 45(1) of schedule 8 proposes to qualify obstruction by making it necessary to prove that it was done intentionally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a criminal offence to obstruct an officer of a local authority when exercising power of entry under section 197 of the 1985 Act. The introduction of the word "intentionally" will make the power virtually impossible for local authorities to enforce. The burden of proof that action was carried out intentionally will rest with the local authority and that will make it difficult for an authority to carry out its duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens if an occupier or owner is physically incapable of meeting the requirements of a notice of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1164</span>
entry? There is a danger that his actions will be deemed intentional. The greater danger in a case of the rogue landlord is that intentional avoidance could easily be dressed up as unintentional. In both cases, it is notoriously difficult to prove intent and there is little doubt that the provision would lead to wasteful litigation. The authority would have to prove to the court beyond reasonable doubt that the accused's intention was to obstruct, and at the end the penalty is not a substantial one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will look at this again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but on this occasion I must ask the Committee to reject the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in schedule 8 that the amendments attempt to remove have the effect of making the offence of obstructing an officer under sections 198 and 396 of the 1985 Act that of intentionally obstructing him. Hon. Members will know that on matters connected with the construction of offences, my Department is advised by the Home Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that it is now the practice in constructing offences of this sort that the offence should be one of intentional obstruction. The officers who use the powers in parts VI and XI of the Housing Act 1985 may be concerned that this will lead to all sorts of arguments in court about whether a particular incidence of obstruction was intentional. However, it is clearly wrong that someone who had no intention of obstructing an officer should be convicted of a criminal offence under sections 198 or 396.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bewildered, or merely surprised, tenant who may get in an officer's way is not in the same category as, for example the landlord's agent who actively tries to prevent him from doing his duty. The offence, as reworded, enable the courts to distinguish between the two sorts of obstruction and to penalise accordingly.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may reply that we are in danger of going over ground that we covered when he was not present during the Committee debates on the Housing Act 988. I remind him that we spent many hours on what now may be described as the famous Ground 6 of schedule 2 of the Housing Act 1988. If the Minister reads the 
	<i>Hansard</i> of that Standing Committee he will see that his predecessor gave warm indications that he sympathised with our view about Ground 6 which merely suggests that landlords of assured tenancies can apply for a notice of possession if they intend to carry out substantial repair works to their properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The former Minister thought that the clause was so vague that if a landlord wanted to improve his property he had the key clause and condition with which to carry out a mandatory repossession. It was thought that that was harsh. I know that the former Minister has moved on to the Foreign Office and, perhaps, it will be the fate of this Minister to be elevated to the Foreign Office if he accepts our amendment, which I hope he does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assured tenancy scheme came into operation only on 15 January 1989, so we have not had the space or time to provide evidence. I remember that I argued with the Minister and asked, "How on earth do you define substantial repair?". If a landlord says that I rent his front room and he wants to do up the passage and the back of the house, he could have me evicted from that front room because he did not like the look of me. In those circumstances, the former Minister thought that the clause was too harsh, but that measure is still in the schedule to the 1988 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is the core of the issue. A tenant may be afraid to go to the council to get a notice served on his landlord because his landlord could use that for Ground 6.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that our intention is to prevent a person who lives in a house in multiple occupation from being thrown out of the property when a statutory notice is issued? I am in the hands of the Minister and would welcome his advice on whether the measure is drawn tightly enough to prevent that. My memory may not serve me well enough, but if he can give me a cast-iron assurance I shall withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no memory of the 1988 Bill and rely to a degree on the hon. Gentleman's memory of it, which I believe is good because he spoke with such authority on other amendments and was correct. Ground 6 requires redevelopment, not repairs. The hon. Gentleman is talking about repairs. There is a significant difference when the subject is houses in multiple occupation. The landlord would have to meet all the other requirements in that ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the row.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand. That was the nub of the discussion. I shall explain why we believe that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1062">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1167</span>
the amendments are unnecessary and if the hon. Gentleman is not satisfied, the Committee should divide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parts VI and XI of the Housing Act 1985 are concerned with the repair of property to make it fit for people who may live in it. Ground 6 in schedule 2 of the Housing Act 1988 enables a landlord who wants to redevelop his property to gain possession if he can prove his case in court. The terms of a local authority's repair notice may be so extensive that in effect it requires the landlord to redevelop the property. The fact that the notice has been served will not in itself require the court to give the landlord possession under Ground 6. The landlord would have to prove his case to the court. He would have to prove that he had not acquired the property with sitting tenants and that he could not do the work around the tenants. The presence of a repair notice might be evidence of a landlord's need to redevelop, but the landlord would still have to meet all the ground's requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, Ground 6 is complicated and tightly drawn and a landlord who relies on the fact that a local authority has served a part VI or part XI notice will not prove his case for possession in that way.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is assuring me that a landlord cannot use a notice for repair work.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 732, in page 151, line 38, after "lessee", insert "tenant, lawful occupier,".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment simply asks the Minister to consult the people who live in the areas where clearance notices are served. I warmly welcome most of the Government's amendments to part II and the procedures for declaring a clearance area, but it is clear that the list of people whom the Government assume have an interest is restricted. Freeholders are to be informed, as are lessees and mortgagees, but what about occupiers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1168</span>
I merely seek clarification. What is the Government's purpose in including lessees? Does that mean long leaseholders only? Are contractual tenants included? What about statutory tenants and assured tenants? They should all be included, because they are all affected by any proposals to clear an area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that is not the general pattern for development. The present tendency is to look at redevelopment, pepper-potting, improvements and renewal policies. When the policy involves clearance, all the people who live in the area should have a right to be informed about the proposals, as well as a right to express their views on them. There should be consultation with everyone in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example. If a property owned by a local authority is declared unfit, and the authority is unable to improve it because of a lack of funds, it may be handed over to a short-life group. We spoke earlier about the use of short-life properties, which the Government support. It is important to ensure that properties do not become vacant and unused. Surely, therefore, short-life groups that use properties for up to six months of the year should be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Short-life groups?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes—short-life groups, because the consequences of declaring a clearance area can be drastic. I realise that it is a rare practice, but people in the local community affected by the demolition are not consulted, and they should have a right to be consulted, whether they are owner-occupiers, tenants or licensees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not delay the Committee long, because I am sure that the hon. Member for Leeds, West knows that we entirely accept the spirit of what he says. We fully intend to consult those people who lawfully occupy the building, but more precisely, those who have a financial stake in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I went along with the hon. Gentleman until he blew it. He was talking about short-life groups, but I am not quite sure what short-life groups are. Are they squatters? I have no intention of consulting squatters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in difficulty again, Mr. Hunt, because I cannot refer the Minister to his civil servants, advisers or whoever in this Room inspires him. Short-life properties are a common term in housing, and they do not involve squatters. I see that the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young) is smiling. It is normal practice in clearance areas. Groups move into properties in clearance areas for a certain time. The difficulty arises when the clearance does not take place for a number of years. They may be called short-life groups, but if the demolition or procedures take longer than expected, they could be in the properties for up to 10 years, so short-life is something of a misnomer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly those people are not living in properties illegally, as the Minister suggested. They are perfectly honourable occupants of the properties and they should be included in the general consultation package.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important amendment which would substantially change the legislation by replacing section 352(1) of the Housing Act 1985. The amendment would do something about the standards of houses in multiple occupancy and the fitness of those properties. We are trying to establish a more comprehensive standard of fitness and suitability for HMOs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment requires HMOs to be structurally stable, free from serious disrepair and free from
	<span class='label label-info column'>1172</span>
damp. There should be satisfactory provision for natural and artificial lighting, including the lighting of common areas. There should be satisfactory provision for ventilation, satisfactory provision for heating for each letting and for the common parts, and satisfactory thermal and sound insulation. Most importantly, such houses should be provided with a means of detecting fire, an adequate fire warning system, and a satisfactory means of escape in case of fire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, today got off to a bad start with a nightmare, and it got worse. I got the tube to come here and saw a young man handing out the advertising magazine 
	<i>Midweek.</i> I flicked through its pages and saw an article about conditions for hotel workers in London who do not live in the hotels in which they work. That article says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At a four-star, 900 bedroom hotel's old staff hostel in Earls Court Square, sparks used to leap out from behind the TV, fire extinguishers were empty or missing, one fire door opened the wrong way while others didn't close at all.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Although nearly £2 million was being spent on its guest bedrooms, urgent repairs to the hostel's facade and staircase were not done. The bar had been closed, taxis to and from hotel had cancelled and three residents who shared a room had only one plug socket between them.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>When fire swept through the hostel in 1987, the only surprise was that only one of the 100 or so residents died."</p></blockquote>
Fire in houses in multiple occupancy is a serious issue which we should be prepared to tackle. There is an opportunity to do so today in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's proposed reforms for the fitness standards of dwelling houses and the introduction of additional standards for flats leaves standards for multiple occupancy housing in a confused position. The amendment would set out comprehensive, improved standards for houses in multiple occupancy, in line with the general approach of schedule 8 part IV.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department has said that it intends to introduce a fitness standard for houses in multiple occupancy, but so far no amendments to that effect have been tabled. There have been attempts in private Member's Bills and other legislation to attach those standards and conditions to housing legislation to tackle the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope to replace section 352(1) of the Housing Act 1985 with a detailed fitness standard which the local authority would be required to enforce. The authority should take account of the number of individuals and households accommodated in the multiple occupancy housing when it decides whether the provision makes the house reasonably suitable for occupation. That principle is based on the 1985 Act which decides the number of shared facilities required in multiple occupancy housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are offering a standard that is more comprehensive than that for dwelling houses or flats. It must be more comprehensive because houses in multiple occupancy are more densely occupied, which is why tenants can have more problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1987 research by the Department of the Environment on multiple occupancy housing found that 81 per cent. lacked a satisfactory means of escape in case of fire. Amendment No. 736 does not limit
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1173</span>
fire safety only to means of escape but also covers fire detection. I hope that I shall not be able to read in a few years time, articles in magazines such as 
	<i>Midweek</i> which suggest that people die in fires in grossly overcrowded housing, because we can tackle that problem now. I hope that the Minister is as sympathetic to this substantial amendment as he was to previous ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The purpose of the amendment is to insist that there should be a registration scheme. There is no reason why it cannot go ahead even though we are waiting for legislation from the other place. It would enable local housing authorities to set up registration for HMOs. At present, about 70 local authorities have such schemes although, according to the consultation document published by the Department of the Environment in July last year, over a third have not been operating. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Department believes that authorities would be more prepared to go to the expense of setting up a scheme if they could recover their costs by charging a fee. Landlords are more likely to treat seriously a function for which they have to pay a fee … The level of fee will be left to the discretion of the local authority but it is envisaged that charging would cover the costs of the registration scheme itself, not additional activity on HMOs".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would put the Department's proposal into effect, so we hope that we have been helpful by tabling it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the fact that in its consultation document, the Department of the Environment proposed that authorities should be able to charge a registration fee, which would cover the costs of running the registration scheme. The idea was received favourably. Clause 121 gives the Secretary of State power to make regulations, provided that charges may be made by local authorities in respect of functions that fall within their prescribed description. That power will enable us to empower local authorities to charge a fee for registration. The details of the costs that the registration fee would cover would be prescribed in the regulations, which are subject to the affirmative resolution. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will acknowledge that we have provided the appropriate power and that the amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Department of the Environment proposed that the level of the fee would be left to the discretion of the local authority, but the Minister said that it would be set by the Secretary of State.

I share the views of Opposition Members that we must do everything possible to improve fitness standards in dwellings, but nothing has been left out of the amendments, short of gold taps. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on that. Everything has been covered. It is unbelievable. The new habitation standard would mean that a far greater number of properties—perhaps three or four times as many—would be classified as unfit for human habitation. Many more people would be aware that their homes failed the standard, but they would have no assurance that the authority intended to do anything about it or, if it did, what assistance would be available.

Amendment No. 751 would exclude from the Bill the power to enable the Secretary of State to amend or supplement the proposed new fitness standard. It is difficult to see why the Opposition should oppose that. It means that, in the light of experience, we can include other factors in the standard without primary legislation. Of course, it means that we can also exclude factors even though we have no plans to do so. I should have expected Opposition Members to welcome that, even if it means fewer mandatory grants, as they argued on Tuesday. I am sorry to give that reply to the hon. Gentleman.

Amendment No. 751 is about the powers of the Secretary of State. It was stated this morning that the Secretary of State's powers are being far more widely defined in this Bill than in previous Bills.

Deciding what property is fit and what is unfit should not be left to discretion. The Secretary of State could decide at a whim and that would have an effect on the value of the property.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might be luckier on this occasion. The amendment again refers to the test of fitness and additional matters that should have been considered in that test. It asks whether the access to the building should be included in the definition of fitness of residential properties. Safe access, especially in large cities and London, should be an essential part of the fitness standards of a residential dwelling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 745 refers to adequate means of escape from fire as a standard by which to decide whether a house is fit. In large cities, where there is increasing use of new security measures and double glazing, adequate exit in the event of fire should be part of fitness.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to say that I can be a little more generous on amendment No. 744 because I can prove the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) that we have met his fears. Amendments. No. 744 and 745 relate to the fitness standards that apply to common parts of blocks of flats. In our view, it would be possible for an authority to conclude that the condition of the stairs or other means of access within the building constituted serious disrepair, and to that extent the Bill contains provision. Amendment No. 744 is therefore unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 745 would require local authorities to insist that all blocks of flats, whatever their size and age, should have adequate means of escape from fire. On the face of it, that sounds a reasonable objective, but it is unreasonable to require it as part of the fitness standards for common parts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1182</span>
Purpose-built blocks of flats are already covered adequately by the Building Act 1984. New or substantially converted blocks are covered by the building regulations. Some buildings converted into flats might fall within the definition of houses in multiple occupation. We propose that adequate means of escape from fire should be part of the new fitness standard applicable to houses in multiple occupation, which is where we need to concentrate resources and enforcement action. I am sure that all members of the Committee agree with that objective.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seem to recall that the 1979 Conservative manifesto contained about 50 words on housing policy, to the effect that it was this brand-new Government's intention to make Britain the best housed nation in Europe. It did not say that we would have better or improved housing, but the best, so I was slightly surprised that the Minister's response to my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy), who clearly outlined what the objective entailed, went back on that commitment. I was reminded of the commitment on child benefit, when the Government said, "We'll keep to it as of now," and we later discovered that it would be frozen. Now we are freezing housing conditions as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Be that as it may, we should welcome the Government's attempt to bring the concept of fitness up to date in the schedule, although we should question the standards that they are using. In particular, the fact that the Secretary of State, not local authorities, seems able to decide what the concept means, could cause difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 747 and return to the others later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1183</span>
If, in deciding a property's fitness, local authorities must choose between a repair order, a closing order or demolition, their powers to deal with unfit housing must be plain. The schedule attempts to update the definition of unfit housing, but it provides that in deciding the most satisfactory course and choosing one of those three options, local authorities must have regard to the Secretary of State's guidance. The guidance might in fact be compiled by the Under-Secretary of State or by the Minister for Local Government and Housing. When I tried to explain to the right hon. Gentleman about damp conditions and people without heating, he said that elderly people should wear woolly jumpers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give way. That was a mild jibe and I withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend said no such thing. He said that he wore a woolly jumper. He did not recommend that everyone else should wear one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Under-Secretary of State wishes he can check the record. I shall not go into detail, but the Minister clearly advocated that policy to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need slightly better guidelines than Secretary of State's impression. I grant that the Under-Secretary of State knows something about housing conditions and the Minister for Local Government is at least prepared to discuss housing conditions and damp, albeit that he sees a choice between central heating and Arranwear. However, the decision on what is unfit housing may not be made by the Under-Secretary of State or by the Minister, but by the Secretary of State. We must be plain what the guidance will contain. What will happen to an unfit house? Will it be demolished, subject to a closing order, used for human habitation or repaired?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The views of tenants or lawful occupants should be considered. At present, if a local authority considers that a property can be repaired at reasonable expense it serves a repair order. If a local authority decides that it cannot repair at reasonable expense it holds a time and place meeting to discuss the future of the property. The owner and the landlord are invited but tenants are not, even if they have lived there for 20 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suggest that there should be full consultation. Amendment No. 747 would redress the problem and allow the views of lawful occupants to be taken into account in deciding what happens to a house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 746, under the current arrangements, once a local authority has ruled that a property is unfit it must decide whether to repair it at reasonable expense. The process of deciding whether a property can be repaired or brought up to fitness standards is difficult and can involve a great deal of litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a local authority has held a meeting at which the owner gives firm undertakings to do the work even though it cannot be done at reasonable expense, the authority can accept the cost argument and serve a closing order to the effect that the property is not fit for human habitation. The authority has the power to use discretion at local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1184</span>
The new, amended procedure in the schedule changes the basis on which a local authority decides which course of action to take. Under the old procedure a local authority decided whether a property could be repaired at reasonable expense and went from there. Under the new procedure a local authority must be happy that its chosen course of action is the most satisfactory one, having regard to the Secretary of State's guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to ask what the guidance will be. What is wrong with the approach in the Housing Act 1985? Environmental health departments throughout the country have lived and worked with it. The Minister must give genuine reasons for changing the procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Minister could give us an inkling of what the guidance will be. What physical factors will local authorities be expected to take into account when deciding the most satisfactory course of action? Will they include the cost of repair, the value of the property, its value vacant or tenanted and the landlord's management costs or profits? What social factors will be taken into account? What will the level of consultation be? In particular, what will be the status of the regulations when they are subject to appeal on individual cases by landlords?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If provision remains in the schedule, the Secretary of State will spend much of his time going round the country. He may end up carrying out inspections himself. As we all know, there are endless rows when notices are served for repairs. Landlords say that they cannot do them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a practical example. An elderly woman lived in a room below ground level, with no decent light. A notice was served on that property and the landlord was told either to improve the whole property and offer her somewhere decent, or a closing order would be served on it. He did nothing, so the closing order was served on it. He then said that he would come back with repairs. The reason was that the roof in the place was classified as too low under present standards. Even though the flat was underground and the floor was set at soil level, the landlord said that he would somehow invent a mythical system of lowering the floor, to enable her to get in by dropping the steps. When a landlord comes along with his lawyer to say that he is holding up the order, it can take months of litigation to sort out the matter. I do not believe that it will be the job of the Secretary of State for the Environment to wander round the country, carrying out inspections himself at the invitation of landlords who seek to hold up notices. The Minister should make it clear to the Committee now how the Secretary of State intends to use the power that he seems to think he needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first thing I should tell the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) is that we have not yet published the guidance. We would not be so arrogant as to assume that we knew exactly how we should prepare it, which is why we have decided to consult local authority associations. No doubt much if not all of what he said should be incorporated in that guidance note.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1185</span>
My difficulty with amendment No. 746 is that many local authorities would not wish it to go ahead, as it is too constraining. It could mean that, if the priority was on financial factors, in areas where property values are depressed demolition would be the only option. Therefore, I ask him to withdraw that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 747 imposes a requirement on local authorities to have regard to the representations of the owner or occupying tenant of the property. No doubt local authorities will continue with their present practice of informal negotiation before serving notices, and thus will be aware of the views of owners and occupants. Where a clearance area is concerned, they would be obliged to take any representations into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appeal system will continue to operate in respect of individual properties. In those circumstances, it is right that the court should determine the matters in dispute. I cannot accept that local authorities should have a statutory obligation to have regard to individual representations, when adequate protection is already afforded by other provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the hon. Gentleman would expect me to reply at length to amendment No. 748 because we have been round this track of the Secretary of State's powers about 17 times during our four sittings this week. On Tuesday we discussed at length provisions on different guidance in respect of different areas. I handled that debate and the hon. Gentleman participated in it and there was not much of a meeting point on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I cannot understand why the hon. Members for Leeds, West and for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) should wish to press amendments Nos. 749 and 750, because they would remove the requirements for parliamentary procedure. The courts will be required to take into account any guidance issued in determining an appeal against a repair notice, or demolition, or closing order, so the guidance has a statutory force and it is proper that it be scrutinised carefully before it is issued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contrary to what the hon. Member for Leeds, West was suggesting, far from diminishing the powers of local authorities to decide what is best for unfit property, we are providing more freedom for them to operate within a basic framework to secure consistency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The part of the Minister's reply that slightly worries me concerns serving notices. Experience tells me that most negotiation goes on after, not before, notices have been served. The difficulty arises because people challenge the notices and that leads to litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to get the position clear. As I understand it, the guidance will go into the regulations and have statutory force. What will be the status of the regulations in respect of appeal by landlords? Will those regulations be subject to appeal by individual landlords? If so, Marsham street will have to extend its premises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been something of a strange day. I awoke this morning to the dulcet tones of the Minister telling us that he would do for housing what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1187</span>
Genghis Khan and his hordes for civilisation. That is not the nicest way to wake up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that it would be a bad day, but I have been pleasantly surprised. I do not know whether someone has put something in the Minister's water, but we have got far more than we expected, although perhaps not as much as I should have liked. The Government have moved today on several matters, including charges, in a way that the Opposition had not expected. We are pleased about that. We seem to have achieved more in today's Committee than I expected and more than we have achieved in all the other days put together, but I should need to do my homework before I could confirm that statistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a slightly different part of the Bill and I think that I can see how the Minister will move towards the position taken by the Opposition and by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir George Young), whose amendment No. 556 is grouped with ours. We shall support the hon. Gentleman's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 131 gives local authorities the power to finance housing associations in the provision of services and maintenance. We are happy about that, but we are anxious because the term housing association is not defined. Unless the term is defined, there could be problems when the Bill is enacted. Our amendment will correct the clause by limiting the "housing association" mentioned in subsection 3(a) to the definition contained in the Housing Associations Act 1985. That ties in neatly with the Government's existing legislation. In effect, it means that a company could not call itself a housing association if it traded for profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other week I cited an example of what I fear will become increasingly common. It occurs when a company sees the advantages of the business expansion scheme and converts a non-residential property within the five-year tax holiday and, as a result, obtains a major tax concession of up to £5 million. All that it need do is to convert that property into accommodation. I have since received information that the company involved in the case that I cited wanted to convert a property into three and four-bedroom flats and then it explicitly stated that at the end of the tax holiday period it would seek permission to convert them into one-bedroom flats—that permission is easy enough to obtain. The company then added—in brackets—that carrying out major renovation and structural work on the flats was ground for compulsory acquisition by the landlord. In other words, they could get the tenants out by converting from three and four-bedroom to one-bedroom flats. They could then sell at the end of that period—and probably with vacant possession to obtain maximum gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us then consider the position if that company sees the advantages of doing that with local authority finance and changes its name to, say, the Kingfisher housing association. I hope that no such association exists, but if one does I mean it no harm. The company would get the Government's tax take and it would be eligible to receive money from the local authority. I hope that the Minister will accept the tighter definition that is in the Housing Associations Act 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1188</span>
The amendments also cover the wide range of services for repairs and maintenance which we think should be offered to both owners and occupiers. Our view is that the Government lack imagination on this aspect of housing. We should allow housing associations and local authorities to offer help to elderly owner-occupiers who find it increasingly difficult to manage their property. They are anxious about the problem of raising money to repair the property and about who will do it. They fear being ripped off by a bad builder. On top of that—this is where we differ from the Government—it is in everyone's interest if housing is maintained as a national asset. That requires public spending. However, the Government see housing as a personal matter and leave it to the individual to sort out. That is short-sighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 679 will ensure that public money is not given to private companies, but I have dealt with that point in my remarks. I hope that the Minister will move towards us in ensuring that the definition of a housing association is tightened. He may not agree with much else that I have said, but the argument for that is clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to amendment No. 556, which stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young). I welcome the support of the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) for the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 131 gives local authorities powers to provide precisely the type of advice, assistance and practical help given by the National Home Improvement Council in neighbourhood revitalisation scheme areas. This is a helpful addition to the Bill and puts the provision of advisory services by a local authority or other body firmly on the map.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 556 would be a useful addition because the NHIC does not fit readily into the organisations mentioned in subsection (3), apart from the cover-all in paragraph (c). It may be thought unusual to stipulate paticular bodies in legislation in the way that the amendment suggests. But in similar circumstances in the Consumer Credit (Exempt Agreements) (No. 2) (Amendment) Order 1988 the NHIC was listed by name to avoid possible problems in the future. A similar solution could be adopted in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NHIC believes that it is essential that Ministers use every available way of encouraging local authorities to take up the powers given by the clause, or allow others to do so on their behalf. Positive guidance should be offered by the Department of the Environment in detailing the type of services and body that the Secretary of State would approve. That is essential if this welcome initiative is to flourish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that my hon. Friend the Minister will agree that providing timely advice and assistance in a community is a proven way of tackling areas of poor housing in an extremely cost-effective way. That approach can change the face of whole communities, instilling a neighbourhood spirit and a sense of community benefit to all, particularly among aged and disadvantaged people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I yield to no one in my admiration for the National Home Improvement Council, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Waller) referred, and particularly for the work that it does in its neighbourhood revitalisation services. But other worthy organisations should be included, too. My hon. Friend said that that was covered by subsection (3)(c), and I suggest that that is how it should remain. If we include the NHIC, we should consider including PROBE—Partnership for the Renewal of the Built Environment—or Bellway Urban Renewal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fascinating that the amendment has been tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young). As he is a director of PROBE, one wonders why he did not specify PROBE and get some deserving publicity for it. We should not itemise one worthy organisation like that, because we could land in all sorts of trouble. I am glad that the hon. Member for Leeds, West agrees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have good news and bad news for the hon. Member for Hammersmith. I am grateful for what he said about the way in which I and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government treated him, despite the fact that he had a rude awakening this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, let me deal with the bad news, because I like always to end on a high. I cannot accept amendment No. 679 because it would restrict financial assistance to non-profit making bodies and that would be sad. The object of providing financial assistance is to provide a service that benefits householders in the area. A private profit-making body may be judged to be the most cost-effective way of securing such renewal and improvement. If that is so, I believe that it should not be prevented by the withholding of financial assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 678 provides a definition of housing associations which includes the offshoots that some of them established before the Housing and Planning Act 1986. I fully accept the need for a definition and I assure the hon. Member for Hammersmith that we have no intention of excluding such subsidiary bodies. However, I should like to consider the wording more closely. With that assurance, I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"but any reduction in the selling price of the land attributable to an agreement under section 52 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 specifying the provision of low-cost housing affordable by those in low paid employment shall be disregarded".</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment that is designed to ensure that where local authorities have reached planning agreements under Section 52 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1979 they specify that in the provision of housing affordable by the low-paid,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1190</span>
the difference in the market value of land or property with the planning agreement, as opposed to the higher value if the agreement did not exist, is not held to be financial assistance or gratuitous benefit under sections 25 and 26 of the Local Government Act 1988. The point is that if the difference in market value is interpreted as assistance or benefit, this would militate against the use of planning agreements which have been especially valuable in rural areas in ensuring that housing provision is made for the lower-paid.

I know that the Department is becoming increasingly concerned about the collapse in the availability of affordable rented housing in rural areas.

The planning agreement is a small way of improving upon it, although there has to be a wider approach because, in my judgment, the Government have seriously underestimated the extent and nature of the rural housing crisis. That is a wider argument. Our point here is to ensure that we do not restrict even further what can be done under the section 52 agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's claim that the amendment is a probing one. However, it is not apposite to clause 131 because the clause relates to the provision of services whereas the amendment relates to the provision of land at less than market price. On that ground alone, I would recommend that we reject it, but I understand that the hon. Gentleman may not wish to press it to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seems to make a wider point about the scope of the consequent requirement in section 25 of the Local Government Act 1988, which requires a local authority to obtain the consent of the Secretary of State if it wishes to provide financial assistance of gratuituous benefit to another person—typically, but not necessarily, a housing association—to enable the person to provide housing for letting. A gratuitous benefit includes providing land at less than its value on the open market. The hon. Member's amendment mentioned housing for low-cost home ownership. Section 25 of the 1988 Act has no relevance to housing for sale unless it is shared ownership and a general consent has effectively removed shared ownership from the consent requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities cannot be permitted to dispose of valuable assets on any terms they may choose, however well-intentioned the objective. Section 25 of the 1988 Act aims to reveal the full extent of the receipt which the authority proposes to forgo. In order to expose the true magnitude of the assistance, the benchmark must be what the land would realise if sold on the open market without restrictions other than those of a general planning nature. If the authority were able to depress the benchmark by imposing restrictive covenants in a section 52 agreement, the true picture of the subsidy would be hidden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should also be aware that acceptable limits of assistance have been set for different types of schemes in various parts of the country relative to the total cost of the scheme,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1191</span>
including land at unfettered market value. Those limits have been set with precisely the objective that the hon. Gentleman has in mind—the provision of housing at rents within the means of people in low-paid employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Housing Corporation's levels of grant for schemes involving private finance have been set in similar fashion. If a local authority was free to sell land at a price which had been depressed by a section 52 agreement, the purpose of the section 25 consent requirement would be vitiated and the result would be double subsidy. In those circumstances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the wording of the amendment does not fit easily into the Bill because it is a probing amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What troubles me about the Minister's response is that he has not dealt with the fact that if the difference in the market value is interpreted as assistance or benefit it will reduce the likelihood that a local authority will use section 52 agreements. I expected that the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson) would have been jumping up and down now because he has all the problems that could be affected by the principle being watered down in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Minister's anxiety about the hinding of a subsidy, but that can be tackled in other ways. Less easy to tackle is the fact that it will be at the least uncertain for a local authority to enter a section 52 agreement if it fears that the difference in the market value will be interpreted as assistance or benefit. It would almost be better not to enter into that agreement, but I do not believe that that is what the Government want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Clause 131(6) empowers the Secretary of State, with the consent of the Treasury, to give financial assistance to any person in respect of expenditure incurred in connection with the provision of services for owners or occupiers of houses in arranging or carrying out repair, maintenance or improvement work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned not with the principle but with the open-ended provision that will mean, in effect, that central Government provides financial assistance without the benefit of local knowledge. The amendment would rectify that by requiring the person who will receive financial assistance to be approved by the relevant local authority. Even this centralising, authoritarian Government cannot pretend that they know all the details. The local authority has far better local knowledge. It is not for me to protect the Government from its foolish errors, but the issue would be far better with the local authority than with the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would restrict the Secretary of State's ability to give financial assistance towards the cost of providing this type of service to those approved by the relevant authority. I understand the need to ensure that there is no proliferation of bodies seeking to provide such services in an area, although there is no harm in healthy competition in certain types of assistance. It makes good sense for those who want to provide a service to discuss their requirements and aspirations with the local authority, not least so that scarce public resources can be directed to the best effect. There is no need to provide local authorities with a veto. In any case, the Secretary of State may want to assist bodies operating on a broader base than in an individual local authority area, as he is doing now with Care and Repair Limited and the National Home Improvement Council. There is no virtue in that being circumscribed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall focus on the amendment, or we shall be out of order. The housing market has changed dramatically since 1978, which is why the Select Committee on the Environment decided that the scheme was no longer appropriate. In 1978 the average first-time buyer earned about £6,130 per annum, had a mortgage of about £11,030 on a house costing £13,650, which was about 22.6 per cent. of his gross average income. By 1988, the average first-time buyer earned £15,710, had a mortgage of £36,360 on a house costing £43,170, which was 28.5 per cent. of his gross average income. That is well above what many people can afford and why the fastest-growing cause of homelessness is mortgage repossessions. Before the Minister jumps to his feet and says that the mortgage companies report no problems with repossessions, the report out today prepared for the Department of Employment accurately points out that mortgage repossessions are the fastest-growing cause of homelessness. I have been saying that for some weeks, but the Government have denied it. The position in Greater London is even worse. There the mortgages of first-time buyers represent 33 per cent. of their gross average income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would change the system for the better and would introduce a scheme to assist first-time buyers. In October 1974 the Conservative election address promised that the party would reduce interest rates to 9.5 per cent. It said that they would
	<br><blockquote><p>"reduce the interest rate charged by building societies to home buyers to 9½ per cent. and ensure that it does not rise above that figure."</p></blockquote>
That was a failure if ever there was one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party made a similar statement in 1979. The hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Sir Hugh Rossi) put out a press release through Conservative Central Office—my hon. Friends will love this—which said
	<br><blockquote><p>"the next Conservative Government will manage the economy to keep interest rates down and so reduce the cost of a mortgage."</p></blockquote>
7.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1194</span>
On only two occasions in the past 10 years has the mortgage interest rate been below 10 per cent. All those promises were made back in 1974 and 1979 when the Conservatives were looking forward to that rosy future of Government and promising to keep the rate below 9.5 per cent. The Prime Minister had a rather different view of interest rates at that time and their effect on mortgages. Replying to my right hon. Friend the former Leader of the Opposition, now Lord Callaghan, who asked what the Government were going to do about mortgage rates, she said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As the right hon. Gentleman knows, interest rates are at this level because too many people want to borrow."</p></blockquote>
She continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I recognise that the Government are borrowing too much. An interesting correlation is that when the Government borrow less—as the previous Labour Government did under the instructions of the IMF and the borrowing requirement went down—interest rates go down. I shall be delighted to have the support of the right hon. Gentleman and those who sit behind him to get down Government spending and borrowing, because interest rates will then go down."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 22 November 1979; Vol. 974, c. 554.]</p></blockquote>
What a damning indictment not just of the policy on mortgages and interest rates, but of the whole policy of running the economy. What the Prime Minister was saying there was fundamentally and radically different from everything that she and the Chancellor of the Exchequer have said in recent times. It is one reason why people are being hit so hard by mortgages at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past few days the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer)—and in the Chamber on a previous occasion the Minister—have told me that subsidy of mortgage interest tax relief was not really subsidy of the same kind as housing benefit. They said that we should not look at it in that way and therefore should not worry about it going to people on higher incomes. It would be interesting to know what the Minister makes of the comments of the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine), a former Secretary of State for the Environment, when talking about people who bought houses in 1970. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Then, a first time purchaser, paid on average £4,300. In capital terms, his mortgage repayments are tied in 1970 values, but since then his income has trebled and the capital value of his home has quadrupled. It is difficult to see that a person in those circumstances can claim a need for subsidy at the expense of other taxpayers."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 26 November 1979, Vol 974, c. 909.]</p></blockquote>
It is interesting that present Ministers seem to take a radically different view from the right hon. Member for Henley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are offering the Government a way to recompense those people whom they fooled with all those false promises about how they would run the economy and how they would keep interest rates down to 9.5 per cent. or lower. With clause 132 they are missing an opportunity to wind up the existing scheme and introduce a new and better one which recognises that home owners are being pushed into crisis, particularly first-time buyers and couples where one partner has had to stop working and who are struggling to pay a mortgage. The average mortgage repayment for the whole of Britain has gone up by £81 per month and by about £112 per month in the south-east of England. It has increased
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1195</span>
by about £135 per month in Greater London in only one year. Those figures are for a year-on-year increase from January 1988 to January 1989. If the Government are asking people in the London area to pay £135 a month more, in just one year, than they were paying when they started their mortgage repayments, they have a duty to reconsider the scheme. I agree that they should scrap the existing scheme, as it needs to be radically changed. Here is the opportunity to do that. The Minister should recompense the actions of his predecessors, who made rash promises to people about home ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have just heard a leak. On the "Today" programme this morning, the hon. Member for Burnley revealed that there was soon to be a package on housing policy put together by the Labour party, which he rightly did not detail. It is now clear that part of that package will be a home loan scheme, as dreamt up by the hon. Member for Hammersmith and other Opposition Members. He has spoken of his great passion for the scheme, although we have never witnessed his support for it. I have never been asked about it, nor have I heard the scheme mentioned in any speech that the hon. Member for Hammersmith has delivered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason is now abundantly clear: he does not want to build on any measure that the Government have made. The Labour party will propose a brand new scheme that will have its own appeal. It will resemble the home loan scheme. However, it will be at variance with the views of Labour members of the Environment Select Committee, who were quick to damn that scheme. Nevertheless, my hon. Friends will acknowledge—as would Opposition Members if they were honest about it—that the substantial increase in home ownership in the past 10 years is principally as a result of the Government's policy on housing. Home ownership is now at a level never previously experienced in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hammersmith said that the Government were thinking about the rosy period of government which lay ahead. It has indeed been a rosy period of government. During the period to which he referred, which was some time ago, the Opposition probably never conceived that they would keep losing election after election. The new package which they will put before the electorate may be the answer to their prayers, as it will secure more votes for them. They will certainly need them. But the home loan scheme has had no friends. It was damned not only by the Environment Select Committee but by the Building Societies Association. We have reviewed it and concluded that it should be scrapped. During the past 10 years, fewer than 30,000 of those millions of first-time buyers have been home loan customers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hammersmith says that the amendments are designed to improve the scheme, which he believes would be more constructive than abolishing it. Although that is a superficially attractive argument, it does not hold water. Even at present levels of assistance, it would cost about £300 million this year if everyone who qualified for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1196</span>
assistance claimed it. That would not be a good use of taxpayers' money when the owner-occupied sector has grown so substantially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman sought to make what I can only describe as a Second Reading and, dare I say, second-rate speech. But it is a little hard to take Opposition Members referring to the failure of the government's economic policy when the main reason why they were so swiftly discharged from office was their economic failure. Hardly anyone has forgotten that inflation rose to a record level of 27 per cent. and was brought back into line only through the intervention of the International Monetary Fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to record that the Government had the option to introduce a new scheme, but they chose not to do so. We have offered them something that we thought might be attractive to them. It is no good the Minister saying that the Government have increased the number of people owning their own homes, when the primary way that they have done that is by reducing the number of homes available for rent. There are now 1 million fewer homes available for rent than there were in 1979. Half of them have gone from the public sector, the other half from the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have created a housing crisis for people who rent and also for people who buy. The amendment was an opportunity to help people who wanted to buy, but the Government have turned it down. That is yet another message that will go well beyond the confines of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor), whose name is also on amendments Nos. 836 and 837 has, unhappily, had to leave early to reach his rather far-flung constituency. The amendments, although technically separate, raise the same issue of principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 133 empowers the Secretary of State to require the disposal by new towns of their housing stock. I do not care much for that provision, as it smacks of the central direction of Government policy towards local government or devolved government,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V007P0I1077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1197</span>
which is perhaps the correct way of describing new town corporations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is totally unnecessary to empower the Secretary of State not only to direct the housing stock to be disposed, but to direct to which institution it should be disposed. Who is better qualified then the existing landlord and the former new town corporation to determine to which institution the housing stock should go? Subsection (2) carefully delimits the range of institutions to which the housing stock may be disposed—district councils, organisations or institutions approved by the Housing Corporation, and Housing for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an important principal involved. Should the Secretary of State have the power not only to direct the disposal of housing stock, but to direct it in a particular direction? The second power seems wholly unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 597 says that regulations shall provide that consultation with new town tenants on the transfer of the dwellings shall take place before 1 May 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I served on the new towns committee of the Association of District Councils for some years. The purpose of the amendment is to end the uncertainty of new town tenants over their future landlord by ensuring that ballots are held shortly after the legislation receives Royal Assent. Since 1986, the Department of the Environment has had a stop-go policy on holding ballots. There were unofficial campaigns in the Wrekin and Warrington and ballots were held. There was a ballot in Peterborough in 1987 when 93 per cent. of the tenants of the new town development corporation voted to stay with the local authority. Because the ballot was so successful for Peterborough council, the Government decided to block further ballots in the Wrekin, Warrington, Milton Keynes and Basildon until the financial terms of transfer had been finalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the view not only of the Labour members of the new towns committee of the Association of District Councils but that of the Conservative members with whom I had friendly discussions. They are worried that the Government will again transfer new town tenants to their local authority landlord. If tenants' choice is to be meaningful it must include the local authority itself. We must end the uncertainty and ensure that the ballots are held before 1990.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) puts his amendment to the vote, we might see a new phenomenon in this Committee—the Labour party might vote with the Government. I could not believe my eyes when I read the amendments and, when I heard the hon. and learned Gentleman speak, my worst fears were confirmed. No one likes to see a major—or semi-major—political party disgrace itself. The hon. Gentleman cannot have considered what he is proposing. He almost confirmed that his amendment would enable the present owner of the stock—I thin that he used the term "landlord"—to choose the new owners of either the whole or part of the stock from among the prescribed persons. As he is not indicating dissent, I assume that he stands by what he said. The Labour party and the Government know that the decision must and does lie with the tenants, not the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not believe my ears and the hon. Member for Hammersmith nearly had a cardiac arrest. I hope that it does not get out before the county council elections. It would be contrary to our intention that tenants should be given the opportunity to choose their future landlords. That is the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fairness to the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East, whose contributions have so far been very fair, I think that the hon.

This indeed is a probing amendment to seek clarification on the financial terms of disposal. In their consultation paper of August 1988 on new town housing transfer, the Government stated that the transfer would be based on tenanted market value.

This relatively technical amendment refers to the repeal of the Town Development Act 1952. The amendment would give the Secretary of State the flexibility to meet the anxiety expressed by at least one member of the Association of District Councils—Hastings. It wants the cut-off date to be one year later than is specified in the Bill for reasons of which the hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Warren) has been made aware. Basingstoke borough council has referred to that, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Trippier</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not foresee the necessity of extending the cut-off date for payments. The Department of the Environment has corresponded with the few authorities still receiving grants about making a capital payment as final settlement for the handful of remaining approved town development projects. Apart from three authorities, a financial settlement has been agreed and final payments made, or soon will be made. I assure the hon. Gentleman and all hon. Members that we want to reach a satisfactory financial settlement with the three remaining authorities. In those circumstances, there is no need for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
