Draft Merchant Shipping (Ro-Ro Passenger Ship Survivability) Regulations 1997</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport: (Mr. John Bowis)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Merchant Shipping (Ro-Ro Passenger Ship Survivability) Regulations 1997.</p></blockquote>
The regulations will revoke the Merchant Shipping (Ro-Ro Passenger Ship Survivability) (No. 2) Regulations 1994 and further enhance the safety of roll-on roll-off ferries serving United Kingdom ports by implementing the international agreement negotiated last year in Stockholm.<br><br>
Roll-on roll-off ferries provide essential services. They account for about 50 million passenger journeys each year. Businesses and the general public rely on them and rightly expect to travel safely. The Government have long recognised their responsibility in the international community to set the framework to enable that expectation to be met. We can be proud of our record in recent years in consistently seeking, and securing, the highest practicable safety standards for these vessels.<br><br>
It has been a developing process, the tragic catalyst for which was the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster in March 1987. We must never forget, particularly as we approach the 10th anniversary of Zeebrugge, the 193 lives that were lost. That memory has fuelled the Government's determination over the years to secure further improvements in ferry safety where necessary.<br><br>
The court of inquiry into the Herald disaster recommended many safety improvements. We acted quickly to introduce many measures, such as closed circuit television to monitor the car decks. We have also taken steps to improve enforcement of standards. All ferries serving our ports are subject not only to a thorough annual survey, but to at least two further inspections a year. We now inspect not just the ferries themselves, but the shore-based operation and the operating company's whole system of safety management.<br><br>
Many of the improvements have focused on operational aspects, but research carried out after the loss of the Herald demonstrated a potential risk in the design of ro-ro ferries. It showed that a conventional ro-ro ferry could capsize in relatively light seas after suffering collision or similar damage. There is a low statistical chance of such an accident, but the Government have remained adamant that the issue must be comprehensively addressed.<br><br>
Shipping in an international business and its safety depends on international agreement. In the early 1990s, we pressed hard in the International Maritime
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Organisation for agreement on a higher wider world wide survivability standard. Basic construction standards are set out in the safety of life at sea—SOLAS—convention, and survivability means the ability of a ship to remain afloat after it has sustained a degree of collision or similar damage.<br><br>
The SOLAS 90 standard was a significant improvement, but it applied only to new ships built after April 1990. Despite a vigorous campaign by the United Kingdom, other members of the IMO failed to agree that the SOLAS 90 standard should also be applied to older ships, for which a much lower standard—the SOLAS 92 standard—was agreed. We found that unacceptable. Therefore, we decided to take the virtually unprecendented step of brokering an agreement with neighbouring states outside the IMO framework. We did not take that step lightly. We took a strong lead and, in 1993, reached agreement with 13 other European maritime administrations to apply the SOLAS 90 standard to all ro-ro ferries operating internationally to ports in north-west Europe. That agreement was implemented in United Kingdom law by the 1994 regulations, which these regulations will supersede.<br><br>
Any complacency elsewhere in the world maritime community was shattered in September 1994 with the tragic loss of the Estonia. It is to the credit of the secretary general of the IMO that he immediately responded to the enormity of that disaster by establishing a panel of experts to review fully and quickly all aspects of ferry safety.<br><br>
In early 1995, research carried out in the United Kingdom and Denmark demonstrated that even in those ships where basic survivability was already high, additional measures, such as transverse bulkheads, could limit the destabilising effect of water entering the car deck, and so further enhance the chances of survival. The key issue is the robustness of the ship's design.<br><br>
The research significantly informed the panel of experts' recommendations that were considered at a specially convened SOLAS diplomatic conference in November 1995. The United Kingdom gave strong support to the whole package of measures proposed by the panel and particularly to a new survivability standard that required ships to meet not only the SOLAS 90 standard, but to resist capsizing with up to half a metre of water on the car deck. Given the circumstances, we were disappointed when the diplomatic conference failed to adopt the new survivability standard. It could agree only on world wide application of the SOLAS 90 standard, which the United Kingdom and other parties to the 1993 agreement had already adopted.<br><br>
However, the conference allowed Administrations to make regional agreements to apply a higher survivability standard. We took a leading role in negotiations, which resulted three months later in the Stockholm agreement. That agreement will apply a higher survivability standard to all ro-ro passenger ferries on international journeys in north-western Europe and the Baltic sea.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
Regulation 6 establishes a demanding time scale for action. Existing ferries that are further from the standard must be modified sooner than those that are closest to it. All new ferries must fulfil the standard. The majority of United Kingdom ferries are already close to the new standard. Regulation 4 reflects our decision to apply the Stockholm standard on United Kingdom domestic routes when conditions are comparable to international journeys.<br><br>
The Stockholm agreement constitutes a significant achievement. The United Kingdom was the first country to sign it on 1 July 1996, the first day on which it could be signed. We must implement it rigorously. We are grateful to the other nations that have cooperated with us to enable the application of higher standards to ferries that serve our ports.<br><br>
We acknowledge the co-operation of the ferry industry, which we consulted extensively. Compliance with the higher standard cannot be achieved without significant cost, and the industry should be commended for its recognition of the need for further action. We are also grateful for the constructive role that those who represent users of ferry services played. We are especially grateful for the support of the Herald Families Association.<br><br>
The regulations will further enhance the high level of safety that we have striven to achieve.</span></p>
<p>4.37 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party welcomes the regulations and agrees whole-heartedly with the Minister that they go a long way towards enhancing the safety of passengers and crews on ro-ro ferries. It is appropriate to recall the reasons for the regulations.<br><br>
It is a bitter fact that all major safety advances tend to be made only after appalling human tragedies. As the Minister said, the loss of the Herald of Free Enterprise almost ten years ago began a process that was accelerated by the loss of the Estonia.<br><br>
I pay tribute to the Government for attempting to ensure that the regulations were adopted internationally. The regulations state that the Government encourage their adoption by the International Maritime Organisation and the wider international maritime community. Can the Minister tell the Committee what form the encouragement will take?<br><br>
I welcome the speed with which the Government signed the Stockholm agreement. It shows that independent nation states can make beneficial agreements on a regional basis. I, too, pay tribute to the ferry industry, which operates in a fiercely competitive environment. It should be congratulated on its contribution to the discussions.<br><br>
The regulations contain matters that I hope the Minister can explain in more detail. I want to talk about regulation 6—I mean regulation 50 The lighting in the Committee Room is so appalling that I am having difficulty reading comparatively small print. Regulation 5(2)(b) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"in the case of a ship for which the value and calculation have not been submitted"—</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
to the Secretary of State—
<br><blockquote><p>"under sub-paragraph (a) above, such value and calculation shall be submitted by the owner to the Secretary of State for approval not later than 3 months before the ship engages on any regular scheduled voyage."</p></blockquote>
Does that mean that such a vessel would be allowed to operate if it was not operating within a regular, scheduled service? If so, why?<br><br>
My main cause for concern arises from regulation 10 on exemptions. Regulation 10(1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may exempt from any or all of the specific stability standards set out in the Agreement a ro-ro passenger ship which is not normally engaged on a regular scheduled voyage but which is required to undertake a single passage to or from a United Kingdom port."</p></blockquote>
I should like to know in some detail why that exemption is being allowed. I have already referred to the fierce arena in which ferry operators are working. Ships are being taken out of service and ferry companies are having to merge. What kind of vessel that was not in regular use could be used for a single voyage? If such a description was taken to mean a ship that had been out of service for some time—in dry dock, for example—what time scale would have to be adhered to, and what notice would have to be given to the Secretary of State, before it could be used for such a purpose? I understand that such a ship would have to meet the existing regulations on the safety of vessels at sea, but surely a ship that had not been utilised would have to be examined before it could again take to sea.<br><br>
I am still perplexed as to the reason for the exemptions. The sea and wind will not know that the ship is exempted. It will be as vulnerable to the vagaries of our weather, in certain channels thast suffer grievously from its extremes, as another ship would be. That aspect of the matter warrants examination.<br><br>
Regulation 9 concerns certificates. I should be interested to know whether the process that it sets out has already begun, or whether certificates will not be issued until after 1 April. How long does the Minister think that it will take for the relevant vessels in the United Kingdom fleet to be issued with such certificates?<br><br>
I should be grateful for detailed responses from the Minister on the points that I have raised, but the Labour party welcomes the regulations which are a step towards enhancing safety at sea.</span></p>
<p>4.44 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Member of Parliament for Dover, I express the same sympathy that other hon. Members have shown for those who died in the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster. Those people were not my constituents at the time, which was just before the 1987 general election, but I, like everyone in and around Dover, was very shocked. It was quite an experience to see such a thing happen. The families who lost people are now my constituents, and many of them still suffer problems. There will be a church service in Dover on the anniversary Sunday in a few weeks, which I propose to attend. The tragedy still causes considerable upset.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0075">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
Can the Minister confirm that the Department carries out safety checks each year on Dover's ferries? Often, those checks are unannounced. People from his agency turn up without warning to make sure that ferries operate safely. It is important, out of respect for those who lost their lives and to reassure future travellers from Dover, that checking and testing goes on.<br><br>
May I draw to the Minister's attention an evacuation exercise that I witnessed on a Stena ship in Dover. Some 800 people were evacuated and most of those who witnessed the exercise felt that it went rather well. It was not possible to construct a real-life situation at sea; but many would say thank goodness for that, as a life might have been lost. However, half the ship was tied to port and the 800 people were evacuated from the side of the vessel. A few life rafts failed, which was only to be expected, although one or two people felt that more failed than should have.<br><br>
Over all, the exercise was regarded as enormously successful. People came successfully down the ramps, and some disabled people were evacuated. There was much realism to the exercise, but no one was injured. Although it ran a little over the planned time, a live exercise would have been faster as people could have used ramps on both sides and would probably have met the timetable.<br><br>
I should be grateful to the Minister for some reassuring comments. In introducing new safety procedures, one does not want to give the impression that the ferries which sail from Dover and which constitute the town's most important industry, were anything other than safe under the earlier regulations. Of course, we also want to reassure people that the new regulations, and the work done by the Marine Safety Agency are enhancing ferry safety.</span></p>
<p>4.48 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate this country for leading the field in getting some sensible regulations. Will the Minister let us know whether any conclusions were reached during the various deliberations that have taken place on procedures and practices for crews of these vessels? Even on the most robust ship in the world—unless it is designed to avoid all human error or failure to carry out proper procedures—the training and qualifications of the crew will be of equal importance to the regulations, no matter how welcome they are. Can the Minister tell us something about that?</span></p>
<p>4.49 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Members for their commendation of the regulations and of the speed and the lead that the Government have shown on behalf of the whole House. We need safe standards, as reflected in the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw), who represents one of our great ferry ports. It is true that sometimes it takes a tragedy to galvanise the world but that charge cannot be laid
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
at our door in relation to applying pressure. We have pressed constantly over the years for other countries to join us in these measures. We have not got there yet.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson) asked how we achieve progress. We do that within both the International Maritime Organisation and the European Union to expand the area of application. Ferries coming into our ports are obviously our priority, but this is important in ports elsewhere in Europe and throughout the world. Eighteen nations have come along with us. France and Spain are doing so in terms of the spirit of the regulations and will comply with them although, because they have Mediterranean shores where ferries dock, they do not want two levels in law. They may not sign the document although they will come with us as regards ferries coming to our ports. That is good news. We must continue to set an example.<br><br>
Various issues have been raised. Regulation 5(2) applies standards to all ro-ro ferries using ports, and makes it clear that such ferries are not allowed to operate until there is confirmation that the required calculations have been made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister continues, may I make a point about regulation five? I was saying that ferries will not be allowed to operate on a regular schedule. Will they be allowed to operate outside a regular schedule and, if so, why?<br><br>
The regulation states that if they have not already submitted value and calculation they have three months in which to do so before being allowed to operate within a regular schedule of voyages. What will be the position if they are not operating within regular schedules?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unless they stay in port, they must meet our criteria. There will be no hiding place for them; they will be incorporated into the measures. There is a very limited exemption from the standard allowed under regulation 10 to enable the Secretary of State to agree to a ferry making a single voyage to or from a United Kingdom port. This allows a ship that would otherwise be required to meet the standard to move from one port to another for specific purposes, including repairs at a yard, or being sold. We are not talking of passenger-carrying journeys which the hon. Lady was concerned about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seek a little more clarification. I assume that that would be allowed only for non-passenger carrying vehicles, with no exemption for any ferry that carried passengers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would not be permitted on passenger-carrying schedules: a ferry going for repairs would not take passengers. Many ferries will automatically be issued with certificates if they apply the standards now. There will not be vast numbers of vessels. Other vessels are covered by regulation 6(2), which allows a phase-in period before implementation.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dover asked about inspections to ensure the safety of ferries. He was right to highlight that. It is not a question of design alone; enforcement is important. Perhaps I can here
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0076">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
encompass the point made by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie). The measure will go beyond that by ensuring that there is a thorough annual survey and at least two further inspections a year, one of which has been expanded further under the provisions of the directive on port state control. Unannounced operational checks are carried out by inspectors who travel incognito, making themselves known only to the master if they need to inspect a restricted area. Further checks on the operations of ferries will come into play when the European Community's early implementation of the international safety management code begins to bite on ferries. There is a very safe and rigorous regime to ensure that safety continues.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dover rightly paid tribute to the Stena exercise in which about 800 people on board a ferry were evacuated. He is right to say that it was not carried out on the waves of a high sea, nor was it done at a foolhardy pace, because it was necessary to avoid people being injured in what was a trial run. The exercise showed that vessels can be evacuated safely in peacetime, in a weather sense, and it will stand them in good stead in the war of a storm. I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend.<br><br>
There are many training measures not linked to this order which, as I said earlier, relate to the crews and management of ships and ferries. This proposal relates to survivability and design and how we can ensure that vessels entering and leaving United Kingdom ports,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
under whatever flag, meet standards which will benefit the good name of British and European ferry fleets and be in the best interests of passengers.</span></p>
<p>4.57 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply. Our nation has set the benchwork in maritime safety and in the training of our ships' crews and management. We welcome the regulations, which maintain our primacy in this respect while acknowledging that many other nation states are a long way behind us. The Minister referred to other states in the European Union which operate ferries which are not party to these regulations.<br><br>
There are ferries all over the world which, although they may not ply to or from United Kingdom ports, are likely to carry United Kingdom passengers. Obviously, those in the international maritime industry are anxious that the encouragement to which I referred earlier will take an energetic form in the United Kingdom. That will be of immense value not only to the United Kingdom and our European allies but throughout the world, and enhanced safety measures for these vessels can then become genuinely international.</span></p>
