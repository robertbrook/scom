Advanced Television Services Regulations 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness and Sutherland)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Advanced Television Services Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 3151).</p></blockquote>
There is a serious public interest at stake in part III of the statutory instrument before the Committee—or, rather, in its deficiencies. The order does not ensure that, in the digital age, the majority of television viewers in this country will have ready access to their preferred programmes on the BBC and ITV channels.<br><br>
As you will remember, Mr. Winterton, we debated conditional access when considering the Broadcasting Bill last year, and it is a complex matter. Previous technological advances in broadcasting have been put into effect by public service broadcasters. Broadcasting in the near future will move on to digital technology to convey the necessary signals to viewers. The technology has been expensive to develop and introduce, so privately owned companies have tended to take the lead in its development. This has put Members of Parliament in the situation of having to strike a balance between the interests of viewers and the rights of companies.<br><br>
The conditional access debate is the result of the shift to new technology, and the companies that have produced it have designed ways of ensuring that the people receiving their television programmes and the companies using the technology to transmit those programmes pay to do so. These systems, designed to ensure payment to the company controlling the technology, are called conditional access systems.<br><br>
When the Broadcasting Bill was before the House last year, I argued strongly for careful regulation of conditional access technology to protect the diversity and plurality of British television. When a company controlling the technology to operate a broadcasting system is also a broadcaster and programme maker, there is a clear risk of anti-competitive behaviour. The issue is not whether current operators of conditional access systems that are also programme makers—such as Sky—have abused their positions, but whether the potential exists for them to do so.<br><br>
The Broadcasting Bill, as originally drafted by the Government, contained no protection against abuse of conditional access systems. I am pleased that after pressure from me and many others, a measure of regulation of conditional access was incorporated into the Broadcasting Act 1996. However, I have never been satisfied that the Government properly understood the implications of their refusal to let the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Independent Television Commission, with its considerable experience of broadcasting regulation, to regulate conditional access. Instead, they have preferred that role to fall to the telecommunications regulator, Oftel, which is why the Minister for Science and Technology is in Committee to reply to this debate, rather than his colleague at the Department of National Heritage.<br><br>
I understand from that Government decision that they did not attach such importance to the maintenance of the established standards of British broadcasting. I hope, however, that the broadcasters did not receive the same message as I did, and that Oftel is successful in maintaining these standards. As I understand it, there is an institutional inclination in Oftel to intervene as little as possible. However, in this area it is not only proper but necessary for Oftel to intervene.<br><br>
I prayed against the regulations as they do not give sufficient protection to the access that viewers of public service television have to that form of television. Before I go any further on that technical point, I should point out that more than 75 per cent. of British households have not yet taken the decision to pay for satellite or cable television services, and receive their television from terrestrial channels.<br><br>
At present, viewers can select television programmes simply by looking them up in a listings guide and pressing the appropriate button on their television set or remote control. With the advent of digital, that will no longer be practical. There are likely to be at least 200 channels on satellite, 30 on terrestrial and more on cable. Television viewers will, therefore, be forced to rely on electronic programme guides to find the channel or programme that they want to see. Having done that, they will need to select it. Few viewers will want to remember the precise combination of numbered buttons necessary to select a channel, particularly as it will be only one of several combinations that they will need to know even to access all the available public service channels.<br><br>
It makes sense to circumvent the problem by making it easier for the viewer to select the BBC and ITV channels. Unless the regulators act now—the present regulations set out what they are required to consider—the electronic programme guide may not ensure easy access to the existing terrestrial channels. The reason for that is simple: the electronic programme guide will be designed and owned by the pay TV providers. Their commercial interests will lead them to promote and sell their television services through the operation of the guide. That will inevitably mean that the public service channels will be complex to access. As things stand, pay TV providers could design their electronic programme guides simply to display, for example, a choice between comedy, documentaries, news and drama, rather than displaying programmes channel by channel. If that was the case, the programmes that public service channels offered in those categories would be swamped by those on offer by the 200-plus satellite, cable and digital terrestrial pay television channels.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0305">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
It is, therefore, important that the regulators ensure that a direct, one-click route continues to exist from the remote control or television set to public service networks. Equally, they must ensure that an easily accessible public service network page exists on the electronic programme guide for viewers who have no wish to subscribe to pay TV. By public service network, I mean television channels that are available on payment of a licence fee.<br><br>
The House and another place have previously endorsed the principle that public service television has a specific remit to provide universal access. That was the basis for our decision last year to preserve the ability of terrestrial channels to show certain listed sporting events. As the representatives of the viewing public, it is our duty make it plain that we wish there to be easy access to public service television channels through the electronic programme guide.<br><br>
I have taken the opportunity in this short debate to press my point before the Minister. I hope that he will take it on himself to ensure that it is the view not only of the Committee and of Parliament but of the Government that the regulators should make such provisions.</span></p>
<p>4.38 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr. Ian Taylor)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to sit under your informed chairmanship, Mr. Winterton—you have a detailed knowledge of the issues before us, although you will, of course, be unable to contribute to today's discussion.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) has raised some serious points. They are part of a continuing debate for which I am delighted to be responsible. I take his point about the rivalry—in the widest sense—between the ITC and Oftel. The conditional access regulations before us are intrusive and economically complex. Oftel has become skilled in dealing with such regulations: as a result of the Telecommunications Act 1984 it has been responsible for the dramatic changes in telecommunications since then. Tough action will be needed to ensure that there is fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory access for all broadcasters through the conditional access system—the gateway, as the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) called it—and I believe that Oftel is the appropriate authority for that. Clearly, the ITC will retain other responsibilities, and they will be carried out properly, but these regulations will be enforced by Oftel.<br><br>
The regulations were laid and came into force on 7 January. Since the prayer against them, there have been some significant developments. The response to the regulations from some of the public service broadcasters has been very positive. For example, in a widely circulated letter to the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland, the Independent Television Association said:
<br><blockquote><p>"ITV is now broadly satisfied that the licensing regime put in place by the Advanced Television Service Regulations will create the requisite conditions for an open market and we hope that the House adopts the Statutory Instrument as soon as possible in order to provide the market with regulatory certainty."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
I endorse that, and hope that the Committee will too.<br><br>
I intend to keep my opening remarks brief, Mr. Winterton, and will try and catch your eye later. The purpose of the regulations is to ensure that there is fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory access through the gateway—the conditional access system—for all broadcasters. That will apply to all broadcasters, including those involved in digital terrestrial television. I am delighted that the bids were put in to the ITC on 31 January and that all the affected parties are at the table, thus undermining the Jeremiahs who said that that could not happen. I am delighted that my confidence that those parties would come to the table has been proved correct.<br><br>
I am also delighted with the statements from BSkyB about its digital satellite conditional access system, which that company has emphasised will be compatible with the digital terrestrial system. I am also pleased with the activities of the cable industry in terms of its own digital programme.<br><br>
The regulations in effect apply European directive 95/47/EC. Under that directive, which limited what we could do, mandatory licensing or mandatory decisions about technology and who could access it were not permissible. The regulations are designed to give fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory access, as I said. Effectively, they enable broadcasters to access viewers through every set-top box that can receive the signal.<br><br>
The regulations also include provisions under the Telecommunications Act requiring class licences covering the provision of conditional access services for speedy and effective oversight by Oftel. As I said, the director general of Oftel will take the powers very seriously indeed.<br><br>
The regulations are the result of a lengthy series of consultations, during which the Government kept an open mind. I believe that the regulations have the right balance, and I am delighted that the subsequent response from the various players, whichever medium they wish to choose for digital broadcasts, has been so positive.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland raised some detailed points, and I shall deal with them now. I have said already that Oftel is the right regulatory authority, but I understand the concerns of public service broadcasters. They have been used to people who have not taken out subscriptions to Sky or the cable industry having access to only four—soon to be five—television channels.<br><br>
However, many subscribers—especially to the cable industry—have mastered the ability of making sure that they can access the public service broadcasters, even though their control buttons do not make use of the usual numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. It will not be beyond human wit to access programmes that people want to watch. It is not my job, as Minister, to decide how electronic programme guides will develop. The technology will be complciated and innovative. There may be specialist providers of electronic programme guides. The crucial matter, which falls within the regulatory power of Oftel, is that if the electronic programme guide in some way behaved so that there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0306">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
was discrimination against the public service broadcasters, they would have a right of complaint—Oftel would be able to act.<br><br>
I am satisfied that the regulations in no way disadvantage the public service broadcasters—that matter will develop in accordance with the discussions, and Oftel and ITC are both, for different reasons, considering it—but in future we must be careful about what we mean by public service broadcasting. We now understand it to mean BBC 1, BBC 2, ITC, Channel 4 and—soon—Channel 5. Each of those companies might want to offer side, subscription or pay-per-view channels which might not of themselves be public service.<br><br>
We must consider all sorts of implications. The proper way to do that is for the ITC to examine the content of the EPGs and for Oftel to ensure that the EPG, as a conditional access system, does not discriminate against any broadcaster who wants to gain access to a viewer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is helpful of the Minister to say that the EPG system should not be discriminatory, but that is open to wide interpretation and might lead to inadequate protection of the interests which I described, bearing in mind that the public service broadcasters are investing vast sums in programme making. That is not comparable with the approach of the pay TV companies, which are putting out other sorts of programmes.<br><br>
Some viewers may have great difficulty in finding "Coronation Street"—or "Pride and Prejudice", to take a more appropriate example—against many other programmes of lower quality which involve less expenditure for the company that has put them on pay TV. That would be, in effect, discriminatory. It can be argued—it would be much easier if the Minister said whether he has accepted this point—that there should be quick access to the channels with which people are familiar.<br><br>
I know that interventions are supposed to be brief, but rather than intervening again, may I make a further point? I do not feel entirely reassured by the Minister's statement that many have mastered the ability to access programmes. That suggests a less than sympathetic awareness of the difficulties which people, particularly the old and those with poor eyesight, may encounter when going through the complex selection processes that modern television requires.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The definition of quick access emphasises how difficult it is for me to make a statement on the matter. I do not know what system will ultimately be used for access, which is why we have a regulator to ensure that, as the technology develops, there is no discrimination against any broadcaster, particularly a public service broadcaster. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland, although the matter is for Oftel to decide.<br><br>
I stress that there are clear rules. The EPG is within the regulations because we regard it as a conditional access factor. I simply do not know whether the EPG
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
will be accessed by a point and click, whether it will be like a personal computer and a mouse is moved around to use it, whether there will be specific programme guides to any particular multiplex, or whether there will be generic guides to comedy programmes, as the hon. Gentleman anticipated in his remarks. That is why I am not prepared to make a statement and try to pre-empt what the likelihood is.<br><br>
The BBC, which is a phenomenal provider of high-quality content programmes, is nevertheless a partner in one of the bidders for another of the multiplex stations, where it will be selling its programmes on a pay per view or subscription basis. The distinction between those is a little fudged, but that is not a matter for me. The role of the public service broadcaster, therefore, will be complex in an age of digital terrestrial television.<br><br>
In no way is it in the interests of anybody to make access to those programmes complicated. If anyone deliberately tried to do so by branding their logo across the EPG to confuse people or by using other methods, that would be a proper matter for Oftel. To reassure the hon. Gentleman and anyone who might take a close interest in this matter, the same implications could be seen to cover the applications programming interface, because to an extent that is also a conditional access system, partly due to the technology concerned with not allowing a virus to creep into the system and explode the set-top box, but also because the way to access interactive programmes through the set-top box will be a matter of considerable concern.<br><br>
I genuinely believe that the balance in the regulations will stimulate the activity which we all consider to be one of the most exciting ventures in recent British technological history and which will undoubtedly provide enormous benefits to viewers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Hoon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ashfield)</span></span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I call the hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon) to speak for the Labour party, I say to the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) that he will have an opportunity to come back at the end of this short debate if there are any matters that he feels unhappy about and wants to clarify with the Minister. He will easily be able to catch my eye.</span></p>
<p>4.51 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party has consistently supported the legislation underpinning the introduction of digital terrestrial television and will not, therefore, stand in the way of the regulations. We have consistently argued that it is important that the statutory framework should encourage the development of digital terrestrial television while at the same time creating the appropriate conditions for an open and fair market. It is important that digital conditional access operators use an approved digital standard and grant fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory access to all comers.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0307">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
The proposals clearly have complex technical, operational and security implications, emerging as they do against the background of the yet-to-beestablished industry of digital television. It is right, therefore, that we should be cautious in our approach to regulation because it is crucial that we allow the statutory framework that we established in the Broadcasting Act 1996 to encourage this new industry to grow. It is important to recognise that the current debate about the type and specification of set-top boxes is an interim debate and that ultimately we will buy television sets capable of receiving digital signals and receiving and unscrambling systems built into them. Nevertheless, in determining the rules for set-top boxes, we may well be determining the rules governing television for the foreseeable digital future. It is important that we get the regulations right.<br><br>
It is not without significance that the regulations anticipate those changes. Regulation 14 is concerned with decoders integrated into television sets; that rightly looks to the future of digital television technology.<br><br>
Before considering one or two specific issues that might arise, it is right that the Labour party should welcome the role of Oftel, as set out in the regulations. The regulatory framework on the digital gateway will be interpreted in detail and enforced by Oftel. That is to be welcomed, given its expertise in regulating related technological areas. In one sense, this is a recognition of the increasing integration of traditional distinct industries—those of telecommunications and broadcasting. Members of the Committee will be well aware that that was set out more than two years ago by the Labour party in our policy document, "Communicating Britain's Future". I welcome the Government's belated recognition of that increasing integration. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton. Having been provoked by the unseemly noises from the other side of the Committee, I say for the record that I hope that the Government continue to receive inspiration from Labour party policy documents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the next Parliament?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those policy documents will be available just as much in the next Parliament.<br><br>
The primary purpose of conditional access is likely to form the major part of our debate on the regulations. It is to provide security both for broadcasters and for viewers. Operators are understandably anxious to protect the integrity of their conditional access systems. They cannot afford to operate paid-for television systems, which can easily be bypassed by pirates. That affects viewers, because piracy is ultimately paid for by the honest subscribers either through increases in the cost of subscription or through lower-quality television broadcasts. Security is therefore a crucial issue and we cannot afford to overlook it in considering the regulations.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
There are genuine differences of opinion as to whether there should be single or multiple cards used for allowing subscribers to receive digital television services. The Independent Television Association made it clear in its submissions that it favours the use of multiple smart cards for a single set-top box. It is anxious that the conditional access supplier should not force a particular broadcaster to take linked services such as subscriber management. It believes that it is important for competition to separate the functions of conditional access from subscriber management.<br><br>
Broadcasters, the ITA believes, should have the option of issuing their own compatible smart cards to the set-top box, thereby authorising subscribers direct. Otherwise potential gatekeeper broadcasters would have access to the data base of another broadcaster's subscribers, putting them in a powerful competitive position, particularly regarding the scheduling of payper-view events.<br><br>
That is one view. It is a powerful argument, which needs serious consideration. Equally, however, it needs to be considered along with the concerns of BSkyB, for example, which is operating conditional access systems already. It is anxious for security reasons about multiple smart cards. Its argument is that they may be inefficient, that there may be operational difficulties and that they could compromise security. It argues that it is virtually impossible to create a completely pirate-proof system and that the use of individual smart cards is important in the battle against piracy.<br><br>
As I said, those arguments need to be addressed to determine which combination of programmes a subscriber has paid for—not least to ensure that subscribers who end their payments are no longer able to receive paid-for television services. It is an inevitably complicated argument given the multiple operations of particular broadcasters, and still more complex if a number of different broadcasters offer a number of different combinations—and therefore different smart cards—to subscribers. That obviously increases the potential for fraud and dishonesty.<br><br>
I have carefully read the various submissions on conditional access. It seems impossible to reconcile the conflicting views of the Independent Television Association and of BSkyB. It is not necessary for the purposes of our debate today to attempt to do so. Clearly, BSkyB talks of the risk to its business—and to the business of anyone offering conditional access systems—from multiple cards, which it believes would produce insecurity. It is equally clear that the Independent Television Association is strongly in favour of a multiple system of independent cards to be issued by particular broadcasters. I hope that the Minister can reconcile those two positions; I have thus far struggled in vain to do so.<br><br>
It is not right for the Committee to sort out those conflicting opinions. The regulations provide for a process whereby this matter can be resolved. It will be a matter for Oftel to decide. In the light of our debate, I hope that Oftel will carefully consider the issues and weigh the powerful arguments in favour of multiple systems in respect of competition as against the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
arguement about security. So far the security arguments have not been given sufficient consideration, not least because the use of insecure smart cards will undoubtedly become a still greater target for criminals, and we would not want to encourage that in any way. I am sure that Oftel will consider that matter carefully.<br><br>
Mention has already been made of electronic programme guides, from which similar issues arise. As a result of the 1996 Act, regulation will be by both Oftel and the ITC. Clearly, it is important—as has been said—that in a world of potentially hundreds of digital channels, the electronic programming guide, which will be the means by which viewers select the programmes that they want to watch, should be an open system. It must avoid the risk, about which some are anxious, of gatekeeper control by the EPG operator.<br><br>
It seems likely that there will be only a single EPG. It is a complex piece of technology and it is unlikely that boxes would be able to handle the amount of information that would be required for more than one electronic programming guide; therefore, how that guide is presented, the prominence given to particular channels and the branding used by the issuer of the EPG are all important. How different channels are presented and their order may well be important considerations for many people, as well as the position of the free-to-air channels and the public service broadcaster.<br><br>
Again, I do not believe that it is possible for the Committee to give definite answers to those questions today. The real questions arising from the regulations are whether we are giving Oftel the necessary powers to ensure that either conditional access systems or the electronic programming guide are sufficiently open, fair and non-discriminatory, and whether its powers are appropriate to deal with potential risks. It is important that viewers can find the television programmes they want with minimum difficulty and that the electronic programming guide should be fair and open. That would avoid any temptation on the part of broadcasters—who also operate such guides—to take too much advantage of their position to limit choice and competition. There is obviously a temptation for them to steer viewers towards their own programmes and services over those of their competitors. However, I have not received any representation to suggest that the regulations are insufficient to deal with the variety of potential problems. Several people have pointed out problems that could arise, but none have suggested that the regulations are insufficient to deal with them.<br><br>
There could be a problem with the interpretation of article 9, which is concerned with free-to-air services. Its wording was slightly amended, and it had been suggested to me that the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"consumer equipment capable of descrambling digital television signals"</p></blockquote>
could be interpreted to refer only to a conditional access system, whereas other elements in the decoder could have the capability of blocking free-to-air
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
signals. Such a box is already in operation in the Netherlands and could be used in the United Kingdom Market. I should be grateful if the Minister would make it clear that article 9 refers to the entirety of the box's operation and not simply to any one element within it.<br><br>
I have a similarly technical question about interactive services. The regulations will apply only to digital television and not, as I understand it, to interactive non-broadcast services such as video on demand and related Internet-style interactive services. Those are currently licenced under the value-added data services class licence, which I understand cannot be revoked until April 1999. There will therefore be a temporary difference in the regulatory regime, which could be significant in the digital era. However, the Government have indicated that they intend to bring those services into the same regulatory framework as soon as possible. I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm that.<br><br>
While I recognise the importance of the regulations in ensuring free and fair competition, we must also recognise the need to promote the use of digital technology in broadcasting. It has important benefits for broadcasters and viewers and, given the importance of developing a digital television industry, we should not be over-prescriptive in the use of regulations. Clearly, there is a risk that if we interpret regulations too harshly at the outset, we will frustrate those who wish to invest in this new industry and make it successful.<br><br>
Fortunately, that risk has been much reduced by the level of interest that has been demonstrated through the recently announced bids for the operation of multiplexes—that is an encouraging start and we hope that sensitive regulation will allow all those who want to participate in the exciting development of digital television to do so. When fully established, digital television can be vigorously regulated to produce effective and fair competition.</span></p>
<p>5.5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Several of the detailed points that are of concern to colleagues have been expressed. I am delighted that they have been given an airing. I am also pleased that Committee members have not said either that the regulations themselves are not effective or that they will not support them.<br><br>
I fully accept the comment made by the hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon) that the problem of whether there should be a single or multiple smart card will continue to be discussed. Properly, Oftel needs to examine the matter to find out whether any discriminatory factors are involved. The problem also depends on technological advances. It might be important for viewers to have more than one smart card in the box at the same time if they want to switch between different services or be notified at any moment of a different service.<br><br>
Those are matters which I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Ashfield are not the proper concern of the Committee. Suffice to say that, yes, I have examined and puzzled over how the technology might
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0309">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
develop. Ultimately, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the television set will be the main descrambling item and that there is no doubt that, given that a potential 42 million television sets will be replaced in time, there is a massive market. It is likely that any television set will need to be compatible with any means of delivery if it is to be priced at the right level. The market will develop and Oftel needs to be certain in the short term that there is no discriminatory activity.<br><br>
Security is an important matter in terms of intellectual property and of the ability to gain a return on progrmame investment. Moreover, the customer needs to be identified and to have a contractual relationship with the broadcaster. Again, we examined that closely during our deliberations to ensure that there was no obligation on a potential broadcaster by a provider of conditional access systems to take another organisation's subscriber management system on board in order to gain access to the viewer. We examined that issue and believe that the regulations are quite tight. Any broadcaster has the opportunity to get through to any viewer and to maintain sufficient know-how to enable that viewer to interact with the broadcast provider.<br><br>
However, in the final stage of the consultation, we closely examined the necessity of making any conditional access provider divulge sufficient information for a potential broadcaster to be able to gain access through the set-top box on the first day of broadcasting. That will ensure early access to enough of the technology to enable compatible services to be delivered.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ashfield mentioned article 9. I am happy to confirm that the article refers to the entirety of the set-top box, not just to the conditional access system.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is right to claim that fully interactive services are excluded at this stage from the regulations unless they are provided by broadcast signal, in which case they would be covered. That depends on how the technology develops, but we are examining that, along with the European Commission. Of course, if the viewer went straight to an Internet service provider—a file server—through the set-top box, complications would ensue and we would need to consider the implications. That is not a matter which need concern us at the moment. Indeed, we do not believe that to be the main problem. Because most of the signals will come through broadcast services, action is likely to be possible against any anticompetitive behaviour.<br><br>
Some of the regulations were tabled and came into effect on 23 August. They very much related to accessing sufficient technology so that manufacturers would be able to make set-top boxes compatible to receive satellite or terrestrial television if necessary.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
The regulations that came into force on 7 January, which embraced the earlier regulations, provide the right framework for conditional access and therefore for digital television.<br><br>
We are probably world leaders in providing a proper framework to stimulate digital terrestrial television. The success of the regulations was demonstrated by the way in which the multiplex licences were bid for on 31 December. That is, as I said, proof that we are discussing an exciting commercial opportunity. All the key players are at the table. In addition, positive noises are being made by BSkyB for its satellite development and by the cable industry for its services. Aspects of the regulations, incidentally, also touch on the cable industry's requirements.<br><br>
The package before us gives everyone the proper opportunity to provide services to any viewer on open, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.</span></p>
<p>5.11 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I need only detain the Committee briefly as the main points that I wanted to draw to the attention of the Minister, and through him to the attention of Oftel, were dealt with in the Minister's first speech.<br><br>
Article 11 imposes a duty on operators of conditional access services
<br><blockquote><p>"to offer to all broadcasters, on a fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis, technical services enabling the broadcasters' digitally-transmitted services to be received by viewers".</p></blockquote>
In setting the regulatory framework, and no doubt because it is being done by the Minister's Department, the prime concern has been to ensure fairness and nondiscrimination between producers, between companies and between broadcasters. I emphasise the importance of remembering the ultimate beneficiary of this exciting technology—the viewer—whose interests are not specifically spelt out in the article. I hope that Oftel will have them in mind when determining the fairness, reasonableness and non-discriminatory basis of the complex conditional access arrangements for television.<br><br>
I hope that the debate has served that purpose usefully. The Minister's earlier remarks encouraged me to feel that we are not far apart in our objective, but, like the hon. Member for Ashfield, I did not think it appropriate to try to come to a view on smart cards, to which he drew the Committee's attention. I look forward to resolution of that matter by those more competent than I.</span></p>
