THE QUALIFICATIONS AND NATIONAL CURRICULUM AUTHORITY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 233, in page 31, line 29, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>'or the practice of any profession',</p></blockquote>
and
<br><blockquote><p>(d) persons who appear to him to have experience of, and to have shown capacity in, the practice of any profession.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4A) Among the members of the Authority, not less than one third shall fulfil the requirements of subsection (4)(c).'.</p></blockquote>
As you have just assumed the Chair, Mr. O'Hara, I think that it is in order to wish you a good new year. I am sure that in your case it will be a very successful 1997. We shall look forward to the particular success that we might expect for you.<br><br>
The new authority is the result of Sir Ron Dearing's work. In his review of what was available for 16 to 19year-olds, he recommended the merger of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications and the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority. They will become the new authority, the Qualifications and National Curriculum Authority. When Sir Ron Dearing proposed the merger, he recommended explicitly that the consultation process should involve consideration of how employment interests might best be represented in future arrangements to ensure that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 580</span>
national vocational qualifications continue to be based on occupational standards and remain employment led.<br><br>
The Confederation of British Industry submitted to the consultation process several proposals that outlined its members' views on how their interests could be represented on the merged authority proposed by Sir Ron Dearing. The CBI proposed safeguards that it considered were necessary to ensure that what Sir Ron suggested did happen. It suggested, in particular, that members of the new authority should have appropriate experience.<br><br>
The amendment would slightly alter the make up of the authority. Will the Minister say why, when proposing the establishment of the Qualifications and National Curriculum Authority, the clause recommends that it consists
<br><blockquote><p>"of not less than 8 members nor more than 13 members"?</p></blockquote>
It will be smaller than the bodies that it replaces. Why are those figures different from those for the similar body that is proposed for Wales? Clause 43 states that the authority in Wales shall consist
<br><blockquote><p>"of not less than 10 nor more than 15 members".</p></blockquote>
The members of the new authority will be appointed by the Secretary of State, just as members of the present authorities are. Will the Minister confirm that, when appointments are made to the authority, they will be subject to the Nolan proposals regarding public appointments? I should have thought that Sir Leonard Peach, the Commissioner for Public Appointments, would be consulted about them.<br><br>
The amendment sets out how the membership might be altered slightly to ensure that not less than a third of the body has experience of
<br><blockquote><p>"industrial, commercial or financial matters"—</p></blockquote>
the category included in clause 37(4)(c).<br><br>
Under the amendment, those who have experience of
<br><blockquote><p>"the practice of any profession"</p></blockquote>
would be separated from those in the category under clause 37(4)(c). According to the present wording, it would be possible that no member of the body had experience relevant to those employing people in industry. Understandably, one would expect those with industrial experience to be concerned about such a gap; they are guaranteed no representation under the present wording of the clause. I am sure that the Minister will say that it is not the Government's intention to exclude those with industrial experience from the authority's membership.<br><br>
The clause contains other curiosities, with which the amendment does not deal. For example, an authority could be set up of which no member had experience of the maintained education system, as it is far from clear who can be included in the category under clause 37(4)(a). The amendment would alter subsection (4)(c), producing two categories: one under paragraph (c), the other under paragraph (d).<br><br>
The Minister must explain why the body is so small. Schedule 6, which deals with the functioning of the authority, mentions four other people who will be present at all its meetings, in addition to its members. It can be seen from how the authority will be set up that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0419">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 581</span>
those whom it employs will have a large say in what happens. In the circumstances, it is understandable that employers want adequate representation on the body that agrees the curriculum and qualifications, especially those relevant to employment.<br><br>
The Minister should give us some idea of the Government's thinking about who will be appointed to the body. I should like some assurance that those people will be appointed under what might be called Nolan principles, especially as the body will be small—it might have only eight members. Although four categories of people will be represented on the body, some people might fulfil the requirements of either paragraphs (a) and (b) or (c), or perhaps even (a), (b) and (c). Nevertheless, the body will be small and it might contain politically motivated people, so there must be a balance, such as that found in the Nolan proposals. One or two political appointments would be influential in such a small body.<br><br>
I should also like to be given some understanding of the mode of appointment to the authority and of how the Bill would guarantee Sir Ron Dearing's initial reflections on the body's ability to respond to employers. I think that the amendment is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mrs. Cheryl Gillan)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) was brief in moving the amendment and I shall also attempt to be brief. I hope that I shall satisfy him on some of the points he raised.<br><br>
The amendment is aimed particularly at ensuring that employment interests are firmly entrenched in the board of the new QNCA. That is the Government's intention and it is why the clause requires the Secretary of State to appoint to the board alongside educationists, members with experience of training and members from the world of employment. As a matter of common sense, the Secretary of State will ensure that employers have a strong voice and that there is an even balance on the board between industry and education. If the QNCA cannot command equal respect from all, it will not be able to carry out its functions effectively. However, the amendment puts further constraints on appointments by requiring separate representation for the professions and that a third of members be from industry, commerce of finance.<br><br>
The QNCA will have a wide remit and will be a key player in improving the nation's level of attainment in training and education and in lifting our skills base. So its board of eight to 13 members must be compact, effective, and able to rise above any narrow sectoral interests. Members will have access to advice and expertise from officials, observers to the board and committee members and will bring a wide range of relevant experience and expertise with them. However, as QNCA members they will be responsible for considering the needs of the community as a whole, rather than those of any particular interest group. I do not therefore believe that there is a case for extending representation beyond the broad sectors of education,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 582</span>
training and employment. Setting out specific proportions of representatives could mean appointments being made on the basis of a numbers game, rather than strictly on merit.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised some other points. First, he mentioned the numbers on the Awdurdod Cymwysterau, Cwricwlwm ac Asesu Cymru, or ACCAC. It is not a new body, but the reconstruction of an existing body. It would not therefore be appropriate to change the size of the board, as I am sure all Opposition Members will understand. Secondly, the appointment of members of the new QNCA will be carried out in accordance with normal procedures; the chairmanship has already been advertised under the Nolan provisions and the membership will be similarly advertised. I hope that those assurances have convinced the hon. Gentleman that the amendment is unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for her reply. She did not answer a couple of small points. I would still like to know why more people are required for Wales than for England. I am sure that some members of the Committee feel that what happens in Wales is extremely important, but there are more people to be represented in England and I am puzzled at the proportion of representation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend heard the Minister say that the chairmanship had been advertised. Is he, like me, concerned about the timing of that immediately prior to a general election, given that the chairman will play a crucial role in the future of education? Does he agree that it is of extreme concern to Opposition Members that such an appointment should be made at this time?</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is of great concern. The Minister did not give the exact timing but I would assume that the appointment to the chairmanship would not be settled until the result of the general election is known. It would be absurd to appoint someone before that, even following the Nolan principles, as the chairman will have to work closely with Ministers and the Secretary of State. While there is uncertainty about who will be the Secretary of State, it would be unwise to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like swiftly to mention the composition of the two bodies in England and Wales. Will my hon. Friend reflect on the fact that in Wales there are between 10 and 15 members because the Welsh are well known for their brevity and can afford to have a larger committee, whereas in England the Government dare have only eight to 13 members because of the loquacity of the English?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister can comment on that and help my hon. Friend, although it may be that we should look for other explanations.<br><br>
My main concern is that all parties concerned about the decisions made by the authority should be represented. I accept the Minister's assurance that people with concerns about employment qualifications will be represented. I hope that people
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0420">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 583</span>
representing the maintained sector in education will also be included. I am concerned that the representation of others is not guaranteed in the wording of the clause but I accept the Minister's assurances and, in those circumstances, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
FUNCTIONS OF THE AUTHORITY IN RELATION TO EXTERNAL VOCATIONAL AND ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 226, in page 33, line 49, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(8) The Authority shall establish a Board, to be known as the "National Vocational Qualifications Board" which shall have the functions falling within paragraphs (a) to (i) of subsection (2) above where these relate specifically to National Vocational Qualifications.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(9) The National Vocational Qualifications Board shall include a majority of members who have experience of, and have shown capacity in, industrial, commercial or financial matters.'.</p></blockquote>
I think that we can deal with this amendment equally briefly. It would require the setting up of a national vocational qualifications board. Given the merging of the two systems into the joint authority, it is important, especially to employers, that there is a body with specific responsibility for NVQs. It is possible to set up such a body under the arrangements set out in schedule 6, to which we have just agreed. It is proposed that the authority will set up a number of committees to deal with different aspects of its work, but it would be helpful if the Bill specified the establishment of an NVQ board. NVQs are unique in that they are the only qualifications whose standards are based on competencies developed by employers.<br><br>
The CBI argued in its submission for a discrete board to be established under the authority; the amendment would put that into practice. That would ensure that the interests of employers were given full consideration by the authority in carrying out its functions.<br><br>
It is important to give national vocational qualifications the same dignity that is given to academic qualifications. That has not yet happened, perhaps because the Secretary of State has not been sufficiently concerned to establish their validity. There is still an assumption in the British education system that academic qualifications are worth while, while vocational qualifications are of lesser concern and lesser status. It is important to the development of our educational system that we give vocational qualifications equal status. That is why we should make specific provision for the setting up of an NVQ board to which employers can refer and which will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 584</span>
take account of their particular concerns about the standards, relevance and modernity of such qualifications.<br><br>
This is an important matter, and I hope that in his reply the Minister will tell us what he expects the authority to do to enhance the status and credibility of vocational qualifications. We need a marketing process, because those qualifications need to gain status to improve their take-up by schools and to increase the importance that schools attach to the courses that lead to them. That is a matter with which a board dealing specifically with those qualifications might help.<br><br>
I accept that the Bill includes provision to enable a committee to be set up that would be specifically concerned with national vocational qualifications, and I would be interested to learn of any steps that the Minister thinks could be taken to improve their status, to encourage their take-up by students and to ensure that they are kept relevant to employers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has taken us into the familiar territory of parity of esteem, which is an old friend, and an old enemy, I suppose, in some ways, and something that has bedevilled education and training for a long time—as I know that the hon. Gentleman well understands. It is fair to say that part of the motivation for bringing together the former Department for Education and The Department of Employment was to try to tackle the divide, the prejudice and discrimination that have existed in our educational and training worlds for all too long.<br><br>
Interestingly, Sir Ron Dearing, in one of the many excellent jobs that he has done on our behalf over recent years, identified as one of the major contributions that we could make towards exactly what the hon. Gentleman has asked the creation of a body such as the QNCA, which would bring together in one place responsibility for academic and vocational qualifications and in doing so, deal with the parity of esteem problem. By doing that, there would be equality of treatment.<br><br>
Part of the answer to the important question asked by the hon. Gentleman is the establishment of GNVQ part 1 in schools for the 14-year-old age group and the rapid and very welcome development of GNVQs generally. That will provide an alternative route to the strictly academic one to which all pupils have been condemned for as long as anyone can remember and will give them a legitimate and valid alternative, which will carry the weight and conviction that we intend. It will widen the possibilities for youngsters who have been turned off or unattracted by the narrow academic options that have been available until now.<br><br>
The problem with the hon. Gentleman's amendment is that there is a risk—I put it no higher—that setting up a separate board for vocational qualifications would perpetuate the differences and distinctions and undermine our efforts to introduce parity of esteem. That would be far from the effect suggested by the hon. Gentleman. I accept that it is a matter of judgment. The hon. Gentleman has argued that if the vocational aspect were separate and were given its own board within the aegis of the QNCA, that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0421">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 585</span>
would give it some sort of special dignity. I argue the opposite and say that it would perpetuate the sense of difference and distinction. There is a danger that the traditional, more academic qualifications, including GNVQs funnily enough, would be dealt with by the mainstream QNCA and that the vocational ones would be dealt with by some offshoot of a board.<br><br>
That is the danger, but there is no reason why the Committee should believe only me—I recognise that an occasional member of the Committee might not believe me now and again. Sir Ron Dearing identified the problem with great clarity. He argued cogently for a unified approach, and our response is the QNCA as set out in the Bill. Although I recognise the problem identified by the hon. Gentleman, I do not share his analysis and ask him to think carefully about the matter. Perhaps he should allow us to carry forward the QNCA as set out in Bill—not in the form suggested in the amendment—because we share the same objective. My judgment is that that is more likely to be achieved by a unified approach rather than a divided one. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Minister and I are both looking for parity of esteem. I refer him to paragraph 13 of schedule 6 which refers to committees. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Authority…may establish a committee for any purpose; and…if so directed by the Secretary of State, shall establish a committee for such purpose as is specified in the direction."</p></blockquote>
There will be a great deal of work for the authority and its task will be great, but I believe that some aspects of GNVQs will be considered by a committee that is specifically set up to do that. I accept that it is important to merge the bodies overall because that would be a way of dealing with parity of esteem. How will the tasks be carried out in practice?<br><br>
Paragraph 13(3) of schedule 6 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State may determine, a committee may include persons who are not members of the Authority."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, it is probable that the thrust of my amendment will be carried out by such a committee because the conditions mean that one would not be able to bring in others with experience of employment who were not members of the authority. As I said, for the task that it has to carry out, one could bring them in and create a committee precisely along the lines suggested in the amendment.</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a better case against the amendment than I was able to. He is right; schedule 6 does give such flexibility and it would enable the QNCA to consider the best approach to a problem that we have both identified. The powers in schedule 6 mentioned by the hon. Gentleman render the amendment otiose. I suspect that if he listens to himself and draws his own conclusions on what he has said, he will probably agree with me that the amendment is unnecessary.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 586</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said before the debate that the matter needed to be raised. We want it on record that Ministers have listened to what is said about their propositions by industry. It is therefore important that the Committee should discuss the question. I can see that it is important to establish parity of esteem in practical terms; and it is important that Sir Ron Dearing's views on how the body responds to employers should be made to work in practice. People may not have studied the schedule; unless the Committee had debated the matter, they would not know that employers can respond as they wish. Given that, and given that the Minister has responded positively on those questions, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak only briefly. I wish to put down a marker about the Welsh aspect of subsection (3), which refers to the powers of Awdurdod Cymwysterau, Cwricwlwm ac Asesu Cymru, or ACCAC—when saying the acronym, all the Cs need to be pronounced separately. Linking the provisions of clauses 40 and 46 clause 46 (1) is referred to in clause 40(3)—gives scope for the DFEE and the Welsh Office to come to different arrangements over time. Those arrangements are quite different from those for Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I am putting down a marker that on Report I shall return to the question, hoping that someone from the Welsh Office may have the opportunity to speak on the matter.</span></p>

SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS RELATING TO DISCHARGE BY AUTHORITY OF THEIR FUNCTIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 228, in page 34, line 24, after 'competence)', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'such requirements being determined following consultations with such bodies as may be considered appropriate.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 230, in clause 48, page 37, line 30, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'such requirements being determined following consultations with such bodies as may be considered appropriate.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be exceedingly brief. The amendments relate to a particular function of the QNCA and the QCAA for Wales. The Minister will, no doubt, argue that the amendments are otiose in that we propose that the QNCA, for example, will, in carring out its functions,
<br><blockquote><p>"have regard to…the requirements of industry, commerce, finance and the professions regarding education and training (including required standards of practical competence)."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0422">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 587</span>
However, it would be helpful to have in the <i>Official Report</i> a comment from the Minister on the nature of the consultation that she envisages being undertaken to ensure that the QNCA and QCAA truly ascertain the requirements of the various bodies referred to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mrs. Cheryl Gillan)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) has said that I shall argue that his amendments are otiose. He is correct.<br><br>
The amendments would require the QNCA and ACCAC to consult appropriate bodies in industry, commerce, finance and the professions to establish their requirements regarding education and training. Those provisions are unnecessary as clauses 42 and 48 already require the QNCA and ACCAC to have regard to requirements in those areas. The authorities will have to take information from those fields in order to do so. There is no need for a formal and bureaucratic tier of consultation such as the one proposed by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The Government intend that the QNCA and ACCAC will provide a strong platform for the development of knowledge and skill that will equip learners to make their way in an increasingly competitive world. We share the hon. Gentleman's view that both authorities should take account of the needs of the world of employment. That is why clause 42(1)(c)(ii) and clause 48(1)(c)(ii) have been included.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman himself knows his amendments to be otiose, and given my assurances, I ask him to withdraw them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given no assurances whatsoever; she merely read what it says in the Bill. I asked her to indicate the nature of the consultation; she has given us the opposite of reassurance. She has put it on the record that she does not believe that any formal tier of consultation should be created.<br><br>
I am worried that the Minister has said that consultation is important while telling us that it is not to be formal in this vitally important area. I hope that we shall have an opportunity to raise this point again later and that there will be a rather more helpful reply than we have had from the Minister. A more helpful response, on the record, will be important for the new authorities before they begin their work. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 238, in page 34, line 36, after 'question', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State'.</p></blockquote>
It is important to put on the record the fact that the Opposition warmly embrace and support the general premise of establishing the QNCA to promote quality and coherence in education and training. However, we have specific concerns about subsection (4)(a), which gives an unusual power to a non-departmental public body over the level of fees. That is certainly unusual in relation to independent charitable bodies, some of which are limited by royal charter and some of which are parts of universities.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 588</span>
We have been advised that all other price control powers given to, for example, the regulators of public utilities are linked closely to specified criteria, such as the control of monopoly profits. But no such criteria apply in this case.<br><br>
The proposals have the potential for enormous administrative complications. There are more than 1,000 qualifications, each catering for different markets and necessitating cross-subsidisation from popular qualifications so as to secure essential specialists for minority qualifications. There is immense scope for bureaucracy, cost and possible litigation. The only justification advanced so far by the Department for Education and Employment is that it considers that where institutions enter candidates for qualification, using pubic funds, the exposure of the public purse should be controlled and limited. That is acceptable as far as it goes. We sympathise with that view but we think that the objective would best be achieved through conditions built into the public funding regimes of all involved—the schools, colleges and TEC funding training providers.<br><br>
The present proposal fails to acknowledge that more than 50 per cent. of candidates for qualifications awarded by the Joint Council of National Vocational Awarding Bodies are adults paying their own fees without support from public funds. Hence our amendment. We believe that powers to limit funds should be retained by the Secretary of State, not passed down to the QNCA. We do not think that the latter should be able to determine the amount of exposure of the public purse. This is clearly the responsibility of the Secretary of State, perhaps exercisable through regulations relating to categories of qualifications. We earnestly hope that the Government will see the good sense of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillian</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle). He was right in saying that a substantial amount of public money is spent on examination fees. It is entirely right to have safeguards to ensure value for money. The Bill's power to cap fees is given to the QNCA as a condition that it may impose in accrediting qualifications. I have received representations from teachers and awarding bodies. I agree that it might be appropriate for the Secretary of State to be involved in the exercise of this power and for the QNCA not to be the sole arbiter between the legitimate concerns of centres and awarding bodies.<br><br>
However, I am not in favour of effecting that involvement through the bureaucracy of regulations. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State favours reducing and rationalising the number of bodies awarding national qualifications, in the interests of ensuring consistent and high standards. She does not favour eliminating choice and innovation through a nationalised monopoly of provision. Choice and competition help to deliver qualifications that are responsive to learners' needs at reasonable cost. Making the power subject to legislation would impose a layer of bureaucracy and suspicion on what is essentially a reserve power. Nevertheless, having heard

the hon. Gentleman's remarks and outside representations, I am willing to consider the issue further and return to it on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Lady's constructive comments, notwithstanding her aside that Opposition Members do not favour choice and diversity in qualifications, along with everyone else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that even if a single body were responsible for qualifications, it would be quite possible for it to offer a range of syllabuses to institutions interested in choice?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that one body can have many forms and that it would be appropriate to consider that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

LEVY ON BODIES AWARDING QUALIFICATIONS ACCREDITED BY RELEVANT AUTHORITY</div> <!-- title -->
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 239, in page 39, line 38, leave out 'vocational'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 240, in page 40, line 7, leave out 'vocational'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are simple and brief amendments which go to the heart of what we mean by saying that we want parity of esteem between the vocational and the academic. Although the historical
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 590</span>
basis of the levy on vocational awarding bodies is recognised, the ability of the QNCA to make such a levy only on vocational qualifications in the future seems inconsistent with the Government's declared intention to establish equal esteem between academic and vocational awards.<br><br>
The amendments would enable the QNCA in the future to impose a levy on any qualification accredited by, or approved through, the authority. It is high time we began to put our money, or other people's money, where our mouths are, if you will pardon the expression, Mr. O'Hara, and to do something concrete to raise the question of parity of esteem between the vocational and the academic to more than the expression of higher sentiments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: NCVQ currently raises a levy on all NVQs awarded, but at present this goes towards financing its main business of accrediting and quality assuring qualifications. This is a direct contribution by employers to the upkeep of a system from which they and their employees directly benefit. Consequently, there is no parallel provision for academic qualifications.<br><br>
The clause provides for the continuing collection of a levy on vocational qualifications but changes the way in which the money will be used. It allows the Secretary of State to make regulations to require bodies awarding vocational qualifications accredited by the QNCA or ACCAC to pay a levy to the relevant authority.<br><br>
The proposed amendments would enable the QNCA to raise a levy on any type of qualification. This means that the levy could be extended to include GCSEs, A-levels and so on, which was presumably the amendments' intention.<br><br>
Our intention is that the QNCA will disburse the money collected through the levy to industry bodies to fund the improvement and maintenance of the standards of occupational competence which underpin vocational qualifications, through contracts. Details about the rate of the levy, and when and how payments are to be made will be set out in regulations. That would link employers more closely to the standards developed for their sectors. It would give the national training organisations, and others responsible for developing standards, a more direct interest in the number of NVQs awarded. For example, they are well placed to market NVQs within their sectors, but at present, they have no financial incentive to do so. The provision should contribute to making NVQs more relevant and popular.<br><br>
Vocational qualifications are designed to benefit employers and employees directly and to be, as it were, owned by them. Raising the levels of employee skills and competences are of benefit to all, so it is appropriate that employers should contribute to and have a stake in vocational qualifications development.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I realise that he has passed on a little from the point that I now wish to make, but he said that the whys and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0424">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 591</span>
wherefores of how the distribution would take place would be set out at a future date. How does he view the distribution of those moneys within industry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prejudge that issue because we are setting up a new all-embracing body. National training organisations are relatively new and we all share a desire to promote the standards, relevance and recognition of vocational qualifications, whether they be GNVQs in schools, for example, or NVQs in the workplace. I do not want to pre-empt the important work that will have to be done to determine how best to use the moneys raised through the levies to achieve those results.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am again grateful to the Minister. Does he envisage that such matters will be for the Secretary of State to determine or will they be determined by the QNCA?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Such matters are for the QNCA. Whenever Parliament, through the legislative process when discussing a Bill such as this, decides to give the responsibility for such matters to a body such as the QNCA, we must trust that body to make important decisions. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman may be as torn as I often am about how far one then seeks to retain to the Secretary of State of the day powers, which are either general or specific, to provide a safety net. For example, if the body to which the responsibility has been given does not do what it was intended to do, the Secretary of State can step in and say, "Hold on a minute. I think that that should happen in a different way."<br><br>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will recognise the paradox. On the one hand, we want to depoliticise the matter by giving power to the body to which the responsibility is allocated under the Bill. On the other hand, we always want to retain an amount of responsibility for the Secretary of State of the day. Given that, our view is that the QNCA, properly set up and involving as it should do people with knowledge of different sectors and areas, deliberating as it will and setting up committees as it may decide to do, will come to a view on such important matters.<br><br>
However, in the end the Secretary of State must necessarily have some residual role to ensure that the body is doing broadly what we consider to be right and what the Government of the day approve of. Such tension always exists throughout the Government when we devolve decisions and Executive action from Departments and Ministers to agencies or bodies. The same applies under the Bill.<br><br>
Fortunately, we know about the track record of the SCAA and the NCVQ. In bringing them together and giving them enhanced powers and an enhanced role, we are saying that there is a continuum in the sense of raising money from employers and redeploying it to maximise the effectiveness of vocational qualifications. The difference between us and the Opposition is that we do not want to take that crucial step further and say that we want to spread the levy-raising powers to the traditional academic sector. Given what has happened in the past and what we envisage for the role of the QNCA, our view is that it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 592</span>
is appropriate to maintain the existing limitation in the sense in which we understand it. I see no justification for including in the Bill the broadening proposed by the amendment; it is not necessary and, indeed, I see some dangers in it. I argue that the amendment should not be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that many people will have the perception, which the Bill may exacerbate, that there is a wide distinction between the platitudes about parity of esteem that often come from the House—from both sides, perhaps—and the reality on the ground.<br><br>
As to the proposed powers, there is an analogy here with what I said about amendment No. 238. The Minister acknowledged that tremendous powers will be given to the new body; he will make the case for that. Labour Members would like to be as helpful to and understanding of that case as possible.<br><br>
The matter underlines the importance of the way in which, prior to the election, the Government approach making appointments to the body. Whoever is in power after the election, the personnel who will be empowered under the Bill will be crucial to the positive and constructive approaches that we hope will emanate from the new body and to the direction that it will take. I hope that the Government will ensure that the appointments are not made with undue haste; that is a matter of great concern to us. However, given the Minister's comments, and in eager expectation of future provisions governing these issues, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

FUNCTIONS IN RELATION TO COMPLAINTS BY AWARDING BODIES</div> <!-- title -->
<br><blockquote><p>'The Qualifications and National Curriculum Authority shall carry out an investigation and, if it considers it appropriate, make a report to the Secretary of State where a body which authenticates or awards an external qualification—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(a) withdraws its consent or approval for a person to provide education or training leading to the award of that qualification; and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(b) notifies the Qualifications and National Curriculum Authority that it has taken such action and the reasons for doing so.'.—[<i>Mr. Kilfoyle.</i>]</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
The new clause has a relatively simple purpose. It would provide the new Qualifications and National Curriculum Authority with the power to investigate the awarding of a qualification by institutions or individuals and to prevent those individuals or institutions from shopping around for an alternative body.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0425">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 593</span>
Before an institution can offer any vocational qualification, it must first meet certain overall quality criteria; I understand that that is known in the trade as "centre approval". As much of the assessment of the vocational qualifications is conducted at the centre, the institution will have to commit itself to a number of other quality control procedures for each field, so as to assure the awarding body that only qualified candidates are certificated; that, I understand, is known as "qualification approval".<br><br>
Awarding bodies regularly monitor how institutions conduct their courses. In cases where an institution fails to satisfy the awarding body that it is undertaking the quality procedures laid down, the awarding body may withdraw either the qualification approval or, in extreme cases, the centre approval. That removes from the institution the ability to offer either a specific qualification or any qualification of the awarding body.<br><br>
At present, if either of the two approvals is withdrawn, there is nothing to stop the institution shopping around and moving to another awarding body. That is possible even when approval is withdrawn because of fraudulent activity by the institution.<br><br>
We do not believe that the Bill will provide the QNCA with the necessary powers to investigate cases of misconduct by an institution, nor to prohibit that institution moving to an alternative awarding body, even when misconduct is proved. The new clause would effectively resolve that anomaly.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The new clause would expand the QNCA's remit inappropriately and unnecessarily. The QNCA already has broad powers to accredit qualifications and, by extension, to impose requirements on the bodies awarding those qualifications.<br><br>
Clause 42 allows the QNCA to require entry to premises where its accredited qualifications are awarded. That builds on the excellent work that the NCVQ has carried out in uncovering instances of bad practice and—in some cases—fraud and abuse in the awarding of NVQs. The QNCA will scrutinise the quality and robustness of the practices and procedures carried out by awarding bodies, rather than the institutions themselves. If the QNCA is satisfied with the work done by awarding bodies in approving centres to offer their qualifications, I see no reason why—as is proposed in the new clause—it should duplicate their work. If the QNCA is dissatisfied with an awarding body's procedures, it can take measures up to and including withdrawal of accreditation from its qualifications.<br><br>
More generally, it is not the job of the QNCA to investigate standards of teaching and learning in individual institutions. When that falls outside the work of awarding bodies in approving centres, that is surely a matter for the Office for Standards in Education, the Further Education Funding Council's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 594</span>
inspectorate and the new inspectorate that we are setting up to consider training and enterprise council funded provision. The QNCA will, of course, have close links with all of those bodies.<br><br>
Withdrawal of approval from a centre to offer qualifications may indicate a range of things: something may be wrong with the standards of teaching and learning at that institution, there may have been an administrative failure to pay fees on time, or the centre may simply no longer wish to provide the qualifications in question. Different actions will be appropriate in different circumstances, rather than a statutory requirement on the QNCA to investigate.<br><br>
Many awarding bodies currently notify the NCVQ when they have withdrawn centre approval. It would be possible for the QNCA to require that as a condition of accreditation. If a spate of withdrawals of approval indicated that an awarding body had not being properly applying centre approval criteria to start with, the QNCA may well investigate the matter. If a wider problem were indicated with an institution, the matter could be referred to the appropriate inspectorate—as I have already said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must take the Minister up on that very point. Will he explain for the benefit of naive, ignorant Opposition Members exactly what process he would expect in the case, say, of an institution at which there had been fraudulent activity? Would he expect the QNCA to refer that matter to the new inspecting body? What is his prognosis for a situation in which there is fraudulent activity?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a very fair question, but I cannot give too precise an answer. As ever, what happens will depend very much on the nature of the case. Broadly speaking, there is an area of responsibility for the QNCA and there are other areas of responsibility for the inspectorates—Ofsted, the FEFC and others that I have mentioned. It will depend to a large extent on the nature of the alleged problem who will have immediate responsibility to look into it.<br><br>
We need not and should not assume that the QNCA will always take the lead in looking into any and every difficulty that arises. Given that we have a number of different bodies with different remits and responsibilities, it must be right for an initial judgment to be made about to whom we should look to conduct the investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that our concern is in a sense in line with what he has said: that such instances could fall into a gap between the new inspecting body and the QNCA. We are seeking to ensure that there is somebody with whom the buck stops—that where there is financial misconduct, say, somebody takes responsibility in law. At present, it appears that the Minister is as uncertain as the Opposition of who would take that responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is, in his quest for information, almost being uncharitable—I do not say that he is but that he runs that risk. One can well imagine a parallel case of a problem arising, in a school for example, and people asking whom they should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0426">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 595</span>
approach to investigate it—the governing body, the LEA or Ofsted? Without knowing the details, I cannot say who would be responsible in such a case, but given the existence of the different and overlapping responsibilities, the hon. Gentleman can rest assured that the problem would be properly dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish I could take the Minister's word on that—but he drew a comparison with a school. I can give him the concrete example of the case of a grant-maintained school—no names—which I have raised with the Funding Agency for schools. Because it is a voluntary-aided school that is run by a religious order, some part of which claims charitable status, I was referred to the charity commissioners, who duly said, "Not me, guv—it must be the responsibility of the FAS." So I went back to the FAS. What did it say? It said "Not me, guv—it is the responsibility of the charity commissioners." That is a marvellous illustration of the situation that we fear will occur with the institutions referred to in the amendment; we fear that some people will fall through the middle because of quasi-Government organisations refusing to take responsibility. We make the simple suggestion that responsibilities in such cases be tied down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can understand that, but does one therefore say, "Well, here is a convenient new body, the QNCA, which looks as though it has pretty all-embracing powers; we'll just make it responsible for as many things as possible"? I do not think that that is the right approach. I say tentatively and subject, as ever, to advice—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Which is not forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You've noticed. I risk incurring the wrath of my boss in saying this, but I shall do so anyway. In the example that the hon. Gentleman gave, a form of recourse would be to the Secretary of State of the day, with all his or her responsibilities and wide powers under the statutes. One could say to him or her, "Here are two of your bodies that are apparently passing the buck to each other on an important issue; would you please bang their heads together?" I offer that possibility to the hon. Gentleman in a spirit of positive helpfulness. Were there a danger in the new regime that we are setting up, with the QNCA and the other bodies that I mentioned, of a similar problem of falling between two stools, one always has the ultimate recourse of saying to the Secretary of State that it is surely unacceptable that a problem in education is not being dealt with because two of the Secretary of State's bodies are failing to do so. I feel more comfortable resolving the problem that way than seeking to give the QNCA additional powers in its incipient, formative stage just in case a hypothetical problem should arise. There is a temptation, into which I probably occasionally fall, to give a body such as the QNCA every conceivable power, just in case. On reflection, however, the hon. Gentleman may realise that that is not altogether wise. I hope that he will accept that, while I am not denying the possibility that the kind of problem he outlined might occasionally occur, his is not the right solution to it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 596</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Minister honestly believes that mine is not the right solution to the problem, but it is significant that he does not deny that the problem might arise. The Minister recognised that immense powers will be given to the QNCA in circumstances where, as I said, the institution fails to satisfy the awarding body that it is undertaking the quality of procedures laid down. We are talking about the quality of procedures. If the new body is not responsible for that, I do not know who is. It is in that context that new clause 18 has been tabled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Staffordshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is quite right. The Minister mentioned Ofsted and FEFC inspectors. Funding bodies normally carry out inspections to ensure that the quality is right, but, in this instance, there is no funding body. In fact, there is an awarding body; the funding comes from employers or other individuals, hence there is no inspection capability. That is worrying. There is no funding body, so who will carry out inspections? My hon. Friend is right to pursue this mater.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. There are many concerns here. I do not believe that in this instance the Minister or his invisible friends and supporters have thought through the consequences of their proposal. Many awarding bodies will have major concerns about the failure to identify in the Bill who has responsibility for rogue institutions. Given the Minister's comments, I would normally beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion but, on this occasion, I will press it to a Division.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be aware that we have just approved three clauses, all of which deal with the external inspection and review of local education authorities, and we have done so without any disagreement. Clearly, the Committee unanimously supports the principle of external inspections and reviews of the functions of LEAs. Indeed, support for such a move goes far wider than the Committee—all the associations representing LEAs and the chief officers of LEAs are in favour of it because they believe that it will enhance public accountability. I have moved my amendment nevertheless because inherent in the proposals are some problems in connection with the inspection or review of the work of LEAs which we are perhaps not considering as fully as we should. It is easy to agree on the fundamental principle of inspections and reviews of LEAs, but we all accept that such work is serious.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
We know that school inspections must be done well and rigorously and that they can cause considerable anxiety for everyone involved. But in relation to such inspections, we are absolutely clear about what a school is: we know who is responsible for operating it and the tasks that it must accomplish; we know that each school has a clearly defined number of staff and pupils; we know its geographical site; and we know that it is charged with the education, within the national curriculum, of the pupils on its roll. Whatever Ofsted's faults it has built up a bank of experience in undertaking inspections within clearly defined parameters.<br><br>
Life is not as simple when we come to local education authorities, which are very different from schools. They are democratically elected bodies, which are coterminous with multipurpose local councils and legally indistinguishable from them. Local education authorities usually—but not exclusively—have an education department and a statutory chief education officer. But the authority itself, which is a body vested in the elected members, has powers and duties which may—and often do—go well beyond the bounds of the education department: it has powers, responsibilities and functions, in relation to social services, for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 598</span>
example, that are governed by completely different areas of statute law, but which nevertheless contribute to the discharge of its educational functions.<br><br>
The critical test is the volume of legislation that has been passed in recent years and the many Committee stages of Bills on education on which many of us have served, consolidated into the Education Act 1996, despite all of which there is still nothing in legislation giving a precise explanation of the scope of the local education authorities and their legal powers. The Government have implicitly, if not explicitly, recognised that problem. We need only examine the recent White Paper, "Self-Government for Schools", which led in part to the Bill that we are debating today. The whole of chapter 5 of that White Paper was devoted to the role of local education authorities yet it could not give a clear body of legislation setting out what local authorities should do.<br><br>
All those problems will make the process of inspecting local education authorities and judging their performance much more complex and difficult than Ofsted's task of inspecting schools, which is the body's major area of competence. No one disagrees that Ofsted should have a significant role in reviewing the quality of the local education authority's performance. Clearly, it is important to examine how schools are maintained and to draw inferences about how the local education authority is performing. The questions to be considered by the reviews go wider and deeper than that. In spite of the difficulties, surely some attempt should be made to get to grips with the role of the LEA as an authority that promotes education for the whole population of a specific geographic areas, in addition to its other responsibilities.<br><br>
There is another public body that has considerable experience in that respect, a body recognised by the Bill. It is the Audit Commission which, in pursuing its statutory functions, has already carried out several general investigations into certain LEA functions to support the work of the auditors of individual authorities. For example, many of us will recall that early in 1996 the commission produced the report "Counting up to five". That considered an issue of concern to many of us, namely the effectiveness of preschool education. The commission was able to take into account the discharge of local authorities' social service responsibilities and how they interact with education functions.<br><br>
The national study was supported by field work in individual authorities. The main report was supported by a number of technical annexes that will be of enormous value to auditors carrying out subsequent work in individual authorities. That model of operation was well established and has been applied to a range of studies.<br><br>
The Audit Commission is not, of course, always popular with Governments. You, Mr. O'Hara, may have been enjoying watching Sky television only last night when the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire), was challenged by me on whether he agreed with the commission's report "Trading Places". The report is about whether
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0428">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 599</span>
Government policy is enhancing parental choice and says that it is not. The Minister said, "No, no." He did not accept the report and thought it completely wrong. Nevertheless, that report exists. It was carried out by people who looked into the work done in local education authorities and it challenged some of what was taking place, including fundamental Government policy.<br><br>
The Audit Commission is well used to examining local authorities as total institutions. Its remit covers all the authorities' functions, including education. It has in the past collaborated in studies with Ofsted, in which it has looked specifically at schools. It has done useful collaborative work on, for instance, the control and employment of resources through the local management of schools.<br><br>
The importance of the Audit Commission cannot be overestimated. Clause 57 proposes that the chief inspector of schools may, if he wishes, ask the Audit Commission to become involved in a particular inspection or set of them. That is not good enough. The Audit Commission, with all its wealth of experience and its ability to go outside the sole education department remit of a local council, must be involved as of right if it believes that it can contribute to vital work that all of us agree needs to be done to review the work and functions of local education authorities.<br><br>
The amendment gives the Audit Commission the opportunity to involve itself in inspections carried out for the Secretary of State and the public at large by the chief inspector of schools and Ofsted, if the commission so wishes. That is a different view from that proposed by the Government. I hope that my approach will find favour on both sides of the Committee because it will ensure a greater and more effective form of scrutiny of the work of local education authorities. I hope that the Committee will approve, but I am sure that that greater scrutiny will find favour with all those involved in LEAs, who are keen that their work should be open to public scrutiny.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I back the hon. Gentleman's arguments in favour of amendment No. 229. Amendments Nos. 242 and 243, too, are intended to ensure that the Audit Commission is involved in the inspection of local authorities. Local education authorities would welcome being inspected, but are critical of the way in which the arrangements are set out in the Bill. Leeds education authority broadly welcomes the inspection proposal but is disappointed that the Bill takes a narrow view of LEAs.<br><br>
In addition to the functions mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, LEAs involve themselves in youth and community work and in broader community functions. The responsibilities of LEAs and social services departments interact, as I found when chairing the social services committee of a local authority. The LEAs also have a wider involvement in the process of community regeneration. If local education authorities are to be inspected properly, all their work—their total involvement—should be inspected.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 600</span>
For that reason, the most appropriate body to take part in such inspections is the Audit Commission; it has that wider experience of local authorities and is used to working with all departments of local government and to making specific studies of particular local authority services. The Audit Commission would add value to such inspections—indeed, its opinion would be critical.<br><br>
The inspection of local authorities, which have a range of functions, is a different matter from the inspections of schools. The chief inspector should not be given the option to decide—perhaps on the basis of his budget—whether or not the Audit Commission should be involved. People should know that those who inspect local education authorities have some knowledge of how local authorities work.<br><br>
Two reservations were expressed by Leeds education authority: first, it was worried about the scope of the inspection because of the wide range of local authority activities; secondly, it was concerned that those who undertook the inspections should have a real understanding of the nature of LEAs and how they operate. It is not appropriate to suggest that every inspection team should include someone who is aware of the way in which local authorities operate. However, the inclusion in the Bill of a provision to the effect that the Audit Commission should be directly involved in inspections would guarantee that those who did the work had some understanding of how local authorities works as a whole and of the nature of the local authority's accountability. The Audit Commission could contribute a great deal.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
I back up the comments of the hon. Member for Bath and hope that the Minister will bear in mind the Audit Commission's important contribution to education over the years. When I was a member of the commission the first studies relating to individual budgets for schools were undertaken. The commission's initial report on education has had a far-reaching effect on the way in which schools are financed and the power of decision given to them. The Audit Commission has produced many reports over the years. We know that the Government do not accept everything that the commission proposes. That is inevitable because the commission was created to be an independent body and has demonstrated its independence of Government. It has also demonstrated the high standard of its work.<br><br>
Recent reports have not been entirely acceptable to Departments. I mentioned some weeks ago the report on misspent youth, which also touches on some of the work of education departments. Some Ministers, including some Home Office Ministers, disagreed fundamentally with some aspects. Nevertheless, the fact that it has established such independence of Government and such a degree of authority makes it all the more valuable as a partner in inspections of local education authorities. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment and respond positively to what I think would be a great improvement to the Bill.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 601</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will try to reply briefly to the hon. Member for Bath and his "back up", the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South.<br><br>
I was pleased that the hon. Member for Bath acknowledged at this stage the universal agreement on this important process, which is well accepted. I recognise his concerns and those raised by the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South.<br><br>
A good track record of Ofsted and the Audit Commission working together has resulted in publications such as "Keeping Your Balance", and Ofsted and the commission have worked extremely successfully on the pilot LEA reviews. It is likely that Ofsted will seek liaison with the Audit Commission on subjects such as the budgetary issues of LEAs, as everyone knows.<br><br>
The clause as drafted is based on the successful model of joint working between Ofsted and the commission on the series of voluntary reviews by Ofsted of specific LEAs. In fact, Ofsted is already discussing with the Audit Commission how to take this forward following the enactment of the Bill. When clauses 54 and 58 are enacted, the chief inspector envisages continuing to draw on the Audit Commission's expertise, where appropriate, in looking at, for instance, such issues as support for the management and efficiency of schools.<br><br>
That points to Audit Commission involvement in the majority of inspections of LEAs within the programme. However, where the Secretary of State commissions an inspection under clause 54, he or she may wish to focus on particular themes, some of which may not require Audit Commission expertise. For example, we investigated an LEA that had a large number of failing schools. A requirement that the chief inspector involve the Audit Commission even when circumstances might not warrant it would not represent a cost-effective use of public money.<br><br>
The chief inspector is in charge, having overall responsibility for inspection, including meeting the full cost of the Audit Commission's contribution where he considers that it is needed. The amendment would be at odds with the effective management of this work, and I ask the Committee to reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response is disappointing. She said quite fairly that it is likely that Ofsted would seek the Audit Commission's support on, for example, financial issues. She also said that the HMCI will draw, where appropriate or where needed, on the advice and support of the Audit Commission. There is no doubt that that will be the case; there have been close working relationships in the past. But the Minister failed to recognise the complexity of the work of local education authorities and how it overlaps with other functions of local councils. She therefore failed to recognise that HMCI may not necessarily be in the best position to know whether the support of the Audit Commission would be advisable, as neither HMCI nor his staff has the necessary expertise in that area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that Ofsted does not have the expertise to carry out the inspections?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 602</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is trying to make mischief unnecessarily, which is unlike her. I am not suggesting that HMCI and Ofsted are incapable of carrying out reviews, but the Minister herself said that Ofsted does not necessarily have expertise in particular areas. That is why she said that HMCI will bring in the Audit Commission in some cases. The Minister herself acknowledges that there may be some deficiencies in total expertise within Ofsted in those areas that may still be part of the inspection to be carried out under its direction.<br><br>
There may be occasions when HMCI is not aware that it would be beneficial to bring in the Audit Commission; that is why the amendment proposes that the Audit Commission shall have the opportunity to become involved in the inspection if it deems it in the best interests of an efficient exercise of such an inspection or review. It is clear that the Minister has failed fully to comprehend the purport of the amendment. I should welcome an opportunity to discuss the matter on Report and thus give the Minister a chance to reflect on the issue. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 244, in page 43, line 4, leave out from '(6)' to second 'the' in line 5 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'The Chief Inspector shall pay to'.</p></blockquote>
I shall be brief, as the amendment is, in some respects, dependent upon the previous amendment, which has been withdrawn.<br><br>
Without the Audit Commission, the Minister's proposal leaves those who are inspecting short of the skills that would give the local education authority confidence that it was dealing with people who had some experience of the issues that an LEA faces. An LEA is not isolated; it is not a single body but part of something larger which operates democratically.<br><br>
It is clearly the Government's intention to over-fund the authority responsible, although they will not give the Audit Commission an open cheque. Indeed, that body is handicapped by lack of funds as a result of which it currently finds it very much harder to prosecute court cases because it does not have the funding that is available to those with whom it is dealing through the courts. We are considering a body that does not have an open-ended budget. I am concerned that the Audit Commission will not be called in to specific inspections simply on the basis of budget. It has a vital contribution to make to any inspection of a local education authority. That is why I tabled the amendment. We do not think it should be optional that the commission be involved and that its work be paid for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will come as no surprise to the Committee that as this amendment follows so closely on the previous group of amendments, I will not go into it in great detail. I have already said that involving the Audit Commission on every occasion would not represent a cost-effective use of public moneys. Clearly, the chief inspector needs to pay the Audit
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0430">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 603</span>
Commission only when its services are required, and the amendment would be at odds with the effective management of work.<br><br>
It is difficult at this stage to say exactly what would be the cost attracted by the Audit Commission's part of the work. The cost of inspecting an LEA is in the region of £90,000, which represents very good value for money.<br><br>
I ask the Committee to reject the amendment for the reasons that I have given against the previous group of amendments and against this amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's comments were inevitable, given her comments on the previous amendments. It is also inevitable that I shall ask leave to withdraw the amendment because it would have no point without the earlier amendments, which would have insisted that the Audit Commission be involved.<br><br>
In school inspections, as in many other things, we get what we pay for. Involving the commission would result in a far better—and better-respected—report on an LEA. We should involve people who have exprience not just of the educational work of an authority but of how the authority operates as a whole. Inspecting an authority is a very different matter from inspecting a school. I hope that we shall return to the matter, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p>I was going to say that I hope that I find the Minister in a charitable frame of mind towards the amendment, but we are not looking for charity—we are looking for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 604</span>
reasoned thought from the Minister. I am sure that she will come to the conclusion that the amendment is a reasoned and thoughtful one that is worthy of her support.<br><br>
There is agreement across the Committee that where a school has identified problems or areas in which it could be improved, the education authority has a role to play—not a sole or a separate role, but a role together with the school based on inspections carried out on it, which can identify problems and helpful ways to resolve them. The LEA has a role as one of the partners in the process of ensuring that all our children get the high quality of education to which they are entitled.<br><br>
One difficulty with current legislation was identified through correspondence between the Association of Metropolitan Authorities and Ofsted in 1994 and 1995. The AMA asked about the possibility of arranging for inspectors to discuss with the LEA the conclusions of their inspections and what the LEA might do to put right any problems or failings that had been identified in a particular school.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
The correspondence is interesting because the AMA first wrote to Ofsted in September 1994 and it took Ofsted nearly four months to respond. I am sure that the Minister is aware of the correspondence and the issues that it raised. Ofsted was not refusing to respond or wasting the four months; it was trying to be helpful in the difficult legal situation in which it found itself.<br><br>
The letter from Ofsted's director of inspection, Mike Tomlinson, apologises for the delay, and states:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am sympathetic to your concern that such feedback"—</p></blockquote>
inspectors feeding back information to LEA representatives—
<br><blockquote><p>"be made possible where circumstances allow and provided it is given in a correct and proper manner. I must, however, draw to your attention the legal obstacles which make this difficult to work in practice".</p></blockquote>
The letter identifies a number of problems on which Ofsted had clearly taken advice. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"HMCI has no power to require a Registered Inspector…to enter into dialogue with officers of a LEA".</p></blockquote>
Moreover, once the inspectors have written the report and sent it on to the prescribed parties, that is the end of the inspectors' responsibilities. The letter states that it is not part of the registered inspector's
<br><blockquote><p>"statutory function to give advice to the LEA or anyone else as to how improvements to the school could be made."</p></blockquote>
That seems to be a gap in current legislation and the Ofsted letter explores possibilities to get round that problem. It suggests that it might be possible in some circumstances for the LEA to come to an arrangement with the inspection team so that the LEA can receive some feedback after the inspection. Mr. Tomlinson concluded that if there were such an arrangement before the inspection took place, the impartiality of the inspectors might be brought into question, especially if any payment were to be made for that additional work, which inspectors are not required to do under current legislation. In other words, if the LEA said to the inspectors, "Come along after you have made your report to talk to us about it and here is a sum of money
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0431">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 605</span>
in consideration of the extra time that you have to put in", that could compromise the inspectors who, in law, must not have any connection with any school that they inspect. The legal advice was that an arrangement between the LEA and the inspectors might set up a connection.<br><br>
The letter goes on to state that it might be possible for the LEA to come to an arrangement with the inspectors to give feedback on the inspection only after that inspection had taken place. Again, if that was done regularly, the inspectors might assume before they begun their inspection that feedback would be asked for afterwards, which might bring into question their impartiality. Another possibility was that only in certain circumstances would the LEA ask after the event for feedback, but if it were known that feedback would generally be asked for when the inspectors' impartiality might again be called into question, especially if it were thought that they would be paid by the LEA only if they found failings.<br><br>
The Committee will recognise that there is a legal minefield. Even if it were possible to set up a separate meeting between the inspectors and the LEA, there might be a problem if LEA officers discussed with inspectors some issues that had not been specifically raised in the inspection report or otherwise mentioned to the school because the primary responsibility to deal with the report lies with the governing body of the school.<br><br>
All the letter came up with in the end was the suggestion that perhaps the LEA could send a representative to the governing body that discussed the inspector's report. That was not a terribly satisfactory conclusion. At the end of his letter, Mr. Tomlinson says:
<br><blockquote><p>"I regret that the limitations to adopting this approach might appear discouraging. I have striven not to rule out the possibility of allowing what you suggest, but I am mindful of the legal stricutres by which the system is bound".</p></blockquote>
Clearly, he was sympathetic to the idea that the LEA should have proper feedback and that it should be one of the partners, performing a proper role in helping schools with failings and difficulties in areas that needed improvement. The inspector's report is an important part in identifying elements in a school's activities that need improvement, but for the legal reasons, outlined in the letter, feedback to the LEA is not practical or possible at present.<br><br>
Our amendment would get round what must be an anomaly in the legislation. It is an oversight for which there is no legal provision at present. We hope that the Minister will accept our amendment in that spirit and allow LEAs to help out in circumstances when an inspector's report has identified that the school needs help.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) will probably find that I am in a slightly better mood than he anticipated, but I cannot accept his amendment. However, I do not want to disappoint him entirely. I appreciate the LEAs' desire to support their schools and I shall ask the chief
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 606</span>
inspector to arrange meetings with the local authority associations and other interested parties, followed by consultation, to see what new advice may be included in the handbook on the subject.<br><br>
The amendment is not acceptable because it would undermine the principle that schools are responsible for their own affairs and would duplicate many existing arrangements. It would impose a substantial additional financial and administrative burden on the inspection system. The inspection report is designed to be an objective and professional assessment of the school. It is sent to all those with an interest in the school, including the LEA where appropriate, and it is widely available.<br><br>
In a recent survey, more than 90 per cent. of schools expressed satisfaction with their report. I cannot emphasise too strongly that it is the governing body—not the LEA—which has the responsibility for preparing an action plan to respond to those reports.<br><br>
the amendment would duplicate exisitng arrangements. Registered inspectors already discuss the inspection findings with the school and its governing body. In the case of county or voluntary schools, the governing body may invite representatives of the LEA if it wishes to do so. It quite properly leaves the initiative with the school. The amendment would duplicate some of those arrangements at a cost of what could be as much as £25 million in the course of an inspection cycle. That cost arises because the registered inspector would have to make an additional visit to the LEA and would have to be paid more within the contract. In some cases, that could add one or two days to the time allowance for the inspection, which cannot be an effective use of resources.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the issue of the extra cost of carrying out the proposals in the amendment, I recall that in Wales, the money that the Welsh Office top-sliced from the education budget to pay for the new inspection system was more than the inspection system was costing. I wonder whether a similar thing happened in England and whether there were savings from the moneys that had been top-sliced to pay for the new inspection system. I know that that happened in Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to divert us from the purpose of the amendment. Any comments about top-slicing are best made elsewhere.<br><br>
The amendment would put the process of inspection in jeopardy by diverting registered inspectors from their main role. It is not their role to offer advice. To do so might open them to charges of reporting with an eye to offering advice subsequently and, therefore, of being less than objective. However, I will consider what has been said and I will ask the chief inspector to arrange meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify her views about the respective roles of the school and the local education authority after an inspector's report, particularly when a school has been deemed not to have been doing as well as it might?

local authority, thus appearing to aim responsibility at the authorities. Will the Minister make clear who has what responsibility? I have always assumed from reading her Department's press releases that local authorities have considerable responsibility, so how can she justify their not having access to inspectors who write reports?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, the local authority has access to the report. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris) is merely being divisive. She knows that the school governing body is responsible for responding to an inspector's report with an action plan.<br><br>
I will continue to ask the chief inspector to meet local authorities. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Attercliffe will withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has moved towards being helpful, and clearly thought that she was being helpful. The problem is that all the advice we have had from local authority associations is that legal changes have already happened. The letter from Mr. Tomlinson, which I read earlier, and the letter from the AMA were correspondence resulting from initial meetings between the association and HMCI. According to my advice from the AMA, HMCI was initially content for inspectors to discuss reports with LEAs. Only after HMCI sought advice from Ofsted's lawyers did that initial agreement prove impossible because of existing law.<br><br>
The problem is that further meetings will simply take us back to that point. Ofsted is happy for an arrangement to be made with inspectors, but its lawyers say that that cannot happen, so the only way in which meetings between inspectors and the local education authorities can happen is through a change in the law. That is what we are suggesting. I would like to accept the Minister's offer of intended help, but it comes about two years too late and will not solve the problem that I have identified. I must, therefore, press the amendment to a vote.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 251, in page 43, line 21, after 'applies', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'or attending youth service facilities'.</p></blockquote></p>

<br><blockquote><p>'personal development and guidance including'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Ms Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly to the amendments. We welcome the provisions in the Bill for careers education and guidance, which has always been an important part of education—now perhaps more than ever, with the changing employment patterns and job insecurity.<br><br>
The amendments explore whether the scope of careers education can be extended. I wish to make three points on that, the first of which is the most important. The Bill provides for careers education for people in school; will the Minister tell us the place of pupil referral units under the Bill in regard to that? I am sure that the Minister anticipates that careers education and guidance will be made available to pupils referral units who, as much if not more than most students, need them.<br><br>
I draw the Minister's attention to schedule 1 of the Education Act 1996, under which the Government for the first time give status to LEA's arrangements for the provision, as laid down in section 19 of the Act, of
<br><blockquote><p>"education at school or otherwise than at school".</p></blockquote>
That seems to be the first recognition in legislation of pupil referral units. LEAs have made provision for children outside the mainstream for some time and that legislation gave substance to that practice. The clause refers to careers education being made available to pupils in school, which raises the concern that under the 1996 Act, pupil referral units are defined as "otherwise than at school". Can the Minister respond to that anomaly? I do not suppose that he wishes pupil referral units to be excluded from the provisions of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My advice is that we are confident that pupil referral units are covered by provisions in the Bill and that there has not been an oversight. However, I shall look at the matter in more depth and write to the hon. Lady in response to that proper question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful; I look forward to the Minister's correspondence. As I said, our worry is not so much the wording of the Bill as the definition of the pupil referral unit in the 1996 Act.<br><br>
My second point is to explore where young people can get careers education and advice. Motivated children who are hooked into mainstream education are best given it within school; however, whether we like it or not, we have the problem of some children not attending school and not coming into the sort of contact with teachers on a daily basis that, under the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0433">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 609</span>
law, they should. In such cases, the youth service, which is often run by the local authority department that runs schools, becomes a home for those young people—a place where they can relate to adults and from which they can benefit because it is an environment different from that of school. Can the Minister confirm whether the youth service, as it is presently constituted—provided by both local authorities and voluntary agencies—has a responsibility to deal with careers education and guidance? Its strength is that it has access to and the confidence of young people who are slipping through mainstream education.<br><br>
As an ex-careers teacher, perhaps I feel more strongly about my third point than the Minister does. I refer to the definition of careers education. I want the Bill to include provisions relating to personal development and guidance. People may consider that we are quibbling about phraseology, but within education, there is a clear understanding of what personal development and guidance is as opposed to what careers education is. They are different sides of the same coin—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee has been egregiously well behaved during the sitting, but there is now rather a lot of subterranean noise. Will members of the Committee not be so noisy as to interrupt the hon. Member who is speaking?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. O'Hara, for your protection from those noisy Conservative Members on the Back Benches. Given that the troops are restless, I shall endeavour to be brief.<br><br>
There are essentially two processes with regard to careers advice and personal development. One is concerned with giving information to children on what the world of work, which they will soon enter, is about. The second process is concerned with helping them to develop their self-confidence and self-esteem, to know their strengths and their weaknesses and to develop their weaknesses so that they can become strengths.<br><br>
Parlance in education refers to careers education and personal development because it gives proper recognition to the two important sides of the process. Having raised those three important issues and having been satisfied with the Minister's comments on my most important point, will the Minister now consider this amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am already advised that pupil referral units are not currently covered by clause 59, but I am happy to say that we are proposing to table an amendment to ensure that they are covered. The hon. Member for Yardley has spotted an important point, for which I am grateful. She is absolutely right to say that pupil referral units are, and should be, regarded as an integral part of education. Where it is appropriate, young people who are being dealt with in such units, perhaps for an extended length of time or because, for whatever reason, they are unable to be returned promptly to mainstream provision, should receive such education and guidance. I say that not least
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 610</span>
because a large number of the pupils who are likely to be in pupil referral unit tend to be reaching their end of their compulsory schooling and are exactly in the age group that would require such guidance. I shall write to the hon. Lady to expand on what I have said, and I am grateful to her for raising the matter.<br><br>
It is a little more difficult to deal with the other matters that the hon. Lady has raised. We are trying to focus fairly directly on how best to improve careers education. It is an important area, as the hon. Lady probably knows better than anyone else in the Committee. I want to resist the temptation that she is placing before the Committee of trying to broaden the matter. I understand why she is trying to do so, but it is not appropriate. On the one hand, there would be a great risk in trying to bring the youth service and its activities and responsibilities into what is essentially an education matter. It would not be appropriate and it is not what the youth service is designed to do or could, indeed, do best. That is the thrust and the direction of one part of the amendment.<br><br>
On the other hand, I am not happy—even though the hon. Lady is—with the use of the term "personal development" or with the idea of putting it into the Bill. Perhaps "personal development" is like the proverbial cross between a camel and an elephant; it is difficult satisfactorily to define, but one knows it when one sees it.<br><br>
However, that is not a good enough reason to include such words in the Bill. The risk is that if we succumbed to the temptation, as the hon. Lady wishes, we would lose the important focus of this part of the Bill. The hon. Lady and I share the same objectives and I am glad that she believes that the thrust of part IX is important. It would be excessively risky to pretend that the youth service can suddenly do something that it was not designed to do, or to seek to broaden the thrust of the Bill by importing into it the concept of personal development, which cannot be satisfactorily defined yet could, if it was included in the Bill, be subject to inspection and so on. Another danger is that it would risk the dilution of the effectiveness of careers education. The hon. Lady may say that that was not her experience at school, but I hope that she accepts that to include personal development and guidance in the Bill and to hope that every school will deliver what she understands it to mean is an excessive risk. It would not add to the effectiveness of the careers education part of the Bill—indeed, it might dilute it.<br><br>
Although I understand the motivation for the amendments, they would not achieve what the hon. Lady hopes. Unacceptable risks are attached. For those reasons, I hope that she will see fit to withdraw the amendment. I am grateful to her for raising the point about pupil referral units. I hope to return to that subject and I shall write to her soon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the Minister will come back at a later stage with wording to answer the problems about pupil referral units.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 611</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the Minister's point about the youth service. Rather like my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Leeds, South, I could see the arguments against when I was preparing the amendment. I am happy to have raised the question of young people who do not relate to the school service but who clearly relate to youth provision. I hope that we can provide a framework in which young people can flourish and develop, but we should be aware that, for some children, much of what we are talking about is delivered by people other than teachers. That is the reality.<br><br>
I accept what the Minister said about the difficulty of including in the Bill an obligation for youth workers to provide careers education and guidance to those who might already receive it at school. As for careers education and personal development, I suppose that the Minister and I will have to agree to differ. Good teachers and effective schools cannot possibly deliver careers education without also delivering personal guidance. That is my view and I defy the Minister to find a good careers teacher or an effective head teacher who does not have a clear understanding of personal development. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>'(b) access for the person to a careers library within that institution:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(c) discussions among groups of such persons on careers matters; and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(d) facilities which are readily available, and where practicable within the premises of the institution, at which the persons may seek further information and advice as to careers matters.'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a paving amendment which would enable us to add three qualifications or criteria on which to build the careers service to which young people should have access. To an extent, these are also probing amendments, as we want to debate more publicly the access arrangements between schools and the careers service that the DFEE's choice and careers division is already discussing. I have a copy of "Providing Access to Schools for the Careers Service", a quite detailed document which has been the subject of discussion in the careers education guidance consultative group.<br><br>
We are trying to move beyond the rather generalised criteria included in the Bill, which mentions access to an interview and careers materials. The amendment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 612</span>
states that people should have access to a careers library within an institution, that they should be able to take part in discussion groups on careers-related matters and that facilities should be available where they can drop in and seek further advice.<br><br>
All those proposals are contained within the more detailed document to which I have referred, which the Department intends to publish in the spring to allow schools and colleges to develop their careers services. However, it would be helpful to define in the Bill the services that should be available to young people and to publish that document for wider consultation to discover schools' and colleges' views on how the service should be developed.<br><br>
There are also financial issues relating to the provision of an improved service. The Government estimate that clause 59 will cost about £15 million per annum. However, the Government claim that the cost of clause 61 is taken account of in the planned spending that they have already announced. The Government suggest in the financial memorandum that any
<br><blockquote><p>"additional burdens on LEAs and schools would be taken into account in the annual review of local authority spending needs."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will agree that including those three criteria in the Bill will help to ensure that statutory provision is made for the careers service. Perhaps he will say more about the expected costs because, if guidance is relied on, LEAs might have different responses. That might make it more difficult to work out the costings for the revenue support grant which allow the development of the sort of services that the Government want—such as those discussed in consultations and contained in the leaflet that they already propose to publish to enable LEAs and colleges to develop the service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising this matter, because it helps us to focus again on the importance of this part of the Bill.<br><br>
I confirm that the paper to which the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) referred will be issued in the spring. It will offer guidance on the access that schools and colleges should give to the career services and will go to schools and colleges, to the career service, to local education authorities and so on to try to achieve the ends that the hon. Gentleman described. However, it will be guidance: it will leave a degree of flexibility to schools, colleges and LEAs in the delivery of this important aspect of education to each institution in a locality.<br><br>
I was tempted by subsections (c) and (d) of amendment No. 249, which are reasonable, and I was half-way towards saying that the amendment would not do much harm and might actually improve the Bill. The trouble is that, in his enthusiasm, the hon. Gentleman got it wrong in subsection (b), which states that an institution must provide
<br><blockquote><p>"access for the person to a careers library within that institution".</p></blockquote>
Many institutions have careers libraries; we may say that ideally all should have them. But the hon. Gentleman knows as well as I do that not every institution can provide a careers library on its premises. The inclusion of such an absolute measure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0435">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 613</span>
and the turning of an aspiration into a requirement illustrates all too well a point that the Committee is weary of my making; it is one thing to state in guidance that when possible something should be done, but when one steps over that line and states in statute that there must be, for example, a careers library in every institution, the effect is spoilt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for what he has said so far. Subsection (b) was perhaps a little over-prescriptive, although clause 61 provides for access to guidance materials and a wide-range of up-to-date reference materials for potential users. If I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, will the Government table an amendment which will cover the matters referred to in subsections (c) and (d)?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am happy to say that we will do so. The hon. Gentleman sought to round out this part of the Bill. I want to look at the words he suggested to see whether we can strengthen the clause. I am grateful to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 614</span>
the hon. Gentleman for accepting that we must be careful not to be over-enthusiastic or over-prescriptive and, with the best possible motivation, put something in statute that cannot be guaranteed in every case. That would be bad law making and would put the institutions involved in a difficult, if not impossible, position. In the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman responded, I gladly give him the undertaking for which he asked.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
