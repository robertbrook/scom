	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of National Heritage (Mr. Iain Sproat)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Grants to the Churches Conservation Trust Order 1996.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the order is to specify the maximum level of Government grant to the Churches Conservation Trust over a three-year period. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for National Heritage is empowered to make such orders under section 1 of the Redundant Churches and other Religious Buildings Act 1969, with the approval of the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Churches Conservation Trust, formerly the Redundant Churches Fund, was established in 1969 under provisions currently embodied in the Pastoral Measure 1983. Its object is to care for Anglican churches of outstanding historic or architectural interest, which are redundant for pastoral purposes and for which no suitable alternative use can be found. Its chairman and trustees are appointed by Her Majesty on the advice of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, submitted through the Prime Minister. Since 1995, the trust has been fortunate to have my right hon. Friend the Member for the City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Brooke), as its chairman. As hon. Members may know, the preservation of our great ecclesiastical heritage is a subject close to his heart, and I am grateful to him for giving freely of his time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Historic church buildings—particularly those of the Church of England—are at the heart of our national heritage. For example, more than one third of our buildings listed grade 1 are Anglican parish churches. Churches are such a familiar and beautiful part of our English scene that they seem to be as permanent as the landscape itself. However, for a number of reasons, including mobility of the population in town and country, a small proportion—typically between 30 and 40 each year out of a total of 16,000—are no longer required for their original purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a statutory procedure for declaring such a church redundant. Most redundant churches are found other suitable uses: as places of worship for other denominations: concert halls; offices; or even houses. But where no suitable use is available for a church of historic, architectural or archaeological importance, its future can be secured by vesting in the Churches Conservation Trust. The decision on
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
whether to vest a church in the trust is taken by the Church Commissioners in the light of expert advice from the Advisory Board for Redundant Churches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trust is the expression of a partnership between Church and state and it is funded jointly by the Government and the Church Commissioners. The trust's expenditure is devoted to the repair and maintenance of the churches in its care. These currently number more than 300 and their variety is remarkable—ranging from 18th and 19th-century inner-city churches like St. Thomas, Bristol and Holy Trinity, Blackburn, to rural ones such as 12th-century St. Mary Magdalene in Tortington in West Sussex, and 14th-century St. James in Luffincott in Devon. If the trust did not exist, some of those churches would face neglect, conversion to uses involving damaging alterations, or even demolition. Fortunately, this is not the case, and churches vested in the trust continue to be a focus in their localities, and remain accessible to the public. The trust can be justly proud of its achievements in preserving so many churches for future generations to enjoy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order provides for grants to the trust in the three-year period, 1 April 1997 to 31 March 2000, up to a maximum of £7.44 million. That is an aggregate of the public expenditure survey's figures, already made public, for the next three financial years, and notified to the trust for planning purposes—£2.48 million for each of the three years. The maximum figure has been approved by the Treasury, and the order requires the signature of two Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, as well as that of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. The actual level of grant allocated to the trust continues to be determined annually in accordance with normal public expenditure survey procedures, within the limits of the maximum figure, which the order specifies for the three-year period as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures also represent the Government's continued commitment to bear 70 per cent. of the costs of the trust, with the Church Commissioners providing the remaining 30 per cent. It is worth reminding the Committee that the Government's share of those costs has risen steadily over the years. For the first 10 years of the trust's existence it stood at only 40 per cent. and reached 70 per cent. in 1989. The Church Commissioners' contribution for the triennium has been provisionally set at £3·18 million and the General Synod is expected to approve that later this month. Therefore, the trust's maximum overall budget amounts to £1062 million for the coming triennium, as against £10·26 million for 1994–97.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the financial constraints of recent years, I am pleased to report that the trust has coped well, and achieved much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trust has undertaken repairs of various degrees of seriousness and cost to no fewer than 223 churches during the present triennium, more than 73 per cent. of its stock. An additional 18 churches are expected to be vested in the trust before the end of the current triennium. I pay tribute to the dedication and hard work of all those working for the trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The launch of the national lottery has been of great significance for the funding of the heritage, and that includes the ecclesiastical heritage. Hon. Members may be aware that last month saw the establishment by the heritage lottery fund and English Heritage of a joint funding scheme for churches in use. That will pool lottery and English Heritage resources to create one source of funding—£20 million has been set aside to fund the scheme in its first year. Lottery funding is also available for redundant churches, and I understand that the heritage lottery fund is now considering an application from the Church Commissioners for the late 19th century Christ church, Waterloo, Liverpool. The trust will be considering whether to submit bids to the heritage lottery fund in appropriate cases. The lottery represents a major opportunity for heritage organisations such as the trust to come up with imaginative schemes for the restoration, preservation and enhancement of the ecclesiastical heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order represents the Government's continuing commitment to the care of an outstanding part of our heritage. It will help to secure the long-term preservation of some of our loveliest and, historically, most significant churches. It will ensure that buildings which have stood at the very heart of the local community for hundreds of years are properly cared for, and that they will remain available for our enjoyment and that of those who come after us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the draft order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.36 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Fisher 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the Minister, I welcome the opportunity for a brief debate on the increases that arise from the order. The Opposition will, of course, support the trust's work, its aims and objectives. The excellence of that work was demonstrated by its annual report, which was notably well written and produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new triennium represents an interesting opportunity as it is the beginning of three more years of the trust's work. As the Minister said, a new chairman, the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South, has been appointed and that will have been welcomed by every hon. Member in view of his great experience of and interest in such matters. But this is also an appropriate moment to put on record the House's thanks to the outgoing chairman, Mr. Gordon Burrett, who, by all accounts, has done a remarkable job in the past 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report also suggests that, for quite a considerable sum of public money, we are receiving good value. The staff is surprisingly small; it is questionable whether it is too small for the future development of the trust's work with staffing costs of only 10 per cent. of the total, which compares favourably with the work of similar organisations. The money is being well spent and the work is good, but it would be interesting to hear the Minister's comments on one or two matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is noticeable from the annual report that the geographic distribution of the trust's estate—the churches that are vested—is surprisingly uneven.
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
There are very few metropolitan inner-city churches—almost none in inner-city London or Manchester or Birmingham, one in Toxteth, one or two in Leeds and one in Bristol—and the make-up of the trust's estate is essentially rural. Indeed, it is concentrated in very few counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would expect counties such as Norfolk, which has a great ecclesiastical tradition, to have more than the average number of redundant churches suitable for protection by the trust. Norfolk has 25 such churches and Suffolk 19, and that is also true in other counties, such as Wiltshire, Hereford and Worcester, Lincolnshire and North Yorkshire. Churches in those six counties make up more than a third of the national estate of the trust. In some counties where we might equally expect there to be a considerable number of redundant churches—Cornwall, Cleveland, Devon, Cheshire, Shropshire and Staffordshire—there are surprisingly few. The trust cannot determine or influence the churches that are referred to it by the diocese and the Church Commissioners. I wonder what conclusions we should draw from that, and whether there are concerns arising from the flow of churches coming within the protection of the trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the considerations that dioceses give in the five-year quarantine period. They look, as he said, at other uses; I think everyone welcomes their use by other denominations or for cultural purposes. But with the Church and some dioceses under increasing financial pressure, dioceses may be looking too enthusiastically at out-and-out commercial uses of churches, especially in inner-city areas where the development potential of the land is considerable. If that trend means that the community is losing important churches, that is a worry. The matter does not come within the remit of the trust, but it should be given some consideration. This is a national trust, representing an important national body of churches of significant architectural and heritage value. At present, this is a surprisingly uneven estate and that should be noted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matter that struck me from the annual report was the surprisingly small amount of money spent on publicity. Given the quality and size of the estate—300 churches is a considerable national resource—perhaps the trust is hiding its light under a bushel. In the next three-year period, I wonder whether the Minister will join me in encouraging the trust to take a more positive attitude towards publicity. I, for instance, was very ignorant of the work of the trust until a few days ago. It is a remarkable organisation, and I think that the public are missing out when it comes to information about this important heritage resource. Slightly more money spent on publicity and publications would be in everyone's interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is notable in the annual report that the trust produced 25 pamphlets last year. However, bodies such as the Historic Houses Association consolidate those into registers and national publications. I wonder whether the new trust will go in that direction under its new chairman. Perhaps it might be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
encouraged by the Minister, when he gives the grant, to consider that as a more positive aspect of work over the next three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Churches are also an increasingly important educational resource, especially in some counties. The Government, quite rightly, stressed history education in the national curriculum, encouraging visits to primary sources, for example, sites and buildings, that can illustrate local history to children and bring it alive. In some counties, the group of churches for which the trust is responsible offers a great educational resource. I hope that over the next three years the Minister will encourage the trust to develop educational partnership agreements with the education authorities, particularly in those counties where there is a concentration of churches, because more educational work would benefit everybody. It would bring the work of the trust to a wider public and would be a great resource for those communities. The excellent educational work that the National Trust has done over the past few years is a model for partnership agreements and working between a body such as the trust and educational authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, similarly, potential for cultural agreements with local authorities, almost all of which have now signed up to arts and cultural policies in conjunction with their regional arts boards. As the Minister said, the use of such church buildings as performance spaces in rural communities—which often conspicuously lack such opportunities—and as meeting places for discussion, concerts and other performances is considerable, apart from their use for occasional services. The need is there, and many of the churches have great potential. Indeed, I understand that the church in Shrewsbury held more than 25 concerts last year. I for one would like to see the trust developing its great resource in the next three years. I hope that the Minister in passing on the grant—and the House in approving it—will support the trust's work as it develops both its cultural and educational remits and greater publicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on both sides of the House will welcome the grant, but there is a question mark over whether it is enough or too much. I note that last year's vestings was not entirely spent up. I do not understand the reasons for that, or the budget for vestings—perhaps the Minister would clarify the position. Due, however, to the excellence of the trust's work, all hon. Members would want to support the order and wish the trust well over the next three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.47 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark and Bermondsey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the order is welcome. If we did not vote for it, there would be rebellion in the shires and elsewhere. We are therefore glad to say yes to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My mental arithmetic is not normally too bad, but I am struggling a bit this morning. I worked out from what the Minister said that the triennial increase, all things taken together, is £0.4 million, which I think, over three years, is better than inflation. I would be
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
grateful if someone would tell me whether it is relatively getting better or relatively being tied down by public expenditure restraints. It would be helpful to see the actual grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a couple of queries and comments following on from the speech of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher). First, will the Minister say how the Government and, indeed, the trust see things developing over the next four years in terms of the funding of those churches that come within the remit of the fund, given the announcement of the Secretary of State for National Heritage and the confirmation by the Minister that redundant churches are eligible for lottery and other funding? In October, the new regime was trailed by the Secretary of State in her answer in the House to the hon. Member for Edmonton (Dr. Twinn) as
	<br><blockquote><p>"an … initiative to streamline assistance for churches".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 14 October 1996; Vol. 282, c. 449.]</p></blockquote>
I understand that that means that millennium and lottery fund grants are now coming together, but it would be helpful to know whether those funds will be separate from, and awarded under different criteria to, the money going to the churches that are in the purview of the fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I want to join the tributes in response to the appointment of our colleague the right hon. Member for City of London and Westminster, South, the former Secretary of State for National Heritage. From all that I have heard and seen, he is one of the most—if not the most—erudite Members of the House and is highly qualified to do the job. I welcome him to his new post. There are many—probably more—redundant churches in the right hon. Gentleman's constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are not in the fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that they are not in the fund, but they are redundant churches. Paradoxically, although most of them are not in the fund, that is a good thing in many ways, because they have been put to other uses. I see that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central is looking quizzical. Perhaps the Minister can tell us—I am not up to date on this—whether, as a result of the inquiry into the churches in the City of London, some of those churches are likely to become part of the trust for their protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third question arises out of ignorance. What formula is there for the protection and care of redundant churches and chapels of other denominations? That question is often asked in the House. What are the current arrangements? Is there another fund that looks after chapels and non-Anglican churches, or are they catered for by another method? We would all want significant places of worship, no matter what their denomination, to be protected and supported in the same way.

I shall now look ahead to the next three years, which will take the trust up to the eve of the millennium. One of the points made by the Prince of Wales, which concerns many of us, is that the millennium should be not only a national party but a proper commemoration of the Christian faith and the

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Christian Church, and its presence and influence in the United Kingdom or, in this case, England. There is a great opportunity—this comment is complementary to that made by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central—in the run-up to the celebration of the millennium to use churches in a coherent, educative and culturally helpful way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful to use such churches as education centres. Southwark cathedral—which is very much alive and not at all redundant—in my constituency has just opened an education centre. I was there to watch youngsters from primary schools living church tradition and history through making mosaics—I had a hand in making one little square, which I had never done before so that was an education for me—dressing up and joining processions. It was helpful to be able to touch objects, share experiences and do a little acting and drama. Kids love such activities and when they are held in empty churches, they do not conflict with other uses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one use that can be made of empty churches. There is another. I stand to be corrected if I am wrong, but we do not yet have an annual day or weekend for all redundant churches to open their doors. In London in September there was a day when buildings such as City churches that are normally locked and which one has to make arrangements to visit were opened to the public. That was welcome and I was invited, but was unable, to go on a tour of City churches which I have never been inside. There is a benefit in having such a day which is flagged up and publicised around the country. I discovered the other day that this is neighbourhood watch week. It may be beneficial to have an English churches week and promote it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of churches under the fund's umbrella is gradually creeping up. The Minister said that there were now more than 300 such churches and that the figure has crept up from 290 in April 1994, so it has gone up by another 10 to 20 churches. It would be helpful to know whether there are others in the pipeline which have been declared redundant, are unlikely to be used for other purposes and are anticipating coming into the trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also be helpful if the Minister would tell us—I could probably have found this information myself and I apologise for not doing so—whether there is any limit to the total grant available to any particular church from the fund or whether each and every church depends entirely on the merit of its bid each year. If the latter were the case and a church needed to spend a huge sum of money, it could take, for example, £500,000 of the grant. Research by my assistant shows that the current average is about £24,000 per church, which is as if the money were shared equally. That is not a huge sum in terms of building works, materials, conservation and so on. Will the strategy be to continue to spend large sums on the churches that need more significant investment as opposed to offering rough parity to all of those within the portfolio, to use a rather inappropriate word?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The churches are a glorious part of our heritage. We want them to be conserved. I am happy that we now use the name the Churches Conservation Trust and
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
not the Redundant Churches Fund. That is a much more acceptable title. We wish the fund well, thank the officers and the board for their work and look forward to the churches becoming an even better known and publicised part of our heritage in the years up to the millennium.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I respond briefly to the speeches of the hon. Members for Stoke-on-Trent, Central and for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes)? I thank them for their support and will ensure that my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South, the former Secretary of State for National Heritage, is appraised of their kind remarks. I shall also ensure that the trust knows of the comments of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central about good value for money. It is an extremely lean, well run body from which other bodies might learn a lesson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned urban churches and the differing spread in rural areas. There are fewer churches in the trust in urban areas for the simple, practical reason that it is easier to find other uses in urban rather than rural areas. I take on board what he said about the fact that, in his opinion—I do not say that pejoratively, but neutrally—some of the uses are over-commercial. I shall draw his remarks to the trust's attention, but a redundant church is not given a use without the approval of the Church Commissioners. Ecclesiastical imagination is at play on whether the new use is suitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In rural areas, the trust responds where demand arises. There is no other reason for there being fewer churches in use. The hon. Gentleman said that churches in Norfolk and Suffolk were being heavily supported by the trust, I believe that is because there are more mediaeval churches in Norfolk than in the rest of Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Peter L. Pike 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Burnley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's point that there are many alternative uses of churches and that it is easier to implement them in urban areas. But what is the long-term situation? Will an acceptable use of a former chuch be considered to be a long-term commitment? It is no good a church being used unacceptably, albeit for only a relatively short time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. There can be no guarantee, but if the second use of a redundant church ends another use has to be found. The principles which applied to the first use will apply to the second, mainly that the Church Commissioners have to agree it. If not, a church would become eligible for help from the trust. There is no guarantee, but the same procedure would apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On rural churches, it may be that some dioceses are much better at and have greater funds for preserving their churches. They may not come forward to the commissioners for consideration during the quarantine period and therefore, may not be covered by the trust. However, it is surprising that some dioceses where there are few churches are so much
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
better than others at making use of those churches or have a much smaller body of potentially redundant churches. That leads on the Ministers' second point, which was about other uses. My questioning and implicit criticism is certainly not of the trust—what happens is without its influence—but is more of dioceses and the Church Commissioners who, under pressure of financial constraints, have sometimes been too enthusiastic about commercial uses. For example, the diocese and the Church Commissioners were too ready to convert the church of St. John's, Hanley, in my constituency into a climbing centre—a strange commercial use—when it still had considerable potential for community use. I suspect that that pattern may may be followed elsewhere in the country as the dioceses and the Church Commissioners respond to financial difficulty. However, it is an unhelpful and unattractive trend which denies churches the opportunity to come forward and be vested by the trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an interesting point. I do not have a great deal of control over such matters, but I shall draw the hon. Gentleman's remarks to the attention of my right hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Alison). No doubt he will pass the matter on to the Archbishop of Canterbury, as he sees fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the trust taking a more positive attitude to publicity: although the trust is examining the matter, I hope that a more positive attitude to publicity will not mean that substantial resources will be diverted from redundant churches, which must remain the trust's main concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister, but it may be acceptable for the publicity exercise to be funded commercially.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Church authorities and the trust could well look into that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a good idea to encourage school visits to churches in trust. Schools regularly visit museums and churches, and if I can think of a way to promote such visits without great resource implications I shall do so. I agree that it would be a jolly good thing to do, but establishing the bureaucracy involved in writing to 24,000 schools in England and Wales, paying for the stamps and waiting for the schools to reply is a complicated process. However, I shall see that the suggestion is given attention in the proper quarters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Establishing educational partnerships between trusts, schools, local education authorities, grant-maintained schools and so on is an interesting idea but I do not want bureaucracy to divert resources too far from the main work of the trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are proceeding so well I am loathe to intervene with one more sentence, but, although I agree with the Minister that resources must not be wasted on additional information that could be made part of the annual publicity mechanism, it is important that the promotion of use of redundant churches by schools should not be based on an entry charge. That is a serious point. An entry charge is a real deterrent to school visits—I am chairman of a school's board of governors and I know about the financial pressures that exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sproat</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point. All hon. Members know that schools complain endlessly about the amount of money that they are charged for use of the local community sports centres. However, if no charge is levied, how are such sports centres supposed to remain open? There is a balance to be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey that the heritage lottery fund and English Heritage are to fund the £20 million, not the Millennium Fund. I expect that that was a slip of the tongue, but I should point out that that money is for churches that are still in use, not for redundant churches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's point about synagogues, Unitarian chapels and Roman Catholic churches is covered by the Historic Chapels Trust, set up in 1993 with help from the Department of National Heritage. Currently, it is funded through English Heritage and private sector sources: in fact, it is run by the wife of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the right hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Freeman), who I think just stuck his head round the door.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I undertake to draw to the attention of the trust the proposal to use churches in a coherent way—for example, as education centres—in the new millennium, as I will the proposal that there should be one day on which all churches are open. In fact, 95 per cent. of churches in trust are open at various times throughout the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can confirm that the increase in funds is above the rate of inflation at 3.5 per cent., although I must state that I am indebted to my wise officials for that figure. Also, there are nine other churches in the pipeline for inclusion by the trust. The allocation of moneys is a matter for the trust, but I shall draw the Committee's comments to the trust's attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
