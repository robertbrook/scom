</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say at the outset, Mr. O'Hara, that, given your previous ruling, the amendments will be extremely difficult to discuss. I respect your ruling, but I feel that it is appropriate to put the difficulty on the record. Clause 9 deals with the procedures that should be undertaken if, and when, grant-maintained schools increase their numbers. The fact that clause 3 was disagreed to makes nonsense of the amendments. I am slightly unclear about what procedure to follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the hon. Lady. She is entitled to draw attention to those alleged difficulties during the debate and the Minister will have the opportunity to respond to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>292</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The prime difficulty is that we have decided that grant-maintained schools cannot increase their admission numbers without going through appropriate procedures. However, I am sure that the Minister will attempt to deal with the matter. The amendments would put in the Bill a requirement to consult, a matter on which I shall not elaborate as we have already debated the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said previously that such a requirement does not need to be in the Bill and that circulars will suffice. He then referred to the type of organisations that would be consulted, something on which there is not much distance between the two sides of the Committee. It is a little difficult for Opposition Members and the public, however, to take seriously and accept the hon. Gentleman's undertaking that the circular will include such information because the Government's record on trust is not good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past few days, we have been debating taxation and the Budget on the Floor of the House and we know that the Government broke their promise 22 times. They assured the British people that they would reduce tax but, in fact, they increased it. That shows why we cannot trust that the circulars will provide details of the consultation process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to interrupt the hon. Lady's delivery of what is a rather cheap political point at this stage in our proceedings, except to say that she has kindly acknowledged that I have said repeatedly that we shall be consulting on the nature of the consultation process and on the guidance that we intend to issue. She may accede also that I have given some pretty strong hints about what the guidance is likely to contain. I hope that she will not press me too hard for details of the consultation process because, were I to give them, I should be in danger of undermining that very process. The hon. Lady might then say that the consultation would be an empty process. Surely she will have a little sympathy for me and understand the dilemma in which I find myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have enormous sympathy for the Minister, particularly because of what happened earlier this week, when common sense prevailed and we knocked out clause 3. However, putting the number of consultees in the Bill would not prevent the Minister adding to that number by circular after further consultation. I do not accept the logic of his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 148 would ensure the approval of the Funding Agency for Schools and consultation with local education authorities. I know that Ministers feel hugh hostility to LEAs, but we are asking that the funding agency, which will fund any increase in admissions, should approve a school's commitment to that increase but that the LEA should merely be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument is based on cost-efficiency and effectiveness. The thrust of our debates has been odd, to say the least. Section 500 of the Education Act 1996 gives the Secretary of State the power to direct the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>293</span>
Funding Agency for Schools or the LEAs to make proposals to remedy an excessive provision of places. Last year, Ministers expressed concern about excess places; they were so concerned that section 502 was added to the 1996 Act to give the Secretary of State the power to intervene should the LEAs or the FAS fail to make such proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill—without clause 3, which makes it difficult for us to debate the matter—could easily result in surplus places. Why have Ministers had a sudden change of heart? Why are they not pursuing cost-efficiency and effectiveness at a time of public expenditure constraints? Surely Ministers have a fiduciary duty to ensure that all money is spent efficiently and effectively. Not allowing all those responsible—the LEAs, the FAS or even the Secretary of State—to deal expeditiously with surplus places means that they will not be able to fulfil those fiduciary duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are coming to that time of year when next year's school budgets are being considered. There will doubtless be arguments on the Floor of the House and debates in the public arena, with the Government saying that they have funded education to greater effect and that schools are cutting the number of teachers because of their inefficiency. Whenever the Government talk about LEA inefficiency, they point to the waste of surplus places, yet the Bill could lead to more surplus places, with no fiduciary duty to ensure control over the number of places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An Audit Commission report is floating around—it is stuck somewhere in the Department for Education and Employment—which tackles the problem of surplus places. It would be extremely helpful to our debate if we could hear the commission's wisdom. Where is that report? Can we see it? It is important to our consideration of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Audit Commission was set up by Government but it is independent of them. I should have thought it extremely unusual for the Government to be able to block the publication of a report or data that the commission wished to be published. If the report is held up within the Department for Education and Employment, will the Minister of State explain why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend was a member of the Audit Commission in its early days. There was some suspicion in local government about the commission because we thought that it had been established simply to attack us, but it has sometimes made the Government feel uncomfortable. I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response on this matter, but I think that the Government are delaying publication because the report is embarrassing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is important, first because of the issues of cost-effectiveness and efficiency connected with surplus places and, secondly, the effect on other schools, something with which we dealt at considerable length during the previous sitting.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>294</span>
Contrary to the allegation that one of the Ministers made, there is no Opposition Member who does not want to support popular and good schools. We all want to celebrate success and support good practice which makes schools pupular, but as those responsible for creating and administering public policy—the role of central Government—we have a duty to raise standards for British children throughout the education system and not just in a few schools, so that we become properly competitive in the global economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who attended yesterday's sitting of the Select Committee on Education and Employment and heard the chief inspector of schools will recall that he yet again referred to the fact that British children are performing far less well that their counterparts in France and Germany where two thirds of children gain the equivalent of five GCSE grades A to C, whereas fewer than 30 per cent. of children in this country do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A policy that focuses on a few schools, allowing them to increase admissions, could worsen the education of many children in other schools. Ministers have not responded to the argument that that policy will increase and extenuate the long tail of underachievement, which is the basic problem of the British educational system. That policy will lessen the ability of other schools to be good, effective institutions of learning—they will have less money because money follows the children. It will make it more difficult for schools to compete, offer the national curriculum or sustain their sixth forms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of Government should be to put in place structures that improve, rather than worsen, the problem of the long tail of underachievement. Until the Minister of State can deal with that matter intellectually coherently, he will have lost the argument on many of the Bill's provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried that clause 9 contains no guide to governors on the capacity of schools to accommodate pupils. I think that Ministers would accept that governors are often not familiar with health and safety policies and, therefore, the health and safety implications of increasing pupil numbers, so clear guidance on such matters is necessary. A desire to increase the number of pupils—thus attracting additional funds, if places are filled—might well increase numbers beyond that which is desirable for the effective provision of education health and safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no compulsion on governors to consult parents if they decide to increase numbers. Parents of existing pupils have a legitimate interest in the size of the school and the implications for their children if the total number of pupils on the roll is to be increased. Parents might well be influenced by size when choosing a school—if they choose a school that has 900 pupils and it suddenly increases its size by 50 per cent. to 1,350 pupils, that might affect their choice. They should surely have a say if governors decide to increase numbers. I would be most grateful if a Minister would reply to that point.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>295</span>
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting thing about how the clause is framed is that it appears that parents will have no say at all about an increase in a school's size, but that governing bodies will consult if they are considering decreasing a school's size. I do not understand the logic of differentiating between consultation on increases in numbers and consultation on decreases in numbers, unless that is again to do with political dogma about grant-maintained schools, rather than the interests of parents and parental choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 149 would ensure that local education authorities would be consulted before a grant-maintained school reduced its number of places. Again, that is perfectly sensible because a reduction in places made by a grant-maintained school could have an impact on a local education authority's ability to meet its statutory responsibilities to provide places. Implicitly, the Government accept that because they have taken such care to ensure that the funding agency will be consulted about a reduction in numbers, while it will not be consulted about an increase in numbers. So again there is an inconsistency—there will be consultation about a decrease but no consultation about an increase—which appears odd, to say the least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, the amendments relate to consultation about provisions of a clause that we have defeated, so perhaps the Minister will address the question of whether he should not withdraw the whole of clause 9 as a direct result of the decision that the Committee quite properly and democratically took on Tuesday to delete clause 3. That would probably be the most logical step, but if the Minister chooses not to withdraw the clause, he ought at least to accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is always a risk at this stage of a Committee that we begin to recognise the arguments being made. I sensed a certain familiarity with some of what the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge), said, although I may have been mistaken. I was listening for new material but could not find it; perhaps that is due mainly to my failing memory—I can promise that it is certainly not due to any inattentiveness on my part. I shall be fairly brief in my reply, because there is a danger that otherwise that reply itself might end up being a bit repetitive. I would not want to weary the Committee with a reptitive reply; that would certainly not do, given the progress that I am sure that we all want to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, in brief, I pick up a phrase used by the hon. Lady—that she wants to include the consultees in the Bill. That rather summarises our differences of view to date in Committee, and may well continue to do so. Over and over again, by argument—my health warning, almost—to the Committee has been that however tempting it may seem to include things in the Bill and whatever sense of security that may give people, that sets the Bill's provisions in concrete. We all know—whether we happen to be in Government at present or serve the House in other capacities—that as soon as something is included in an Act it is difficult to change it. My inclination is always to say that the Bill,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>296</span>
when enacted, will provide the framework and the philosophy of the measure to be undertaken. It is folly to try to put too much detail in the Bill because that makes it so inflexible. Time and again we say that we prefer to deal with such matters through guidance or by making regulations, after having consulted properly. Despite the hon. Lady being at her most charming, seductive and tempting, I must resist the temptation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Evennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Erith and Crayford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Especially at this time of the morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Especially at this time of the morning, as my hon. Friend says. It is not sensible or proper for me to pre-empt the consultation process, but I have given some pretty broad hints as to what I think the report might say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sense that the Minister is not going to answer in detail the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Barking raised. On the Question of consultation, he made a specific accusation that the Government had held up an Audit Commission survey. The only way that they could hold it up is during the consultation process because they would be consulted about their views on surplus places. Will the Minister say whether it has been held up by the Government? His Department is continually consulted and it would not do if it held up valuable information on how schools are organised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the one new point in the hon. Lady's speech and I am happy to deal with it. I am aware of an Audit Commission draft report on the matter and believe that the normal coversations are taking place at official level. I have no doubt that the report will emerge in due course, but it is the Audit Commission, not my Department, that has control over its publication. As a modest participant in my Department's activities from time to time, I should have thought that I might catch sight of that report, by I have not done so as yet. If anyone is holding it up, it ain't me. I have not seen it yet, but when I do I am sure that I shall be so thrilled with its contents that I shall want it to be made public as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister accepts that the report is in his Department, so I hope that he has sufficient control over his officials to get rapid sight of it. We understand that the report is being held up because of the consultation that is taking place in his Department. It would be extremely beneficial for our consideration of the Bill if the report were published, so that we could have an objective analysis as part of our informed debate. Will the Minister undertake to have the report cleared for publication by the Report stage of the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give such an undertaking. I detect that the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) think that they are on to a real nugget. They are quite excited at the possibility that something has come up that might embarrass me. I have to tell them that I am virtually unembarrassable on this, or anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>297</span>
The truth, as ever, is much less dramatic and much less fun. The Audit Commission has prepared a draft report, which is being discussed, in the usual way, by the Audit Commission and my Department. I understand that that process is under way, so it would be improper for me to influence my officials in the discharge of their duties. I give no undertaking to either the hon. Lady or her hon. Friend to interfere in a perfectly proper process of discussion and consultation between the Audit Commission and my Department. I am sure that the commission will publish its report when it is ready to so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Audit Commission is not dependent on the Department to publish its report, but it is usual practice to consult the Department for its views. The Audit Commission's views are independent and may not agree with the Department's views. Because it is an independent report, it is all the more important that we know its view on surplus places and what action local authorities and the Government can take to reduce them. We contend that measures in the Bill will increase the number of surplus places. Surely the Minister would welcome an independent view on the factors that cause surplus places—if he does not, surely he would at least welcome the economic management of schools. The role of the Audit Commission is to implement economy, efficiency and effectiveness; surplus places do not further those interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a bit reluctant to accept lectures, even from the hon. Gentleman, on surplus places in schools. He may recall that it was Government pressure over the past few years that caused many local authorities—mostly those controlled by his own party—to reduce the gratuitous surplus places and consequent waste of educational resources that had existed in their schools for many years. However, a balance has to be struck so that we implement not a ruthless drive to eliminate everything that could be described as a surplus place, but a reasonable provision for a certain amount of spare capacity to allow for demographic pressures, natural movement of pupils or an element of choice in the system.

I have already wearied the Committee by saying several times that our circular 23/94 laid out all those matters, in an interesting way, two years ago. A great change took place whereby we not only allowed but encouraged a process that maximises parental choice and the freedom and flexibility of schools to respond to parental pressure for additional places in popular schools by allowing surplus places to increase in some instances, to be dealt with subsequently in the normal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South has not discovered something dramatically new. He has simply illustrated, from a perspective slightly different from my own, that a possibility exists. If the Audit Commission were to announce that it supported a ruthless, inexorable drive to minimise narrowly defined surplus places in order to achieve efficiency in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>298</span>
education, at the expense of denying parents any possibility of extra places in popular schools, we would just end up with an honest difference of opinion with the Audit Commission—what would be wrong with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the Government recognised in their circular that surplus places were occasionally appropriate, in response to demographic changes and to allow an element of choice in the system. We would all agree with that, but, assuming that local authorities have been acting in accordance with that guidance for the past two years—as I believe they have—does the Minister recognise that the provisions in the Bill constitute an additional element of surplus place creation? That is what we are concerned about. In reviewing the situation, the Audit Commission should take account not only of the circular, but of the potential effects of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall respond to the other points made by the hon. Member for Barking, having already covered the arguments about what information on consultation should be placed on the face of Bill. What emerged from the hon. Lady's argument was her continual desire to see decisions made at the level of local authorities, of the funding agency or even of the Secretary of State. That is intriguing, although rather predictable. As I have said repeatedly, we believe that most of those decisions are properly made at school level, after schools have properly consulted with those concerned—as I have said, that would usually be the LEA, the other schools affected, and the FAS where appropriate. That is common ground between us, but we place a bias in favour of schools, not the LEA, the FAS or even—dare I say it; I hope that my right hon. Friend will not read the report of our proceedings—the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady has, as ever, set out her stall and we have, as ever, listened, but I am not persuaded by her arguments. I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the Minister's response. I am happy to give way to him, as I did not want to reiterate the same old arguments; I attempted—perhaps not as clearly as I intended—to deal with the Minister's arguments against our opposing previous measures in the Bill. He says that the Bill should not contain specific provisions on consultation because they would be difficult to change. I agree, but that is precisely why it should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent years in particular, the Government have broken the trust between Ministers and the electorate. It should be a central and unchangeable tenet of this important Bill that certain bodies need to be consulted on some of its proposals. Until the Minister demonstrates that we can trust the Government to act sensibly and coherently, we must ensure that the Bill contains measures allowing for consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>299</span>
The Minister failed to respond to my argument that the Government's duty is not just to sponsor and facilitate the development of a few popular schools but to ensure that there is improvement in all schools for all our children so that we can tackle the long tail of underachievement. The constant failure to deal with not the issues that are important to the few, popular schools, but the key issues that would raise standards in the perhaps less popular and currently underachieving schools is the central difference between us and the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I did not pick up that important point in the hon. Lady's argument—perhaps it is so blindingly obvious. I would have thought that what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I have argued for some time about the curriculum, regular objective testing of pupils, the introduction of Ofsted and the Bill's provisions on the inspection of LEAs and on failing schools showed how we want to deal with standards. What my right hon. Friend is saying, probably as we speak, about the response to standards over time investigation, A-levels and GCSEs also illustrates that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bulk of the Bill's provisions—most of which we have yet to consider—is consonant with the hon. Lady's argument, and I see no way in which the measures that we are discussing are at odds with what she is saying. The Government have concentrated on standards—especially in those schools that are shown to be of lower standards generally—although not in the Bill's provisions that we have discussed so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister knows, there is agreement on some of the clauses that we shall discuss, especially those concerning the inspection of LEAs, for example, and other measures that we believe will raise standards. I am sure that the Minister heard the Secretary of State on the "Today" programme this morning, and there will be little disagreement on what needs to be done to maintain standards in A-levels. We can agree on that, and we would be delighted to support the rapid implementation of a Bill containing provisions on such matters rather than on increasing the number of grant-maintained schools or introducing selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have achieved something, but not enough. We know that, because of our relative position to competitor nations. British children are not more stupid than children in France, Italy or Germany, yet they are achieving less well at the age of 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intellectual argument has not been addressed by the Minister. Because clause 3 has been deleted, we are having to talk in this rather odd way; but enabling a grant-maintained school to increase its admissions by 50 per cent. will inevitably have an impact on neighbouring schools, if only because they will have less money. If they have less money, they will be less able to meet the requirements of the national curriculum, will not be able to offer a variety of sports and may not have a sixth form. All those aspects will be impeded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>300</span>
While benefiting a small number in one school, the Minister will disadvantage the many in neighbouring schools. Unless he answers what I believe to be an intellectually coherent proposition, which we have attempted to put forward in a variety of ways, he will lose the argument. We seem to be going over the same ground again. I am saddened by the Minister's inability to respond to what I believe is a strong argument. If he is not willing to withdraw clause 9, he leaves me with no option but to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we proceed, it might be appropriate for me to advise the Committee on the question of repetition, which has been raised several times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in the nature of a Bill such as this that the same arguments will apply to different clauses and amendments. In the process of selecting amendments, we can attempt to take account of that, as happened earlier this week with clauses 2 and 8. My presumption must be that hon. Members should have the opportunity, when moving amendments, to demonstrate that the same arguments apply again, even if it is repetitious. By the same token, the Minister is entitled to demonstrate that it is the same argument and he need not reply at length.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On occasions, of course, it is difficult to know whether members of the Committee are being repetitious until they have said what they have to say, by which time it is too late.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rely on the good sense of members of the Committee not to be tediously and unnecessarily repetitious. I hope that, with that guidance, we can proceed with the business of the Committee without unnecessary and excessive tedium.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move the amendment No. 150, in page 10, line 7, at end insert
	<br><q><p>'provided that before doing so it has had regard to such guidance as may have been issued by the Secretary of State'.</p></q>
I shall be extremely brief, Mr. O'Hara. The purpose of this amendment is slightly different; it is to ensure that governing bodies have regard to the guidance issued by the Secretary of State. In so doing, governing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>301</span>
bodies would consider factors brought to their attention before they proceeded to alter the admission number for an age group—they would have considered the effect of such a decision before taking and implementing it. That is again a common-sense proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would protect the interests of parents when seeking a place for their child at a school. Governing bodies must not be permitted to take decisions that may seriously alter and affect other schools as well as their own without first having been guided concerning what factors need to be considered. Those likely to be affected by such a decision need to be given early warning and to have proper opportunity to make their views known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not always obvious that a popular school should expand to meet parental demand. Indeed, many schools resist expansion on the ground of retaining the distinctive character of a smaller school. The Secretary of State's guidance to governing bodies should encourage them to consider the requirement for consultation and the costs involved, class size, organisation of the school, whether pupils will be poached from neighbouring schools, the impact on surplus places and any special educational needs implications. All those matters as a minimum should be considered in making such a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would provide some protection for governing bodies in the event of any legal action arising from their decision to increase admission numbers. Given the sort of legal cases that have been embarked on this week, we must be careful to ensure that increases in numbers do not have an impact on schools' quality that opens the floodgates to action by individual children or their parents. Governing bodies would at least be able to demonstrate that they had carefully considered the issue and followed guidance prior to making their decision. It is on that basis that I move the amendment, which is closely allied to the previous amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mrs. Cheryl Gillan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady said, the amendment is closely linked to the previous amendment, and I therefore do not want to incur your wrath, Mr. O'Hara, by repeating what my hon. Friend the Minister of State said in reply to that amendment. However, I shall briefly reply to the hon. Lady's points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady must appreciate that, at present, governors of schools in stage 1 areas must seek the Secretary of State's approval for an increase in approved admission numbers. Schools in stage 2 and 3 areas must go through a similar procedure for approval from the Funding Agency for Schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are no statutory requirements for procedures to be followed. Guidance in departmental circular 6/96 suggests that schools should consider whether it would be helpful to consult those affected by the proposed change before making an application, but a statutory obligation to consult before increasing an AAN is unnecessary. If an increase in an AAN
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>302</span>
arises from an enlargement of the premises, the governing body will have been under a duty to consult before that enlargement. In the unlikely event of governors deciding to increase the AAN—as opposed to the published admissions limit—without any enlargement of the premises, that increase is bound to be very small. Therefore it is with great sadness—although it will be no surprise to the hon. Lady—that I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point about repetition, I am not a wrathful man, but I have access to sanctions. I can restrict clause stand part debates if I feel that members of the Committee have been excessively repetitious when moving amendments.

	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was, of course, astounded that the Minister rejected our proposal. My astonishment spread at the display of unity among Conservative Members, which is a rare phenomenon these days. Having regard to your guidance, Mr. O'Hara, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 7 in page 10, line 42, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'(7) Unless determined by the Secretary of State to the contrary, no proposals under this section shall be permitted which increase the number of surplus places within any local authority area.'</p></q>
Bearing in mind your ruling on repetition and tedium, Mr. O'Hara, I hope that I shall not test your patience too far. I sense from our discussions today that there is a sensible way forward that the Committee might accept. I shall have to be a little repetitious by drawing attention to what the Minister of State said in our previous sitting. I refer to columns 208 to 212 of 	<i>Hansard.</i> We were debating the surplus places that currently exist, and the Minister of State confirmed that there are
	<br><q><p>"11 per cent. of primary places and 12 per cent. of secondary places unfilled."</p></q>
The Minister of State did not follow his own health warning and strayed from his brief. He responded—wisely or unwisely—to a question from the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) who asked what might be an appropriate excess percentage figure in the system. The Minister said:
	<br><q><p>"We have in mind, as a working figure, about 10 per cent. of places."</p></q>
He said that the percentage of unfilled places is 11 per cent. in primary schools and 12 per cent. in secondary schools, but that he believes that 10 per cent. would be an appropriate figure. Therefore, there must be some, albeit a modest, reduction in the number of surplus places. I asked the Minister who should be responsible for ensuring that there was a reduction. He replied:
	<br><q><p>"The ultimate authority for rationalisation is parental choice."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>303</span>
He was then challenged about the role of LEAs and we talked about different areas. When he was asked why there was a huge variation in the number of surplus places between one LEA and another, he said:
	<br><q><p>"The straightforward answer is that it depends on the competence of the local education authority. I do not particularly want to comment on the competence of individual authorities—unless pressed gently. However, it is self-evident that a number of authorities have been assiduous in trying to deal with excessive surplus places, which are an expensive educational overhead, whereas others—perhaps also owing to a natural underlying rapid growth in pupil numbers—have been able to reduce or even almost eliminate surplus places. It will depend on the underlying demographics of an area and on the assiduity with which the LEA pursues surplus places because it regards them as an expensive education overhead."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 3 December 1996; c. 208–12.]</p></q>
The Minister said that parental choice should be the vehicle for reducing surplus places, but he went on to say in the same debate that the local education authority should be responsible. That shows the confusion in the hon. Gentleman's mind and I want to give him a way out of the problem. Under the amendment, if there were a possibility of a proposal in clause 9 leading to an increase in surplus places, the Secretary of State would be the final arbiter of whether that proposal should go ahead. She would have an opportunity to consult widely before reaching her decision. The amendment is a helpful way forward for the Minister and I look forward to hearing his positive response to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am, as ever, touched by the hon. Gentleman's total faith in the Secretary of State's judgment. That I share that faith might be a turning point in our proceedings because we can move towards greater agreement. However, our views still differ a little. It may come as a surprise to him, but the Secretary of State and I share the view that the less the holder of her office is involved in such decisions, the better things will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know—at least, I think we do—that to push decision-making as near the affected community as possible used to be something in which the Liberal party said it believed; it is certainly something in which the Conservative party believes. Anyone who wants proof of that has only to consider the allocation of school budgets, local management of schools, the grant-maintained option and the other measures that we have put in place—which, by the way, were usually opposed by the hon. Gentleman's party—to give local people the power of decision-making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fairness, the hon. Gentleman has been consistent. He still wants the Secretary of State to make as many decisions as possible. That is a genuine difference between us, and so be it. I accept that surplus places can occur occasionally. It goes without saying, although I had better say it in case the hon. Gentleman wants to quote me to myself again in the future, that the 10 per cent., a national figure, would mask huge variations in different localities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I enjoyed the hon. Gentleman's speech as most of it consisted of my own words. Most politicians find nothing more pleasurable than to listen to their own words. This morning, I saw a colleague in the Tea Room doing what colleagues do so often—reading
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>304</span>
	<i>Hansard.</i> If we see colleagues doing that, the best bet is that they are reading their own speeches, not those of others. I can get a double whammy out of what has happened: by pretending to read the hon. Gentleman's speech, I will actually be reading my own words. Things are getting better and better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall outline the difference between the hon. Gentleman and myself. He wants to use the opportunity of an identified occurrence of surplus places in an area to preclude the possibility of the expansion of a popular local school to admit more pupils. We, in our circular, which I have oft quoted, and in the Bill, admit to a different possibility. We want to see the expansion of a local school even if that were to mean a temporary increase in the number of surplus places, according to the basic numbers in the formula and so on, on the assumption that a combination of the schools and the local authority, where appropriate, could deal subsequently with the surplus places. The amendment would put a straightjacket or corset on the system which would restrict the opportunity to increase the number of places in popular schools providing good education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During a previous sitting the Minister said that the cost to the system of a surplus place was about £800—I do not remember the exact figure or the column reference—but does he not accept that that is less than the cost of creating an additional place when capital expenditure is involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady because she has allowed me to make an apology in public—I shall also do so in writing. I am advised that the cost of a surplus place is in fact £200 and something. There was no intention to mislead, and I shall set out the position for the hon. Lady as soon as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger in trying to compare—although I understand why the hon. Lady is doing so—the advantages to be gained by doing away with surplus places on the one hand and the cost of providing additional places on the other. The figures are fraught with difficulties. Costs will depend as ever on the circumstances of either the reduction or the enhancement. For example, if a popular and expanding school had spare physical capacity, it could expand its pupil numbers at relatively little additional cost, whereas if a new teaching block had to be built to deal with expansion, the cost per place would increase considerably. Such calculations must come with that health warning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister might recall that he gave an additional commitment to meet the surplus place costs where new building is involved. Given that we are talking about the possibility of using private funding to expand or create grant-maintained schools and that the Government are talking about design, build and management contracts, which will presumably contain provisions for services as well as the building itself, will the Minister tell us the likely cost of creating a place under the private finance initiative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>305</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to do that for the hon. Gentleman. However, yesterday I had an interesting conversation with a representative of the Funding Agency for Schools during which an example was given of a school that occupies three different sites, each of which has a significant disposal value. I was told that that school wants to dispose—perhaps under a PFI arrangement—of some of their grounds and use the money raised to build an entirely new school either on a green-field site or on one of the other sites that it already owns. Even as I give that example, the complications that might arise can be seen, as I think the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) will readily understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Variations in circumstances make it difficult to put a notional figure on the disposal of a surplus place or the creation of the new place. In the end, it comes down to the fact that such matters can be considered only case by case. We all know from our dealings with local education authorities and our experience of the differing circumstances of schools that such costings are fragile, to say the least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the answer to the point made by the hon. Member for Attercliffe about the apparent contradiction between dealing with surplus places on one hand and the provision of new places on the other. For all those reasons, I think that the amendment is even more restrictive and heavy handed than some of the others that we have debated, and I ask the Committee to reject it. I shall try to do my best to honour quickly the commitments that I have given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister rightly said that such matters need to be considered case by case. However, only a few minutes ago he told us that he was in favour of local people having the power to make decisions. I entirely agree with his desire to push decision-making down to community level, but we are dealing with grant-maintained schools that are outwith the purview of local community decision-making, so we must move amendments, such as this, which are contrary in some senses to the views that many of us hold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not dealt with the conflict inherent in his earlier remarks on how to reduce surplus places. On the one hand, he said that it could be done through parental choice; and on the other hand that it would be done by the local education authority. In my view, the LEA is the right place for the local community to make its decision; but clause 9 does not allow a local education authority to decide whether expansion in a particular school should be allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not my preferred route—as you know, Mr. O'Hara, I would prefer to see the end of grant-maintained status—but as it still exists, I am seeking to help the Minister over the difficulty caused by the contradiction in his earlier remarks. Given that the amendment has not found favour, I might try to find another way to help the Minister out of his difficulty. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment seeks to give the Government the opportunity to demonstrate how they intend to use clause 11 to prevent decisions by single-sex schools from conflicting with the duties placed on local

education authorities and the Funding Agency for Schools under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. The need for clause 11 results from the Government's wish to avoid that conflict with section 25 of the 1975 Act, which places a general duty on the public sector of education not to discriminate on grounds of gender. My son's school has been thwarted in its ambitions to become selective on those grounds, because the same number of places are not available for young women in the local authority area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The section was considered in the case Regina 	<i>v.</i> Birmingham city council ex parte the Equal Opportunities Commission, which was heard on 14 October 1992, and it was discussed during the passage of the Education Act 1993. The case arose because of an imbalance in the number of girls' and boys' grammar school places in the Birmingham area. The city council was found not to be discharging its duty to provide sufficient secondary school places, as girls had to achieve a higher standard to receive a grammar school place. It is important to put on the record the court's findings. The court said:
	<br><q><p>"It is noteworthy in the important paper entitled 'Choice and Diversity: A New Framework for Schools', which was presented to Paliament by the Secretary of State for England and Wales in July 1992, that no reference was made to the requirements of the Sex Discrimination Act. This Act, and comparable legislation in the field of race relations, requires close examination when the duties and obligations of bodies responsible for the provision of public sector education are being formulated.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>It seems to us that if and when further legislation in the field of education is being considered"—</p></q>
as it is today—
	<br><q><p>"it is important that account be taken of:
	<ol>
	<li>the fact that both the Secretary of State and local education authorities retain under the present legislation some overall responsibilities for public sector education as a whole;</li>
	<li>the fact that the discrimination with which a court would be likely to be primarily concerned would be discrimination against an individual boy or girl or groups of boys or girls.</li>
</ol></p></q>
	<br><q><p>In these circumstances we consider that amendments should be introduced to enable the elimination of discrimination to take place in accordance with a suitable and a sensible timescale. Schools or school places cannot be provided at the drop of a hat. Furthermore, account must be taken of the fact that the risks of discrimination may vary from year to year or even from term to term. Even if precisely equal numbers of places are provided at particular types of school both for boys and girls, girls may be required to achieve a higher mark to obtain admission. Under the present legislation, this might constitute a form of unlawful discrimination. But the disparities will be likely to vary from year to year and be due to factors over which local education authorities or governing bodies could not possibly exercise control. It may therefore be right to provide that unlawful discrimination could only be proved if over a period a pattern of discrimination could be established."</p></q>
It is important to take that on board—as, I hope, the Government have. We hope that, during the debate on the amendment, the Under-Secretary of State will explain how the Government intend to apply the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that everyone will agree with the clause, as it safeguards the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. The hon. Gentleman will not find much difference between us, as he clearly recognises the need for the safeguards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>308</span>
Clause 11 serves an important, if limited, purpose. The Sex Discrimination Act requires LEAs, the FAS and the Further Education Funding Council to carry out their responsibilities for providing sufficient places without sex discrimination. That has been interpreted as a requirement to secure comparable provision for both sexes if there is a demand. The Act, as it applies to education, has not changed since 1975, and we do not propose to change it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A change to one single-sex school—adding a sixth form, for example—can trigger a requirement for balancing provision for the opposite sex.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am of course aware that if the Bill is enacted, it will deal with such instances of discrimination. What is the Government's intention with regard to existing discrimination?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the hon. Gentleman means. Can he give instances of existing discrimination? He mentioned Bluecoats school, which his son attends. I understand that its governors have said that if there were a demand for it to take girls, and for girls' selective places in Liverpool, they would seriously consider publishing proposals to make the school co-educational. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware of that, as I know he takes a close interest in all matters pertaining to that school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In examining statutory proposals for significant changes to single-sex schools, the Secretary of State considers any Sex Discrimination Act implications. If she decides that the change would require balancing provision that the LEA, the FAS or the FEFC would find difficult or impossible to secure, she can reject the proposal. The Bill will not change that in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill gives schools greater scope to make changes without statutory proposals. Some changes that will not require statutory proposals might nevertheless trigger a requirement for balancing provision that the LEA, the FAS or the FEFC might find difficult to make. The clause is therefore necessary to enable the Secretary of State to set up a screening mechanism, if needed, to prevent that happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, hon. Members should bear in mind that the number of single-sex schools is small: there are around 400 in England. Almost all are secondary, a quarter are 100 per cent. selective, and a high proportion have sixth forms. In other words, the potential for the changes that the Bill deregulates is small. It is by no means clear that the changes that could be made—for example, a non-selective single sex school introducing a limited measure of selection—would trigger demand for balancing provision. That means that, although we think the regulations that the clause enables the Secretary of State to make will probably be required to deal with the odd case, we cannot be sure of that. That is reason enough for not turning the Secretary of State's power to make regulations into a requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a more general reason for not doing so. One of the main purposes of regulations is to provide greater flexibility to deal with changing circumstances that detailed controls in primary legislation would allow; Secretaries of State are therefore almost always
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0269">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>309</span>
given a power rather than a duty to make regulations. I see no reason to depart from that principle in this case. I therefore recommend that the amendment be rejected if the hon. Gentleman presses it to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>SECRETARY OF STATE'S RESERVE POWER TO LIMIT APPROPRIATE THRESHOLD</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 100, in page 13, line 11, at end add—
	<br><q><p>'(6) It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to have regard for the purpose of exercising his powers under this section, to the admissions arrangements applicable to maintained schools throughout England and Wales and to the availability of places in such schools.'</p></q>
This is a probing amendment. The clause seems to suggest that the Government have doubts about what they are doing in the Bill; the clause gives the Secretary of State reserve powers to limit the appropriate threshold in any area that the Secretary of State specifies. It is also clear that that threshold might not be limited to just one local authority area; it will not necessarily be coterminous with the LEA and could consist of a wider area. When the Bill was being compiled in the Department for Education and Employment—and, I hope, in the Welsh Office, which I would hate to think of as just being dragged along by the nose, although we should perhpas not go into that now—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that the Welsh Office was involved in the preparation of the Bill and is fully aware of what is contained in it. I hope that that will give the hon. Gentleman a great deal of comfort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Welsh Office has been involved, although I am of course astounded that anybody in that office could have given any credence to the provisions of the Bill—or at least to those of chapter I.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, in England, and the Secretary of State for Wales, in Wales, should take admissions policies into account when giving effect to the provisions of the clause—which, as I said, may extend beyond one local authority area. If the Secretary of State feels the need to look beyond the bounds of any one local education authority to consider what is happening in other authority areas, he should have an eye on the picture for the whole of England, or the whole of Wales. Otherwise there could be fragmentation and division. That is why we should write into the Bill a direction
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>310</span>
that the Secretary of State should bear in mind, and take account of, admission policies of LEAs across England or Wales before activating the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, this is a probing amendment to discover the Government's fears and second thoughts—or maybe their 102nd thoughts—about introducing all the extensions to thresholds for specialisation or selection in schools in the grant-maintained or maintained sectors. I look foward with eager anticipation to what the Minister has to say about the Government's fears about all the other provisions of chapter I.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the comfort of saying that the Government have any fears or trepidations about what we propose in the Bill. We are 101 per cent. behind every clause of the Bill. But I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be comforted by my words; I have treated the amendment as a probing amendment, because it was hard to fathom from its drafting exactly what the hon. Gentleman was trying to get at. I presumed that he wanted a fuller discussion of the clause, and I will try to satisfy him by taking him through some of its aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, the clause will enable the Secretary of State to make regulations that allow her to designate by order areas in which the threshold for all schools introducing or extending selection on the basis of high ability or aptitude would be 20 per cent. Provisions elsewhere in the Bill that will allow specialist and grant-maintained schools to select up to 30 per cent. and 50 per cent. respectively will not apply here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The criteria that the Secretary of State will take into account when considering whether to designate an area will be set out in regulations. We see little advantage in specifying those criteria in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciated that much of this work was to be done by regulation, but I wondered whether the Minister might tell us whether she considers it appropriate that LEA admission policies be considered before decisions provided for in the clause are made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me help the hon. Gentleman a little later, when I have given some thought to what he has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prime responsibility for ensuring that there are sufficient school places rests with LEAs and the Funding Agency for Schools, and we expect that the reserve power would be used only after consultation with those bodies—and probably in response to representations made by them to the Secretary of State. That should go some way towards allaying the hon. Gentleman's fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no intention of penalising popular schools. If a parent wants to apply for a selective school place outside his LEA area, he should be able to make that choice. Less popular schools will have to rise to the challenge of competition to attract applicants, but we do not envisage having to use the power often, if at all.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>311</span>
Experience suggests that admission authorities cooperate sensibly so that pupils are not left without school places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Member for Bridgend knows what I am getting at, so I shall keep my answer short. We shall be taking stock around April next year to see whether regulations are necessary. I hope having heard my response, albeit a brief one, that the hon. Gentleman is fully satisfied that it is a sensible precaution to include in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for her reply and hope that my political career will not be damaged by saying that I accept her assurances. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause recognises the problems that may arise if schools extend selection without central or, indeed, local approval. We are concerned—my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend has already made the point—that allowing schools to introduce or extend selection of up to 20 per cent. of their intake could have a significant impact in many areas. We believe that the 20 per cent. limit is insufficient to counter many of the difficulties that may arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two simple questions for the Minister, to which I hope she can give a brief reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A good reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without doubt. My questions are very simple. Why do the Government believe that the figure of 20 per cent. is sufficient to address the problems that have been identified in the White Paper? What are the circumstances that will be prescribed in regulations? Will they define, for example, how great a shortage of school places triggers designation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the hon. Gentleman to what I said at the start of the clause stand part debate. On his point about the 20 per cent. limit, we believe that it is a reasonable figure. One of the joys of being in government is the ability to make such decisions. It is a reasonable figure, which after all is only permissive. Schools do not have to select at all, nor do they have to select up to the level of 20 per cent. We are merely allowing them to do so if they so wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister a little further? Will she tell us why 20 per cent. was the chosen figure? Is it purely arbitrary or is there a rational explanation for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Until inspiration arrives, I think that the hon. Gentleman should rely entirely on what I have said. In reply to the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) earlier, I reiterated that schools can already select up to 15 per cent. of their intake without statutory proposals. Therefore the margin is only 5 per cent., which is small and one that we consider to be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>312</span>
appropriate, as it is permissive. I shall not engage in discussion with the hon. Gentleman about the 5 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry: the question stands. Why not 25, 30 or 45 per cent? It is not good enough for the Minister to say that there is nothing to argue about simply because the difference is marginal. Why was the figure of 20 per cent. chosen? It is a very simply question to which I should have thought there was a simple answer. If the Minsiter or a civil servant has just plucked it out of the air, she should say so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a very simple answer. We think that to allow schools to select up to 20 per cent. of their intake without having to publish statutory proposals is sensible. It is the Government's policy to allow choice and diversity. There is no compulsion; it is a permissive measure allowing schools to choose. I know that the hon. Member for Walton does not like the thought of schools choosing to do things without having to come back into the central, bureaucratic government control, but the Conservative party believes that such freedom is necessary and we have chosen the figure of 20 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how much more the hon. Member for Walton wants to pursue this matter, but I want to move that the clause stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is for the Chairman to move the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My apologies, Mr. O'Hara.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it is a reserve power, the Government do not anticipate using it in the immediate future but, if it is ever needed, it is right to include it in the Bill to ensure that the statutory framework is watertight. I am sure that the hon. Member for Walton would agree with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want only simple explanations to simple questions, but we have had no satisfaction from the Minister, yet again. She still cannot explain where the figure of 20 per cent. comes from.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obviously reasonable—as the hon. Member for Bath says. He is accusing the Minister of being reasonable, which is not something that I would do very often.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his inimitable style, the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth has again made a spurious intervention. It is the Government's legislation, not ours.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was kind enough to ask why not 19 or 21 per cent? We have given him the figure in the middle—20 per cent. That is clearly the answer that he wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>'()—Schools which admit a proportion of pupils by reference to ability or aptitude, and also within their admission arrangements accord priority to the siblings of pupils or former pupils, shall not accord any such priority to siblings of pupils or former pupils who were admitted by reference to their ability or aptitude.'.—[	<i>Mr. Don Foster.</i>]</p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the benefit of the Committee I intend to be brief. I know that that may upset the Minister of State, who was hoping that I might take a little more time. No doubt, Mr. O'Hara, you at least will be pleased. To make it even easier, I will follow the Minister of State's example and merely quickly read the brief that I have here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause concerns the selection of siblings. Partial selection by ability or aptitude will—as we have argued several times—reduce access to schools for local pupils who are unable to meet the selection criteria, while more distant pupils who meet the criteria will be admitted. If, in subsequent years, the siblings of more distant pupils were given priority over local pupils with no sibling connection, schools would become incrementally less accessible to local pupils—it says here. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Joking aside, this is a serious point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, let us say that a school with an intake of 150 pupils decides to admit 30 per cent. of them—45 pupils—by ability. I am sure that anybody with even basic mathematics can work out that that would mean that there would be 105 non-selective places for local pupils in year one of the arrangement. In year two, 45 pupils would again be selected, but there might

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>315</span>
be, say, 10 siblings of the 45 pupils who were selected in year one, which would leave only 95 non-selective places for local pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In year three, 45 pupils would again be selected, and let us say that by then there are 25 siblings of the 90 pupils selected in years one and two—plus the 10 siblings from year two. That would mean that there would then be only 80 non-selective places for local pupils. So the process would continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that if we allow the sibling rule to continue, so that siblings of selected children who come from a long way away are accepted, without increasing selection beyond the initial 30 per cent. we will gradually reduce the number of non-selective places for local pupils. That is a crucial flaw in the partially selective arrangements, which has the potential to create substantial political fall-out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If siblings of selected pupils are given priority, local parents will become increasingly angry because they will be denied access to their local school. If siblings of selected pupils are not given priority, their parents will be angered by having their familiteis split—one of the complaints that helped to bring down the fully selective system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, given that clear example of the progressive difficulty that will occur if the sibling rule continues to be part of selection arrangements alongside the Government's proposals, the new clause will be included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The clause would divide families down the middle; it would part sisters and brothers just because the eldest happened to be a bright child. I am absolutely amazed that the hon.

If siblings are split up, parents may have to drive several miles from one school to another, especially in a rural area, to drop off their children, and that puts pressure on the family. Which school should parents choose? As the hon. Member for Bath rightly said, the new arrangements will inflict the problem again—it is 50 per cent. of one or 50 per cent. of the other. At present, parents choose a local school in their community; they may not have the transport facilities to take their children elsewhere. If, however, they decide to send their child to a selective school, they should incur any consequent inconvenience—that inconvenience should not be imposed on parents who already send their children to the local school.

I do not believe that he has read the new clause, as he clearly does not understand it. It would divide brother and sister, sister and sister, brother and brother. It would disadvantage local children who are unable to gain a place under the selectivity criterion but whose sibling previously had. Although they lived locally, the could not call upon the sibling connection as other local children could. Do the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just accused the hon.

In areas where parents do not want to return to selection, their schools having gone comprehensive, one of the reasons they most commonly give is that they fear their children will be split up and have to go to different schools.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause allows the FAS to establish new grant-maintained schools and to relax the requirement—which we opposed—of the Education Act 1993 that the FAS can do so only when it had gained responsibility for 10 per cent. of grant-maintained schools in the area. Many members of the Committee were present at the Committee stage of the 1993 Act. My recollection of that legislation was that it required the FAS to establish an interest and demonstrate that it had some support in the locality before it could open new schools. No reason for the relaxation of that requirement has been given in the Bill, or in speeches made by the Minister of State and his hon. Friends. In three short years, a requirement that was thought to be necessary has been relaxed without proper explanation or justification. In fact, the only possible explanation is that grant-maintained schools are no longer popular, only a few more than 1,000 schools deciding to become grant-maintained. Having failed to raise a vote for grant-maintained schools, the Government want to give the Funding Agency for Schools the right to open new grant-maintained schools without considering the feelings of local people. The notion used to be that parents should have the opportunity to choose whether to opt for a grant-maintained school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been made of the fact that under the Bill—a permissive Bill—it would be up to local people and schools to decide. It is quite clear that local parents and schools have spoken. They have decided that they do not want schools in their areas to have grant-maintained status, yet the Bill gives a distant body, the FAS, the ability and power to open new schools, regardless of whether local people want them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

short years. In fact, the clause amends the 1996 Act. As you can see, Mr. O'Hara, my hands are inky because, after only a few short months, the ink is hardly dry on that statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that correction. Debating various Bills year after year is so pleasurable that they merge in one's mind. Those three years seemed short because, as my hon. Friend said, the Act was only one of many. He has made a close study of the parts of the Bill that correct the 1996 Act, and he was right to draw my attention to the fact that it is that Act that is now being changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should explain why such a recent provision is seemingly no longer required. The amendment would require the FAS to show the need for an extra school before granting permission. In circular 23/94, the Government outlined the principal factors that the Secretary of State should take into account when considering whether to accept proposals for a new school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill mentions choice and diversity as reasons for the FAS deciding to open a new school, but I am sure that no member of the Committee would want a new school to be opened if it made the problem of surplus places worse. We have agreed that valuable resources are used on surplus places that could be used in existing schools or for school buildings. The amendment would require the FAS to show a need for a school before a new one was opened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not all members of the Committee would accept what the hon. Lady said. I have said until I am almost tired of hearing myself, which is pretty difficult, that we admit the possibility of a temporary increase in the number of what would be strictly defined as surplus places in order to improve the provision in popular and oversubscribed schools in an area. The hon. Lady made a bald statement, hoping that I would not quite pick it up, but she is not correct. We would not all agree with her proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's clarification. I find it difficult to accept that he should refuse an amendment that would merely require the FAS to investigate the need for a new school and require it to publish an analysis of that need. Surely the Minister is not saying that people who want to set up a school with public money ought not to find out whether there is a need for a school in that area? We are talking about public money, which is in short supply. If the money is spent on opening a new school that is not needed, it is denied to other schools in the area that may need it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is clear. It does not seek to stop the FAS opening new grant-maintained schools; it is not a wrecking amendment. The Bill puts the onus on the FAS to consider choice and diversity when it is thinking of opening a new school. The amendment merely adds to that requirement that it should investigate whether there is a genuine need for a school and publish an analysis of that need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such action is a responsible way for the funding authority to proceed if it is proposing to spend public money. Local authorities do that if they want to open
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>320</span>
a new school. It would be completely irresponsible if local education authorities were allowed to open new schools just to meet the need for choice and diversity, without paying any regard to the analysis of need in the area. Proper planning at the local stage is crucial to ensure proper expenditure of public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed to be saying that he is happy for public money to be spent on opening a new school merely to satisfy choice and diversity, whether or not the need for such a school had been established. I am happy to give way again to him if he wants to confirm that that is what he said, because that is how we understood his response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to remove from the clause the right of the FAS to open new schools to meet the need for choice and diversity. That is not the path we want to take. We want to put into the clause the requirement for the funding authority to examine whether there is a genuine need for the school and to publish an analysis of that need. Our proposal is not a wrecking amendment; it would ensure that the limited amount of money available for expenditure on capital buildings—there will be consequent revenue implications—is spent only when an analysis of the need has been published and when the need for a new school in an area can be proved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not dwell too long on the matter of surplus places, as I know that you do not want us to be repetitive, Mr. O'Hara. But it would be ridiculous if schools were opened, without an analysis of the need for them having been taken into account, and we exacerbated the problem of surplus places. The amendment merely requires the FAS to behave as local education authorities currently behave. It would create a level playing field for the two providers and the two planners of places within a local authority area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In her excellent exposition, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris) made the case for amendments Nos. 152 and 153, and I now want to say a few words about amendment No. 130. It would ensure that the Funding Agency for Schools uses its capital funds well when planning to open new schools and that it formulates its proposals
	<br><q><p>"without providing for any grant-maintained school to have more places for pupils than it may reasonably be expected are capable of being filled."</p></q>
It is obvious that the clause should be amended to include such a provision. It would ensure that there was a demand and a need for more places before the money was spent. Evidence put before the Select Committee on Education and Employment demonstrated that capital spending by the Funding Agency for Schools in grant-maintained schools was about two and a half to three times the amount per pupil spent in county and LEA schools. That shows that the grant-maintained sector it already attracting substantially more capital funds than the LEA sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If £1 is spent on a school that did not need it, because no need for places had been demonstrated, that £1 could not be spent elsewhere. As a result of that, other schools that desperately need new building programmes would lose out. My hon. Friend the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>321</span>
Member for Barking mentioned the £3 billion to £4 billion backlog in capital spending in schools. But other grant-maintained schools that are expecting building programmes could lose out because of the provision of unnecessary places from the capital fund of the Funding Agency for Schools. I should like to hear from the Minister where the capital funds that the FAS will use will come from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also clarify for the Committee precisely what will be the difference between the Funding Agency for Schools' making an application to increase places and an LEA doing likewise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No difference—that is the answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope so.
Section 35(3) of the Education Act 1996, which pertains to the establishment and alteration of county and voluntary schools, states:
	<br><q><p>"Proposals published under this section shall include particulars…</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(b) of the number of pupils intended to be admitted to the school in each relevant age group in the first school year in relation to which the proposals have been wholly implemented."</p></q>
When summing up, will the Minister confirm, first, whether under current legislation the Funding Agency for Schools is obliged to state the number of pupils likely to be in the school and, secondly, what difference the Bill will make to those arrangements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What will be the effect on communities of the generation or creation of extra places? There are only six comprehensive schools in my constituency, but if a seventh school—a grant-maintained school—were to be established, it would not just create what are glibly called surplus places but would affect the strategic development of every school. The students who filled that school would have to come from existing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have here a letter from a school; I am sure that we have all be inundated with mail from schools and colleges. The school is not in my constituency; I do not expect to gain any votes by mentioning it. It draws my attention—I hope that I can draw this to the Minister's attention—to the effect that the provisions would have on that school. Because at present the school is only just running a viable sixth form offering A-level Latin, electronics, music and physics, a reduction in its total numbers would threaten those A-level courses. Rather than choice being widened, choice would be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not considered the effect on the provision of choice and diversity in individual areas of allowing grant-maintained schools to be set up with no regard to existing provision. That will cause difficulties for Schools, reduce choice and show that we are more interested in educational dogma than in the education of our children. In the long term, that will be a bad move all round.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>322</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members are making terribly heavy weather of all this. They seem to assume that somehow the Funding Agency for Schools would be able to fudge a proposal for a new school to the Secretary of State without telling her anything. That stretches my credulity; I would have thought that it would have stretched the credulity of Opposition Members. As the hon. Member for Devonport asked a straightforward question, I shall give him a straightforward answer. I refer him to page 339 of the Education Act 1996 and to schedule 20, which concerns proposals for the establishment of new grant-maintained schools, and which states:
	<br><q><p>"The proposals shall describe the arrangements it is proposed to adopt in respect of the admission of pupils to the school and, in particular, shall specify the number of pupils proposed to be admitted to the school in each relevant age group in the first school year beginning on or after the date of implementation of the proposals and, if pupils are proposed to be admitted for nursery education, give the prescribed information."</p></q>
In other words, the provisions are even more detailed than those which the hon. Gentleman sought to elicit. That would have to be so, would it not? Surely none of us could imagine circumstances in which the funding agency—a publicly funded and accountable body—would make a case for a grant-maintained school without having an analysis of need, specifying the number of pupils and detailing the nature of the school and its relationship with educational provision its immediate area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Member seem to imagine that the funding agency is a secret organisation, which has unlimited sums of public money, operates clandestinely and randomly sets up schools around the country. I have seen no evidence of that happening. In fact, evidence shows that the Funding Agency for Schools is not only responsible and cautious but rather careful about the approach it takes to setting up new schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister recalls the article in 	<i>The Independent</i> that suggests that the Funding Agency for Schools is interested in taking over the funding of all schools—it is anxious to spread its tentacles. I am concerned that the funding agency can simply set up a grant-maintained school whenever it likes. I need to be convinced that the Government will not consider setting up grant-maintained schools in areas, such as Leeds, where they are rare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are only two grant-maintained schools in Leeds because the schools there have found working with the local authority to be a positive experience. They do not want to change their status. I am concerned that the Government will encourage the funding agency to set up grant-maintained schools willy nilly in areas where there is no grant-maintained school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can reassure the hon. Genetleman in several ways. First, the statutory obligations of the funding agency are set out clearly in the Education Act 1996, as amended by the Bill. Secondly, the funding agency operates independently of the Department. It is not the practice for Ministers to be allowed to intervene in the operational activities
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>323</span>
of a non-departmental public body or agency, such as the Funding Agency for Schools; nor will they be allowed to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the funding agency and Departments—through their permanent secretaries as accounting officers—are fully accountable to the House, the Public Accounts Committee, the National Audit Office, and the Audit Commission, as the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South knows better than most; so it is inconceivable that the Government or the funding agency can wander around the country willy nilly—to use the hon. Gentleman's term—setting up grant-maintained schools gratuitously because that is what the Government wanted. I promise the hon Member for Morley and Leeds, South that that is not how it works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my colleagues might like that idea; they might well think that the future lies with the grant-maintained sector. I freely confess that they would love to see grant-maintained schools scattered liberally across the country. Given the processes that I have described, that is—I think that I can fairly use the word—impossible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I am becoming increasingly confused. Can the Minister confirm that the Funding Agency for Schools has the power to establish grant-maintained schools anywhere? Can he also confirm that the FAS operates independently, as he has just said? If the answer to both questions is yes, to whom can anyone object to oppose the establishment of a grant-maintained school? Who can stop it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am so glad that the hon. Gentleman asked that question. I can now redeem myself in the eyes of the Committee and, I am happy to say, of the Secretary of State, because the answer to the question is: the Secretary of State, no less. I have been looking for an opportunity to mention her positively, as I have said the odd thing that could have been misconstrued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The funding agency will have to make proper proposals, which will be referred to the Secretary of State. The proposals will have to contain all the material about which Opposition Members are understandably concerned, as it is inconceivable that any Secretary of State would give house room to proposals for a new grant-maintained school unless they included the analyses, information, and all other items that the amendments would require, and more. Although I understand the motivation behind the amendment, it is entirely otiose and I ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At least the Minister seems to agree with what we are saying; he just does not want the words to be included in the Bill. He should understand our suspicions about the Government's intentions to increase the number of grant-maintained schools.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>324</span>
I do not want to use unparliamentary language, Mr. O'Hara, and I am sure that you would guide me if I did, but I am not sure that I think that the Minister's words are helpful—I cannot say honest. The Minister is a member of a Government that would use any form of legislation to increase the number of grant-maintained schools. As he has just said, many members of his party would like the Funding Agency for Schools to be able to establish grant-maintained schools willy nilly throughout the country. It is crucial that the Bill ensure that it cannot do that without an analysis of need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister said in Birmingham in September that he would take action to increase the number of grant-maintained schools throughout the country. I believed the Bill to be a response to what the Minister's leader said, and part II will give the FAS a new power to set up grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is not necessary to specify in the Bill the requirement for the FAS to consider whether a school is needed on the grounds of numbers, why is it necessary to specify that it
	<br><q><p>"shall have regard to the desirability of increasing diversity and opportunities for choice in education"?</p></q>
If, as the Minister says, the Bill need not include certain details because the Secretary of State will take all such matters into account, why should the requirement to have regard to
	<br><q><p>"diversity and opportunities for choice"</p></q>
be included and not the requirement for the FAS to work out whether there is a need for places in the local authority area?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment concerns fairness as between the local authority and the FAS. It would mean that they are both governed by the same set of rules, so that we could ensure that public money is spent where it should be spent and where it is needed. It is essential that, in deciding whether to apply to open a new grant-maintained school, the FAS should provide analyses of and data on whether there is a need. Everyone—even the Minister—would agree that that is proper. Let us give that requirement the same priority as the requirement to
	<br><q><p>"have regard to the desirability of increasing diversity and opportunities for choice".</p></q>
The amendment is important, as it concerns whether public money is spent properly. It would ensure that the little capital that is available in the education system is spent in the interest of all our children and not merely to satisfy the political aims of some Committee members. I press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 142, in page 13, line 43, leave out 'such persons' and insert—
	<br><q><p>'(a) relevant local education authorities, and</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(b) the governing bodies of any existing grant-maintained schools appearing to be affected by the proposals, and such other persons.'.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 73, in page 13, line 44, after 'appropriate', insert—
	<br><q><p>'including the LEA or LEAs in the area and the governing bodies of the maintained schools in the area.'.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that in his reply the Minister will spend a moment or two clarifying the distinction between the words "propose" and "establish". Clause 14 provides that
	<br><q><p>"The funding authority may establish a grant-maintained school."</p></q>
However, the explanatory memorandum states that the funding authority "may propose". There is clearly a significant difference between the two. That goes back to what the Minister said earlier about the Secretary of State's ability to reject a proposal. The point needs to be clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had several debates about who should be consulted in particular circumstances. The amendment is on similar lines. In previous debates, the Minister said that he thought it unnecessary to write into the Bill various groups or individuals because they would be clearly covered in the guidance issued to the funding authority. As this is a separate issue, and as the guidance will doubtless be different, it would help if the Minister told the Committee about the nature of the guidance that is likely to be proposed, to see whether it is necessary to include those words in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Funding Agency for Schools will be required to consult those who might be affected by a new school and to have regard to guidance from the Secretary of State. As we have repeatedly made clear, we shall consult on the details of the guidance on consultation to be issued by the Department. That will include guidance given to the FAS on proposals for new schools. As I have said many times before, it would be wrong to anticipate exactly what such guidance might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>326</span>
However, section 211 of the Education Act 1996, which clause 14 seeks to replace, also requires the FAS to have regard to guidance before publishing proposals for a new grant-maintained school. That guidance is provided by circular 23/94 on the supply of school places. Paragraph 69 of the circular lists those whom the Secretary of State would expect to be consulted by a body planning to publish statutory proposals. The list includes any local education authority likely to be affected by the proposals and the governing body of any LEA school or grant-maintained school that may be affected. I would therefore be surprised if the guidance associated with the new section 211 did not set out similar expectations. The amendments are therefore unnecessary and can safely be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave us a good idea of what may be contained in the guidance. However, I am disappointed that he has not responded to my opening request for clarification of the distinction between the word "establish" in the Bill and the word "propose".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is any confusion. We are saying that there have to be proposals before a school can be established. If I remember rightly, the clause heading refers to "Establishment" and then goes on to describe the procedures for proposals. One cannot establish a school before making proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear about the problem, but it may be safer to write to the hon. Member for Bath to clarify it, lest I have misunderstood his confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is right that it is a matter for clarification. I do not distrust any of his earlier answers, but just so that it is clearly on the record, I should say that I am concerned that we are back to a problem that we had before, when the wording in an earlier Bill said that the funding authority "may establish" a grant-maintained school. The Minister said that the funding authority will operate independently of the Department, but there is continuing concern that the wording implies that the authority could go ahead and establish the school without the consent of the Secretary of State. The Minister will acknowledge that there is nothing in the Bill saying that the authority needs the Secretary of State's approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that that is a matter that can be clarified in correspondence. Meanwhile, given the Minister's helpful response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. There seemed to be a little confusion during the last Division. I should explain that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Lady Olga Maitland) had her head under the table and was saying, "Hello, hello, hello", and we were a little concerned for her wellbeing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
