	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Simon Burns)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Special Grant Report (No. 27) (Community Care Special Grants for 1997–98) (House of Commons Paper No. 360).</p></blockquote>
The special grant report gives the amount of special transitional grant for each English local authority for 1997–98. The total amount of the grant is £325 million. The special transitional grants for each of the years 1993–94 to 1996–97 have now been included in the standard spending assessment for personal social services, together with the increase in capital limits grant which we introduced last year. The total funding that we are giving to local authorities in England in 1997–98 for their new responsibilities under the community care reforms is therefore £2.6 billion, which is a very substantial sum indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the full picture of the resources that the Government provide to local authorities must also include the historic community care resources. The total provision for community care in England has risen from £2.3 billion in 1990 to more than £5.9 billion in 1997, which is more than a doubling of resources in real terms. The total funding for all social services is £7.8 billion, which represents a massive resource for any one Government service. It remains for local authorities to decide how much of their general funding they actually spend on community care. That level of funding shows the substantial commitment we have made to giving local authorities the resources to enable them to meet the needs of their local communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In deciding to continue with a special transitional grant in 1997 I was aware of the representations which many care-home owners have made from around the country, which show that they have little confidence in some local authorities' willingness to choose the independent sector's good-quality and cost-effective services in preference to their own more expensive in-house provision. I believe that there is still further scope for the development of a flourishing independent care sector in both the residential and domiciliary care markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason we are again attaching two conditions to the special grant. The first requires local authorities to spend it on community care services. The second requires local authorities to spend 85 per cent of the grant in the independent sector, otherwise known as the 85 per cent condition. To ensure that that
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
is being satisfied by additional expenditure in the independent sector, there is a cumulative element to the condition. Each year, local authorities must show that their community care expenditure in the independent sector in that year is in addition to the amounts required to meet the condition for the past years. In 1997 the cumulative effect will be applied to the past three years. Local authorities can satisfy the condition by spending a total of more than £1.6 billion in the independent sector in 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities should treat their services in a similar fashion to independent sector services through the use of sevice agreements and contracts within a mature contracting framework. Local authorities should use their budgets to purchase community care services to meet the needs of their local communities irrespective of sector and not their historic budgetary arrangements. They need to see their role more in terms of being commissioners rather than providers of those services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also compared costs of in-house and private provision. The average cost to a prospective resident of an in-house placement in an English local authority in 1994–95 was £283 and an independent sector place purchased by them averages around £246. That difference provides the scope for substantial savings by some local authorities. When the comparison of quality is the same, and the independent sector is often better, people who are self funding will choose their residential care home taking cost as a main factor. Local authorities need to make a similar judgment between providing in-house services at a higher cost and purchasing good-quality care at a lower cost from the independent sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many local authorities could achieve further significant savings for their communities if they also made fuller use of independent sector domiciliary services. Currently, they are used only as a stop gap to provide the flexibility of services that local authorities cannot deliver in-house. If the independent sector can achieve savings for local authorities in difficult cases, how much more could be saved by allowing the independent sector to compete for more of the core service provision?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it comes to the question of value for money, local authorities often need to bring their costs down. They need to consider carefully the justification for spending more on directly provided services than an equivalent service that is provided by the independent sector. The difference in costs when multiplied by the numbers of users presents some authorities with the opportunity to make considerable savings in their present budgets. Those savings could be utilised to improve and to extend the community care services that they offer to their local communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To help them, we recently published a report entitled "Better Value for money in Social Services: A Review of Performance Trends in Social Services in England". It sets out the developments over the past decade in the context of a considerable rise in resources. It gives local authorities the tools for an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
analysis of their use of resources to match current needs and to plan for the future community care services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have clearly shown their commitment to community care and have made substantial resources available. The special grant report provides for the distribution of additional funds to local authorities totalling more than £325 million in 1997. I commend the report to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.37 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ann Coffey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government presented the special transitional grants arrangements in a misleading way. In the 1997–98 Red Book the Government stated that during that period the total standard spending in England—that is, the amount that central Government judge it appropriate for local authorities to spend on revenue expenditure—would be £45.7 billion. Adjusting for transfers, the increase, compared with the figure for 1996–97, is 2.5 per cent. Within that total, provision for community care was increased by £325 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is highly misleading because the £325 million increase in community care is STG funding, and STG funding is not new; it is merely a reallocation of funds from central Government to local Government. The funding replaces the direct funding of previous preserved rights places and residential homes, which are funded by the Department of Social Security through income support. The relevant circular explicitly states that STG is paid to enable social services authortities to meet their new responsibilities. That exposes the absence of any actual increase in funding for community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £325 million is being used to give the impression that funding is being increased when it is not. The 2.5 per cent. overall increase in total standard spending to local authorities is really only 1.8 per cent. when the extra community care STG is discounted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's plan is that social services departments should reduce their spending in cash terms. There is an apparent increase of 4.1 per cent., or £310 million, in total standard spending for personal social services, from £7,536 million to £7,846 million in 1997–98. However, when the £325 million STG transfer is allowed for, that becomes a £15 million cash reduction in funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The elderly residential SSA formula was, I understand, subject to a lengthy review in 1996. The distribution of STG is based on the SSA distribution for social services. The relevant research was undertaken by Kent university, which acted as consultants to the Department of Health. For some reason, Ministers decided to postpone any change—although I gather that the research work was not rejected—but they failed to give any reasons for the postponement. What happened to that review? What notice will the Minister take of it if he is re-elected for some future term of office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 1 May.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Okay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister touched on my third point, which is ring-fencing 85 per cent. of the grant for the independent sector. One of the objectives of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 was the development of alternatives to residential care that would give people a choice of staying at home or going into residential care. There is some concern that the system contains perverse incentives that encourage admission to residential care and that it is not offering the development of service that was hoped for to allow people to live independently in their own homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What comment can the Minister make on the concerns expressed that 85 per cent. is to be spent in the independent sector? Sometimes independent sector provision of domiciliary care is not well developed. However, there is a perverse incentive to spend money on residential care instead of developing alternatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about the cost-effectiveness of the independent sector versus local authority provision. The Labour party is committed to value for money within a framework that takes account of both costs and care standards. We were surprised that the figures produced in the White Paper as evidence of the cost-effectiveness of the independent sector were, to say the least, figures off the back of an envelope, yet the Minister has quoted them again today. The Department of Health has taken the aggregate cost of supported residents in private homes and the same figures for the support of residents in local authority accommodation. From those figures, the Department has come up with an average, which the Minister cited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Minister will be aware that there are no robust figures to establish comparative costs for dependency and care standards between the independent and local authority direct-provision sectors. I agree that it is necessary to be able to develop comparable costs so that people may make decisions on the basis of good financial information and value for money. The Minister should confirm that such information is not now available, and was not available to the Department of Health. It is not right for the Government to say that they have established that the independent sector provides cost-effective services when there is little evidence on which to base that statement, despite their ideological reasons for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady accept the report published last week in her own local authority area, Stockport? It calculated that the cost of a local authority residential home per person per week was £336, while an independent residential home cost £231. Those are independent figures, produced independently in an independent report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course I accept those figures. The joint review said that Stockport gave excellent value for money. I know that authority particularly well and can say that the difference in costs has to do with extra staff training, adaptations to make buildings wheelchair accessible and higher dependency among some residents. The information that I have just given the Minister is not, as he knows, available for every
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
local authority in the land, because the Department of Health simply does not have information about each authority. The Department should have gathered such information long ago if it is serious about getting value for money in spending public funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Thurnham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bolton, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to comment on the figures that the Minister mentioned. I asked the local government associations, which are in the process of coming together to form a new association, to comment on the special transitional grant. The Association of Metropolitan Authorities thought that the figures had been presented in an extremely misleading way—a point that has been made by the hon. Member for Stockport (Ms Coffey)—because the so-called £325 million increase for community care is solely the STG funding, which is not new but merely a reallocation of funding from central Government to local government budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any funding is welcome, but the Minister needs to reflect on the fact that the increases year by year for the past four years have become smaller and smaller. The real-terms increase in 1994–95 was 12.6 per cent.; the folowing year it was half as much—6.1 per cent. The real-terms increase with which we are currently presented is, according to a parliamentary answer on 23 January, 2.4 per cent. An answer that I received from the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Sir P. Beresford), on 16 December shows that, when that increase is adjusted to take account of local authorities' new duties, it means a nil increase. In the case of children's social services, the adjusted figure for the current year was £1,754.7 million and the figure projected for next year's budget is precisely the same: £1,754.7 million, or a nil increase. On the same basis, the allocation for elderly residential social services was £2,557.5 million for the current year. For the coming year, the figure is £2,558.3 million—an increase of £0.8 million which, in real terms, is an increase of 0.004 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year's allocation for elderly domiciliary social services was £1,599.9 million, but the projected figure for the coming year was £1,599.9 million—a nil increase. For other social services, £1,479.2 million was allocated for the current year—the same as for the coming year. There has been no increase whatsoever and the STG was carried into this year—it was originally expected that that would not happen—to obscure that fact. I should like the Minister to acknowledge that fact. Instead of talking only about the increase in the overall figures, he should recognise that, when changes to local authorities' duties and functions are taken into account, there is no increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point was strongly made to me by the AMA, which feels that that is reflected in the lack of care throughout the country. It pointed out that the 1994 general household survey revealed the extent of unmet need and, therefore, of potenial demand. More than half the elderly people who live alone receive no social
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
services help with domestic tasks that they are unable to perform themselves, including a third who cannot bathe or shower themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware that, because of uncertainty about the law, a profusion of cases has arisen. I call on the Government to do everything possible to clarify the law. Goodness only knows why that has not been done already because, if it had been, we would not have had that profusion of cases. The decision about the important Gloucestershire case will be announced at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon from the House of Lords. Until then we do not know what the judgment will be. I asked the Library to supply details of all the other outstanding law cases and I shall not take up the Committee's time by going through all of them. However, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to an example that is relevant to his points about local authorities using the independent sector to a greater extent. He will be aware of yesterday's outcry about the closure of Withyfield home in Buckinghamshire, with elderly residents being given three days to move out. Will the Minister confirm that the difference btween the independent and local authority sectors is that local authorities cannot close their homes in the same way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As that home is in my constituency, may I put it on the record that Buckinghamshire health authority acted quickly and promptly, and all 20 residents have been rehoused?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obviously delighted to hear that they have been rehoused. However, Lorraine Bishop, who works at the home, summed up the feelings of the staff when she said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some of these people fought for us in the war. This country would not be here if it wasn't for them. All this boils down to is money. People don't care about the elderly in this country any more. I am ashamed to be English."</p></blockquote>
I ask the Minister to consider the case of Devon County Council, in which the court decided:
	<br><blockquote><p>"that there was a common-law duty on a local authority to consult with permanent residents in an old people's home before reaching a decision whether or not to close the home. The court said that the residents should be informed well in advance, be given a reasonable time to make objections and to have those objections considered."</p></blockquote>
Clearly, nothing like that happened in the Buckinghamshire case because the elderly people were given just three days to move to another home. They were not, of course, expecting to be disturbed in that way in their final days.

Will the Minister confirm that there is a difference between elderly care homes in the private sector and those in the public sector? There is a clear duty for the public sector to consult before a decision is made to close a home but, if more people are to be housed in private sector old people's homes, we can expect more cases like the Withyfield case. Will he ask his Department urgently to reform community care law by examining how the law works so that we do not have a great sheaf of cases and the sort of uncertainty caused by the Gloucestershire case?

In the paper before us today, annex B, under the heading "Main Features", says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Social services authorities now assess an individual's needs for services and in the light of that assessment decide whether or what services should be provided."</p></blockquote>
There is no mention of resources, but a nil increase for local authorities this year means that resources will be all the more critical. Does the sentence that I quoted from annex B set out the Government's position and how does that reconcile with law cases going through the court, including the Gloucestershire case which brings the matter most to a head?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need to reform all community care law so that the duties and responsibilities of those involved are clearly laid down. We should have reforms to legalise joint commissioning so that health authorities and local authorities can work closely together and make the best use of resources. We should, for example, reform community care direct payments so that local authorities can make the best use of funds by working with health authorities legally instead of being told, as they are at the moment, that it is illegal to merge budgets. The Government could do a great deal to ensure that local authorities use the money more effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Anthony Durant 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Reading, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had no intention of speaking, but the hon. Member for Bolton, North East (Mr. Thurnham) made out that local authorities that run old people's homes are completely honourable. An old people's place was closed arbitrarily by my local authority despite consultation and a petition. Because it would not allow two people to share a room, it closed an excellent home on which it had spent a fortune the year before. Local authorities are no better in that regard. I do not support what might be happening in some other place, but it is not possible to say that all the faults lie in the private sector and that there are no faults in the public sector. That is not my experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a relatively short debate on an important issue that must be determined this side of dissolution and prorogation. I want to pick up several points made by the hon. Member for Stockport and the hon. Member for Bolton. North East, starting with funding. I should like to reassure them—although I suspect that I will be ha	<div class='ob'></div> <!-- ob -->ng at a closed door—that the funding being increased under the STG this year of £325 million is new money, additional to any money that local authorities have had before. It is simply not right to say that we are shuffling money around. This is new money, and I hope that Opposition Members will accept that fact. It may sound unpalatable to them, especially in the heightened political tension of a general election, but it is new money for new community care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not going to say anything until the Minister added two sentences that I do not think he should be allowed to get away with. We all accept that new money is being provided to local authorities but,
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
had there not been a National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, the money would have gone into the Department of Social Security budget. Of course it is new money but it is being provided in order to fulfill responsibilities under that Act, which would otherwise have been paid for from the Department of Social Security budge. It is money that has been moved from one Depatment to another rather than money that has been given to make some addition to the infrastructure. We do not need to belabour the point. If the Minister agrees with that, we can proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to provoke the hon. Lady into intervening again but, although I suspect we will never agree on this, it is not intellectually feasible to make that claim. In March 1997, we do not know how much Department of Social Security money might have been spent. However, we do know that under the order, the Government are providing extra funding for community care, as we have done for the past six years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If no estimate has been made of what Department of Social Security money might have been spent, on what basis are the Government making STG available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are making STG available according to the requirement under the community care policy to give local authorities finance for their extra responsibilities. Now, so many years down the road, we cannot coherently work out how much money the Department of Social Security might have spent. Opposition Members should never forget that between 1997–91 and the forthcoming financial year, there has been a massive increase in funding both for personal social services and for community care. I understand that Opposition Members will not agree with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am sorry but I have several issues to deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also mentioned the issue of deciding whether a person should go into a residential home or stay at home with a domiciliary care package to help them. Of course, as we all understand and agree, the whole ethos of the community care programme is to enable people to stay in their own homes where that is economically and medically feasible. For some individuals, there will come a time when they cannot remain at home, even with a care package, or it may not be financially viable for them to do so because there cannot be an open-ended financial commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From time to time, one hears complaints that implementation of the policy is being tampered with and that people who should remain at home with a care package are put into residential homes. I suspect that much of that evidence is anecdotal. Of course, people must be properly and fully assessed by social services, with some clinical input, to determine what is in their best interests. I do not share the hon. Lady's concerns on that issue, although if she has evidence of the system not working—proper, not anecdotal, evidence—I would welcome the opportunity to see it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0107">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
because, regardless of any political persuasion, we want to ensure that the policy is being carried out effectively and in the best interests of those whom it serves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also raised the question of the two research programmes on the future of SSAs. She is right that, in the light of that research, we decided not to make changes this year, although there was speculation that we would. The reason is that when a system is changed, Ministers must be confident that the change is reasonable and that it improves the allocation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the evidence, we were not convinced that a change would redress any perceived problems. Many Labour councillors from inner London came to see me about the matter, and made strong representations, which reinforced our view that the research work did not redress problems, and that it would be foolish to rush into making changes without being confident that they were right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with most of the points that have been made. I was fascinated by the speech of the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East. I can paraphrase it accurately by saying that the hon. Gentleman implied that, in the White Paper, through the STG and the 85 per cent. requirement, the Government were biased against local authorities, and that Ministers responsible for community care misrepresented or
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
failed to appreciate local authorities and their services. That is a fair summary of the general tenor of the hon. Gentleman's comments. His remarks surprised me. On my first morning at the Department of Health, my first meeting was with the hon. Gentleman. He was not a Liberal Democrat then. However, changing parties cannot fully account for the dramatic change in the hon. Gentleman's attitude. Perhaps he has acquired new habits quickly. We all know that Liberal Democrats say one thing to one audience and something different to another. At the meeting to which I referred, the hon. Gentleman was in the company of private care home owners. He was extremely supportive of them and rather antagonistic towards local authorities. I am sure that he would have welcomed the Secretary of State's White Paper on social services in July last year. Clearly, with the passing of winter and the changing of political parties, the hon. Gentleman has radically changed his views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
