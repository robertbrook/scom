	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Malcolm Moss)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Road Traffic Regulation (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.</p></blockquote>
The Order updates the provisions of the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1981 which deal with regulating the movement of traffic on roads and the parking of vehicles, taking account of current road traffic regulation law in Great Britain. The order is in nine parts, the most significant of which are parts IV, VI, VIII and IX.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part IV provides powers enabling the Department to provide, regulate and manage the use of parking places, both on-street and off-street, and associated facilities. New powers will enable the introduction of residents' on-street parking schemes, counter the illegal use of off-street parking places and permit their use for purposes such as the collection of recyclable materials and for providing access to adjoining premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part VI restates in a restructured and modified form the powers to restrict the speed of traffic on roads and facilitates the use of variable speed limit signs and the setting of minimum speed limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part VIII introduces new measures which are broadly similar to those operating in Great Britain, enabling the police and the Department to remove vehicles from roads and to dispose of those vehicles they consider to have been abandoned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part IX contains a number of miscellaneous provisions, including amendments to the orange badge scheme for disabled drivers, which make it more closely correspond with the scheme operating in Great Britain, and also introduces two new measures. First, except in circumstances to be specified, it will be an offence without reasonable excuse to fail to return a badge to the Department when requested to do so; secondly, the police are to be empowered to inspect a disabled person's badge which is displayed on a vehicle and it will be an offence to fail to produce the badge for inspection on request. Also important are road safety provisions concerned with the safety of pedestrians and the detection of traffic offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will enable the Department of the Environment to regulate the movement of traffic more effectively, to improve its provision and management of off-street and on-street parking places and, with the continued co-operation of the police, to maintain effective enforcement measures. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>4.32 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Dowd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be a little longer than the Minister but, hopefully, not much longer. The order is generally uncontentious, but anything relating to traffic, especially road safety, in Northern Ireland must be taken seriously because Northern Ireland, sadly, has the worst record for road traffic accidents and injuries of any region in the United Kingdom. That record is improving, but it remains the worst.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the order has come forward now because it mirrors in large measure the equivalent legislation in Great Britain, which was passed in 1984. Twelve years may not be a long time, but it coincides with the Department of Transport's review of the provisions of the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions Act 1984. Details of the consultation were released last August and submissions to it were closed in November. We have waited 12 years for the catching-up process and it might have been a better use of everyone's time to have hung on for however long it will take for the Department of Transport to complete its current review and then to move forward together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, the order is before us and generally uncontentious, but any legislation relating to Northern Ireland which includes provision for orange badges need explanation and care, although we all know well that the system is innocuous and enables disabled people to park. Although the matter is generally uncontentious, I would like the Minister to answer some questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome article 5 of Part III, which deals with experimental traffic control schemes—which most of us know of as traffic management schemes—and article 15 of Part IV, which deals with the power to install controlled parking zones, although the technical definition is slightly different. How does the Minister propose to review candidates for traffic management schemes or controlled parking zones? Will he entertain requests from residents' groupings and community groups? To what extent will he liaise with local authorities about where such schemes and zones should be established?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 of Part III and article 18 of Part IV are similar provisions, dealing with the temporary suspension of, respectively, traffic regulation orders and parking places. They give the police the power to suspend the operation of either for up to seven days, after which the consent of the Deartment would be needed. I imagine that in most circumstances, suspensions will be due to relatively minor incidents and last only a few hours. In such cases, it would seem reasonable to leave the power entirely up to the police. However, when a utility needs to carry out work on a public highway, a closure may run to three of four days—in other words, much longer than one day but much less than seven. What provision does the Minister envisgae for co-ordination between the police and the Department on such closures?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Articles 10 and 11 of part IV deal with powers to provide parking places, although the powers provided in article 11 are more for ranging. They include the powers
	<br><blockquote><p>"to provide toilets, rest rooms or other conveniences for use in connection with such parking places"</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"to erect or adapt, and to maintain, equip and manage buildings accordingly"</p></blockquote>
and they provide that premises can be left by the Department
	<br><blockquote><p>"on such terms as it thinks fit".</p></blockquote>
in addition, the Department can
	<br><blockquote><p>"provide services for the benefit of persons occupying or using those parts".</p></blockquote>
That sounds much more like a service area, although not necessarily a motor service area. The provision would apply more to a service area linked to a trunk road than a minor, off-street car park in the middle of Belfast. Will the Minister confirm that if such powers are utilised in the case of service areas, any developments will be subject to normal planning procedures?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part IV deals with parking regulations and includes article 26, in which I could find no reference to the clamping of vehicles that are illegally parked in parking spaces or elsewhere. However, it provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Department may acquire, whether by purchase or hiring, such apparatus as appears to the Department to be required for the purposes of its functions under this Part"</p></blockquote>
and that
	<br><blockquote><p>"'apparatus' includes a parking meter and any device".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister clarify whether that includes clamping or whether seperate legislation will be necessary to enforce clamping of vehicles for parking offences in Northern Ireland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part V, which deals with traffic signs, is generally uncontentios, but—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] I ask the Minister to control his mirth for a moment while I make a general plea—which, I think, will be echoed by motorists and pedestrians throughout the United Kingdom—that the traffic signs should be as uniform as possible and kept to a minimum consistent with providing the information needed by road users.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having finished with part V, I shall move on to part VI—in particular article 42 which deals with exemptions. I am not sure why it is entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"Exemptions for fire engines, etc."</p></blockquote>
when most people refer to such vehicles as emergency vehicles. The explanatory document merely mentions vehicles being used for
	<br><blockquote><p>"fire brigade, ambulance, police or customs purposes".</p></blockquote>
The word "military" has been added to the article. We understand why, in view of the sensitive situation in Northern Ireland, but I should like that change clarified because the military operates under the direction of the Chief Constable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wonder why the definition of ambulance is so precisely worded to include mobile coronary care units while excluding vehicles used for the transportation of human organs for transplant or emergency blood supplies. I see that the Minister has a good reason for that, which I look forward to hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
I have nothing to say on part VII which deals with traffic wardens—I am sure we all love them. However, articles 48 and 49 of part VIII give the police and the Department respectively the power to remove vehicles for disposal or destruction. In particular, they allow them to place a seven-day destruction notice on a vehicle where
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Department considers that the vehicle is in such a condition that it ought to be destroyed."</p></blockquote>
The same power applies to a constable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where ownership of a vehicle is established, paragraphs 51 and 52 allow a notice to be revoked and for the vehicle to be returned to the owner. How does establishing ownership overcome the problem that a vehicle is, in the opinion of the Department or the police, in such a condition that it should be destroyed? If it is a matter or road safety, merely establishing ownership will not solve the problem. Where licensed vehicles have to be kept until such time as the licence expires before they are disposed of or destroyed, is there a provision in part VIII for clamping vehicles that are in violation of vehicle duty requirements—for example, those without road tax—similar to measures recently introduced in Great Britain?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 64 of Part IX needs clarification. It allows for equipment to be installed to detect traffic offences which, at its heart, means speed cameras. The article states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Department may install and maintain on or near a road, structures and equipment for the detection of traffic offences."</p></blockquote>
During the passage of the Road Traffic Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order 1996, provision for the police to be able to use in evidence material obtained specifically from speed cameras was included. I am slightly confused that the police could use in evidence something that there was no legal basis to collect. [Interruption.] The Minister indicates hands held to me, and I can only ask him to clarify that the matter has been resolved and that evidence, however so derived, can be used in the conviction of those suspected of speeding offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the explanatory document suggests that there are no financial or staffing implications. That is difficult to reconcile with the employment of traffic wardens, the imposition of fines and other income that the order will permit. We would be grateful if the Minister could say a word about that, as well as about whether the surplus—we hope that there will be one—generated by the parking fines and charging regime will be applied separately or will simply be absorbed into the Department's budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.44 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order is, as usual, very detailed and quite extensive. I understand from the Minister's comments that it will bring the Northern Irish road traffic legislation more or less into line with the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise a few items. I was interested to read article 3 which mentions which side of the road one is supposed to drive on—whether in a car or other vehicle or on a horse. The article mentions animals, so I assume that it means horses. It would be difficult to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
keep cattle to the left-hand side of the road. In the country, it is the established practice that a person walking down a country road walks on the right-hand side so that it is possible to see traffic coming and to allow it to go by on the person's left. What happens if that person is leading a horse? Should it be led on the left or the right-hand side of the road? Which should break the law and which fulfil it? Perhaps the Minister could give us an opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 19 refers to drivers who use a car park and pay a fee as well as to those who, having paid a fee, go away and do not come back quickly enough—those who overstay the time that they are supposed to have in the car park. If they do that, they are guilty of an offence under the legislation. Yet article 20 provides a get-out, which I would like the Minister to explain. Article 20 allows the Department to accept payment for the offence and not to pursue the offender once that has been done. Why has that measure been included?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 27 deals with manned car parks where a fee is requested. Under its proposals, the Department accepts responsibility for damage or theft only if it or its representative is negligent. I tried to think of examples where that would be the case. Would the attendant be negligent if one car, which he was directing, drove into another? Could the Minister give us an example of how the Department could be deemed negligent in such circumstances?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part IV covers articles 10 to 27 and is very extensive; it covers many subjects. I want to ask the Minister about a fear and about a few matters that have been raised with me by my hon. Friends the Members for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) and for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs). In Northern Ireland and other parts of the United Kingdom we have a problem with travellers and parking. Does the regulation deal with that matter? People travel around the countryside, stop in lay-bys and stay there for a long time. There seems to be great difficulty getting them to move on, even though no toilet facilities or water are available. Earlier we discussed facilities that are provided in some parking places. What is the Minister's thinking on the matter? It has been suggested that when lay-bys are used regularly by travellers, it might be sensible to have a time-limited scheme whereby anyone using a lay-by would be able to do so only for a short time and if he stayed longer he would be breaking the law. The regulation is wide-ranging and perhaps could include that suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to hear that consideration is being given to residents' parking schemes. The largest towns and cities, including Belfast, have problems with residents' parking. People drive into an area early in the morning and park in the street instead of in a car park, so that residents sometimes cannot get out of their home with, for example, a pram. There should also be controls in small housing estates, into which people drive, park their cars and leave; no one can move the obstructing vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Many people have been disturbed by the new idea—it may not be new in the rest of the United Kingdom, but it is new in Northern Ireland—of charging hospital visitors for parking their cars in hospital grounds. It would be most unfortunate if people visiting a patient who was dangerously ill could not find any parking, but it would be even worse if they were charged various amounts for visiting their relatives. Will the regulation deal with that matter? Sometimes, folk park in the hospital car park, leave their car locked, go down the road, get on a bus and go into Belfast to do their shopping or to work. The regulation should deal with that, so that those visiting a hospital are not inconvenienced, either by having to pay or by being unable to park.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When discussing such legislation we should always bear in mind the need to provide disabled parking. The Minister earlier mentioned the orange badge scheme. More disabled parking is required and that which is currently available should be more stringently controlled to prevent other people from using it. I want to discuss one such problem. In the middle of a car park in Antrim there is a toilet that serves the local business area. Those who are not disabled can walk from the business area to the toilet to use it. Unfortunately, disabled people driving into Antrim who wish to make use of the facility have to drive into the car park and pay a parking fee before they can do so. I know that that is only one example, but I hope that the Minister will deal with it in the regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my colleagues have suggested to me that it would be sensible for car parking for shopping to be free for the first hour. The Minister should consider granting that facility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 31, which deals with roadworks, differs from similar provisions in the Street Works (Northern Ireland) Order 1995. Under the provisions of that article, who will be responsible if an accident occurs at a roadworks? For example, a track might be dug in a road and the traffic might be filtered past the roadworks using stop—go signs. If someone ignored the signs and there was a minor or major collision, who, under the article, would be responsible? I have noticed that occassionally the workmen who operate stop—go signs are out of earshot of each other, and that they communicate by signs. I hope that collisions will not occur, but if one does, who will be responsible? It would be unfair to blame one of the workmen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 47 deals with abandoned cars. I understand that one is not allowed to park cars or lorries on the grass verges bordering some major roads—except, of course, in an emergency. If a car is abandoned on a grass verge, what offence is being committed? Sadly, cars are abandoned in Northern Ireland for all sorts of reasons. I am puzzled, or perhaps I should say slightly concerned, about the fact that seven days' notice is required before anything can be done about abandoned cars. Under the regulation, will the police be able to get a car taken away more quickly? Why is the consent of a council required? If a police officer thinks that a car should be removed, should not that be enough? Why is it necessary to take the matter to the council, which suggests that the council's permission is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
needed to remove the car? I may be speaking against myself on this matter, but I suspect that most councils would be happy to have cars removed without their involvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to note that road safety is dealt with in the regulation. As we have already heard, road safety in Northern Ireland needs to be improved. I hope that there will be no reduction in the number of road safety officers in Northern Ireland. They and Schoolteachers do an excellent job to impress on young people the importance of road safety. I hope that that will be borne in mind at all times. In Northern Ireland, there is a great need for instruction about road safety.

Article 70 mentions the Crown and affects employees in the Department of the Environment. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Department may make regulations exempting from the provisions of this Order, or of any regulation or order made under this Order, vehicles and persons in the public service of the Crown."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister explain that measure and the circumstances in which it would be required? A similar measure is mentioned in earlier articles covering ambulances and other vehicles, which have been given permission to undertake various activities. Does the provision raise the matter of diplomatic privilege?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd) said that Northern Ireland had the worst road safety record of any region of the United Kingdom. I take umbrage at that. The hon. Gentlemen did not classify what a region is, but we have made tremendous progress in Northern Ireland. We have reaffirmed our target of a one third reduction in road safety fatalities and serious injuries by 2000 from our baseline of 1981–85. By 1995, we had achieved a 29 per cent. reduction. We have done extremely well. There are still too many deaths and injuries, but our approach adopts many different measurements from across the board to ensure that we improve the record even further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lewisham, West asked why it had taken so long to lay the order before the House, bearing in mind that it replicates many of the clauses and conditions enshrined in the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. This order is the fourth in a series, and I think that the hon. Gentlemen was present on a number of occasions when we introduced the various orders. Initially, we had to make a judgment about the priorities for all the road traffic orders. This is deemed to be the fourth in terms of priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a review of the 1984 legislation, but that will take some time and will have to go out to consultation. Time will have to made for it in the House, so it is unlikely to reach the statute book for another couple of years. We felt it to be important,
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
albeit that we are some years behind, to press on with the order because it fits in nicely with the previous three orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Lewisham, West asked about parking zones and what discussions would take place. Hitherto, we have been unable, in inner-city areas, especially of Belfast, to control parking in the interests of the residents, which had carefully to consider. The hon. Member for South Antrim (Mr. Forsythe) also made the point that, increasingly, people working in central Belfast have not got into the usual parking places, but have parked on the streets, which had caused considerable difficulty for residents in many inner-city areas. We attempted to address the problem by putting down double yellow lines, but that means that residents cannot park in front of their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will enable us to make the necessary changes—which have been in force in Great Britain for many years—to bring in resident parking schemes. We have already had expressions of interest for such schemes, especially from people in Belfast, and they are also planned for Ballymena. Proper statutory consultation procedures will be carried out before any such schemes become operative. There will be a time scale of a year from the order coming into operation. In line with the practice in many local authority areas in other parts of the United Kingdom, a charge is anticipated for the issue of residents' parking permits, mainly to cover administration costs. We shall hold discussions on the level of cost later.

The hon. Members for Lewisham, West and for South Antrim raised the issue of wheel clamping. The hon. Member for Lewisham, West is right to say that no reference is made to wheel clamping in the legislation. Obviously we considered that matter but, after consultation—with the police in particular—it was concluded that the problem with illegal parking in Northern Ireland did not warrant the introduction of wheel clamping. Moreover, the police would not wish to undertake that task at present, given the security situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to a question by the hon. Member for South Antrim, I can say that wheel clamping will not be used in connection with the removal and disposal of vehicles from roads. The emphasis will be on clearing such obstructions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lewisham, West asked about article 11, which provides additional powers to develop associated services for off-street parking places. That is a catch-all provision, enabling those in charge of such car parks to do virtually anything they want within reason. However, I can confirm that any of those services and proposals will be subject to the strictures of the planning authority and will need full planning applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Referring to article 42, the hon. Member for Lewisham, West asked about exemptions from speed limits. That article mentions fire engines and military vehicles. He was right to say that, in the context of Northern Ireland, it makes sense to allow military vehicles, particularly bomb disposal vehicles, to break speed limits. He also asked for a definition of an ambulance, which remains as in all current legislation.

The article does not apply to vehicles with transplant organs because, to my knowledge, no transplant surgery is carried out in Northern Ireland. I cannot answer his question on the issue of blood supply, but I shall write to him when I have details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lewisham, West also referred to article 64, which deals with the maintenance and placing of structures by the roadside to monitor speeding offences. He is right to assume that the Road Traffic Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 made it possible for the first time for the police to prosecute people with evidence from speed cameras, but that legislation did not include provision to erect structures to carry the cameras. Under that legislation, therefore, any case that went to court would use evidence from hand-held cameras or cameras in a vehicle at the roadside. The order introduces the possibility of erecting permanent structures to carry cameras for detecting such offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Gentleman queried our statement that the order would have no significant impact on public expenditure. Many car parks are owned by the Department of the Environment, Northern Ireland, but the income from that parking is taken into account when the Department's budgets are finalised through the normal negotiations, so it is offset against deemed resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have covered most of the points raised by the hon. Member for Lewisham, West, but I shall be more than happy to scrutinise 	<i>Hansard</i> and to write to him about anything that I have overlooked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the questions asked by the hon. Member for South Antrim. He started by asking what seemed to be an obvious question, but it was a difficult one. He asked what someone who is asked to ride a horse on the left side of the road but to walk on the right side if the horse is being led, should do. Answer is there none. The recommendation in the rules of the road is that any movement of animals, whether being ridden or driven should be on the left whenever possible. There may be a slight imbalance in the recommendation, but our advice remains the same—to move on the left if possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to parking in hospital car parks. He alluded to the fact that people increasingly drive to the outskirts of the city, park their cars free at a hospital car park—the Ulster hospital car park may have the most offenders—and then catch the bus or transfer to someone else's car for the short journey into town. One reason for introducing car parking charges is to prevent such abuse. The car parks involved are not covered by the order because they are privately owned by the hospitals. The matter is primarily for the hospitals, but we do not want their car parks to be abused in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to parking for disabled people and said that more parking and better policing is needed for those with orange badges. The way in which the order deals with the orange badge
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
scheme is an attempt to do that. For the first time in legislation it will be an offence not to present an orange badge to a policeman when requested to do so. We hope to tighten up on that and we are negotiating with groups representing disabled people on access to Belfast city centre and so on. Special parking places for disabled people will be provided if we move ahead with pedestrianisation of city centre streets. We hope to make an announcement soon. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that parking for disabled people is vital and that it should not be abused. People should not park in places that are reserved for disabled drivers or abuse the orange badge scheme. The hon. Gentleman asked a question about article 31. He will find that it refers to road works that are off the road. Works on the road or the pavement come under the Street Works (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 and the article spells that out. Responsibility for accidents would fall on the people who carry out the work and place the signs. The hon. Gentleman also referred to grass verges. Technically, they are part of the road and, therefore, the legislation will apply to them, as it applies to cars that are abandoned on the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Antrim also referred to road safety officers, a matter that came up in an earlier debate on an earlier order. I am mindful of the points that were raised then and asked for a review of the situation. The British Institute of Traffic Education Research considered the work of road safety education officers in Northern Ireland and recommended higher staffing levels. However, with the constraints on public expenditure and the downward pressure on departmental running costs, it is not clear how we would find extra resources to increase those numbers in the short term. The staffing level was 16 in 1991 and will fall to 11 during the coming financial year. I state clearly today that that will not fall below 11, and I shall examine carefully the possibility in future public expenditure rounds of increasing that slightly. Road safety is important and we must ensure that the right information is given to our children to prevent further accidents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about exemptions under article 70. The article is generally similar to article 214 of the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1981, which was considered to be flawed because it did not appear to apply to orders made under a provision of the order. The order before us redresses that deficiency. It is a drafting improvement that will not produce any change in the way in which the road service currently interprets and uses the provision.
