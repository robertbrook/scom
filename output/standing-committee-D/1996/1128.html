</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although you were not in the Chair, Sir Michael, I wish to apologise to the Committee for my late appearance at our previous sitting and my rather abrupt departure from it. In return for disrupting the Committee in that way, I intend to be brief in speaking to the amendments, something on which I am sure the Government Whip will be keeping a check.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State has said many times that he is delighted that the Bill is permissive. Given that he is so keen on permissive legislation, I am sure that he will support the amendments. I propose that we change the provisions in the Bill from being over-prescriptive to merely permissive. The amendments would remove from the Bill the requirement that governing bodies must consider annually whether they wish to change the status of the school from non-selective to selective. At present, governing bodies are extremely hard-pressed in their work and I want to reduce the pressure that is placed on them to undertake unnecessary tasks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current legislation in respect of grant-maintained status requires all governing bodies to consider annually whether their schools become grant maintained. Although that is a requirement, it might surprise Conservative Members—it certainly does not surprise Opposition Members—to know that despite such a requirement, in the past 12 months, only one half of 1 per cent. of all eligible schools decided to hold a ballot on grant-maintained status. Governing bodies have no desire to go down that route and the same is true in respect of schools that are currently non-selective, but which will be required to consider whether they wish to become selective. A large amount
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
of time will be wasted by governing bodies deciding what to do and then concluding, as I suspect that they will, that they have no desire to take their schools down a selective route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would remove that requirement from the majority of our schools, which are currently non-selective. They would merely require schools that are currently selective to consider annually whether they wish to continue being selective and to explain why. The amendments are permissive; they would make it possible for the governing bodies of non-selective schools to consider annually—they could consider this each month if they wished—whether to become selective. The proposals would simply remove the requirement that they must consider changing their status when I am convinced, as I am sure are most people in the country, that they will have no desire to do so. I am sure that the Under-Secretary of State will welcome such a proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mrs. Cherly Gillan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) has been so brief in moving the amendment, I shall do him the courtesy of being brief in reply. If he thinks about it, he will realise that the amendment is a wrecking amendment and would apply the clause to wholly selective schools only. He is trying to be quite ingenious, turning the clause so that it has completely the opposite effect to that which is intended. He would make it a requirement that wholly selective schools should consider reducing the proportion of selected places that they offer but not that other schools should consider introducing or extending selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What sets the Government apart from the Liberal Democrats is that we are committed to extending choice and diversity and they are obviously committed to reducing it. He is wrong; parents do indeed want more selection, not less. We want schools that are not wholly selective to consider introducing or extending selection as part of their strategy for improving standards and responding to parental wishes. I do not see a large extra burden being put on governors because considering whether to introduce partial or full selection should fit in with the best practice of schools that consider regularly whether to respond to parental wishes in such respects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification on that important point. The Under-Secretary of State should make clear whether she is committed to diversity or to selection. We are not sure, because we are being given different messages by the Under-Secretary, the Minister of State and Conservative Back Benchers. If the Government are committed to diversity, why did they not accept the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) at the previous sitting, which would have allowed governing bodies to consider whether to extend selection or to reduce it? That would fit with the Under-Secretary's commitment to diversity. To the hon. Lady, diversity seems to mean selection. Will she clarify that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady knows that the Government are committed to choice and to diversity. If she had listened to what I said at the previous sitting, she would have heard me say that there was absolutely nothing to prevent a school considering whether to seek to reduce or end its selective arrangements, but that we had no intention of requiring it to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that there is a permissive power that enables schools to consider moving away from selection. Why should there be a compulsion on schools to consider moving to selection, but no compulsion to consider moving away from selection? Will the Under-Secretary explain that difference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady knows that the Government consider it important for governors to consider that matter on an annual basis. No school stands still. Demands may be made by parents and it is right that they should be considered year by year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is precisely because schools do not stand still and because times change that schools should constantly reconsider all sorts of matters—including, in this instance, their admission policies. However, I do not understand why it should be compulsory for one set of schools to do so but only permissive for another set of schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite simple; we believe that it is important that school governors should consider the matter each and every year. The clause does not place any requirement on schools to introduce or extend selection. It requires governing bodies only to consider the matter. I therefore urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an incredibly disappointing response. The Under-Secretary said that the Government believe that it important for schools to consider the matter on an annual basis. If a Minister says such a thing in Committee, one would expect reasons to be given. All I can glean from what she said is that she thinks that it is important because parents want "more selection, not less". Logically, the two statements do not follow. There is no evidence that parents on the whole want more selection. The Minister has given us no evidence; indeed, she cannot give us any evidence, because there is none.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman seen the Association of Teachers and Lecturers survey that was published on 22 January 1996? In my attempt to be brief, I perhaps did not give him the full picture. The survey was carried out by the Harris research centre. One of the questions was whether the respondents
	<br><blockquote><p>"agree or disagree that the government should return to a fully selective system, with grammar schools, secondary modern schools and an 11-plus examination".</p></blockquote>
Overall, 54 per cent. of the respondents agreed. That is the evidence. There is a demand from parents for selection to be considered, and that is what we are doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>170</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. The Minister is now using that evidence to support what the Government are doing, but that does not sit squarely with her saying on Second Reading that the Government do not intend to move back to a fully selective system with grammar schools, secondary modern schools and the 11-plus. The evidence that she uses does not support her case; perhaps she should look at the Gallup poll survey, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and her colleagues have said on numerous occasions that they want permissive, not prescriptive, legislation, yet if the amendments are not accepted the legislation will be prescriptive, not permissive. Schools will be required to do something that is of the Government's bidding, which will politicise governing bodies. They will not even be able to ask what sort of selection is appropriate for them. The only question that they will be allowed to ask is whether, as the Government want, they should increase the proportion of selection. The measure is not permissive; it is prescriptive, and it should not be included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is important and we should have a more lengthy debate about it. To give us that opportunity, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 109, in page 2, line 9, leave out "unless" and insert"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 110, in page 2, line 11, after "wholly", insert "or partly".</p>
	<p>No. 111, in page 2, line 21, after "(a)" insert "no".</p>
	<p>No. 112, in page 2, line 23, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"(where such provision is already made) provision for an increase",</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>and insert 'provision for a decrease'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to move the amendments. It seems to be the order of the day to be brief, as it was before our proceedings finally came to an end late on Tuesday, so I shall be brief now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be a fundamental confusion among Conservative Members. The Minister of State and the Under-Secretary of State seem to be adding to that confusion with each contribution that they make—their arguments are falling apart before our eyes. Are the Government in favour of selection or not? If so, the legislation would not be permissive, as the Minister keeps telling us it is; schools would be required to become selective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members are much clearer on the matter. We are in touch with parents and we know what they think—parents do not, on the whole, want selection. That is especially important in those areas where a comprehensive is performing well—the Under-Secretary of State visited a such a school in Tavistock. On the same day, she went to St. Boniface college in my constituency. I did not accompany her on that occasion as I wanted to allow her visit to go ahead with ease—a huge media scrum follows me whenever I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>171</span>
travel around my constituency. I think that a photographer popped in, but the photograph taken was unusable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are much more clear about such matters. We believe that there should not be selection. We certainly believe that selection should not happen because of a small group of governors who could be unrepresentative of the local community and the parents who aspire to send their children to a certain school. A much wider view is required. The amendment would require partially or wholly selective schools to examine each year whether they want either to go down the selective route or reduce selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Kilfoyle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Walton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware of any evidence that governors want such a responsibility to be foisted on them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have tried to tease that out during our debates. No delegation of governors from either the secondary or the primary sector has ever told me that it would like to go selective; neither has a group of teachers or parents—the important people—told me that it wants selection. I quizzed the Minister of State about that during the previous sitting; he is now physically reeling under the force of my argument. I asked him how many parents in Worcester had contacted him, demanding that their schools should go selective, and he made it clear that the number was zero. That is also the experience of Opposition Members. If there was a moment of honesty on the Conservative Benches, Conservative Members would say that that their mailbags show that there is no parental demand for selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned Solihull during an intervention on the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Barking. In 1971, I was the whole opposition in Solihull; I was the only Labour councillor—all the others were Conservatives. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) is smiling, as he has some knowledge of that part of the country. The interesting point is that the comprehensive system was introduced there after widespread, thorough consultation. That will not happen under the Bill. At that time in Solihull, the balance of the argument was against changing the system. However, after exhaustive consultation, the balance shifted heavily for change—parents wanted their schools to go comprehensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In about 1984, one or two people on the authority tried to reverse that decision and return to selection. I happened to be in Solihull then and I saw blue-rinse ladies holding placards that said, "Keep our Comprehensives. No to the 11-plus." I was struck by the fact that those people said, "No to the 11-plus. No to selection." I then heard them say that they did not want secondary-modern schools back in their area. Given the success of the schools in the area, I understood why they did not want to return to selection and the 11-plus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would create a balance. Ministers say that governors of non-selective schools should be required to consider each year whether their school should become partly selective. However, it is only
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
right that they should also consider moving in the opposite direction. As with ballots to go grant maintained, ballots can be held until the answer is right, but they cannot be held to go in the opposite direction. If Conservative Members truly believed in democracy, they would have allowed a ballot that would enable parents to move in the opposite direction. I know one or two schools that would like to move back to the LEA because their experience of being grant maintained has not been entirely happy. It is a question of getting the balance of the legislation right. I hope that the amendment helps the Minister: it creates that balance and allows fairness to governors of grammar schools and selective schools, giving them choice so that they, too, can introduce diversity into their schools. There must be grammar and selective schools that would also like to change their admission arrangements and become partly non-selective so that they can take in a wider diversity of children and give children in the area greater opportunities to come to the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said I would be brief; I have kept my solemn promise to the Committee and I look forward to the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, Members on the Opposition side of the Committee—but of a different party—are trying to turn the clause on its head and create a one-way street so that wholly or partly selective schools have to consider whether to reduce selection. There is nothing to prevent such schools from considering whether to reduce or end their selective arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it possible for a non-selective school to select some of its pupils under the existing provisions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows the answer to that. At present, up to 15 per cent. of pupils can be selected and that is being extended under the Bill. Opposition Members seem incapable of understanding that the Bill is about extending, not reducing, choice and diversity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right that the Bill is about increasing selection? The Minister referred to the amendment as a one-way street—but is not the clause a one-way street, in the direction of selection?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. The Bill is about choice and the clause about school governors considering every year whether to go selective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) surprised me. Everyone will have noted his gross attack on governors when he moved his amendment. He said that they are unrepresentative of the local population; he should know that about a third of governing bodies have to be elected by parents. I hope that he will read 	<i>Hansard</i> and reconsider his remarks. I urge the Committee to reject the amendments, for the same reasons as I urged them to reject the previous amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>173</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an extraordinary response. I was not attacking governing bodies: I said that they are sometimes unrepresentative of the local community. They tend to comprise a small number of people and do not represent the wider interests of the community. In particular, the governors of a secondary school do not represent the parents of primary school pupils who aspire to send their children to that school—those parents are important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady says that the amendment would create a one-way street, but the clause is a one-way street. Like the legislation on grant-maintained schools, the legislation has a ratchet effect, taking schools gradually in the direction of selection with no turning back. The Opposition are saying that if the legislation is to be fair and reasonable, it must be a two-way street. If the Minister can present arguments that schools should go from non-selection to selection, is it not right and fair that selective schools should be able to become non-selective? Should not the governors—who the Minister said are representative—decide each year whether to go in the opposite direction? If she were to accept the amendment and that were to happen, we should have a little more faith in her contention that the provisions are about creating choice and diversity. The clause and the Bill are not about that; they are about creating a ratchet effect and a one-way street to selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have presented no evidence in Committee or in any other forum of the House to convince us that anyone wants selection. The only people who want to be heard and seen to be talking about selection are Conservative Members, who think that there is some electoral advantage in doing so. If parents found out that their local comprehensive was going to become selective without any consultation with local people, Conservative Members would reap a bitter electoral harvest. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
I shall be brief, just as my hon. Friends have been this morning. The amendment is helpful, and I hope that the Government will consider it as such. If the Government are determined to go ahead with the provisions of the clause—with which I do not agree—the amendment would at least provide that they ask governing bodies to consider the impact of their decision on neighbouring schools. That is common sense. Unlike the amendments that we have just considered, this one would not prevent governing bodies considering whether to select; in that respect, it is helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take the view that if one school decides to become selective, not only that school but others will change in nature and character. All experience of a selective education system shows that to be the case. If one school chooses to select, the ability, potential and interest of children in neighbouring schools may change over time. Another effect is that some children will no longer be able to attend their local school, and may have to travel past schools that they may have wanted to attend to reach schools with sufficient places for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One school's decision to select changes the whole neighbourhood school structure. It is up to the individual hon. Members to decide whether that is good or not, but it is indisputably the case. When we allow a school to take from one neighbourhood children who show general abilitiy or potential and ability in certain specialisms, that is bound to have an impact on other neighbourhood schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would not take away schools' right to consider whether to select, but it would require them to judge their actions according to not only their interests but the interests of all schools, parents and children in the locality. All those interested in education want to ensure that children do not suffer because of their decisions. I do not believe that governing bodies or head teachers want to run a system under which their actions disadvantage others, but unless we pass an amendment such as this, that is exactly what will happen. No school is an island; no school can take decisions on admissions arrangements without having a wider impact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have throughout the debate on the Bill made the mistake of thinking that diversity can be brought about by admissions arrangements; that mistake blinds them to wider measures that could raise standards. The Government's notion of diversity is defined in terms of admissions arrangements. What makes schools diverse? What makes them different? What changes their character? What gives parents real choice? It is what happens within schools that is important: how they teach; the relationships between parents and teachers; extra-curricular activities; homework; uniform; values and ethos. We have said it all before—that is what makes schools different. The Government do not understand that and keep telling us that it is how pupils are admitted that makes schools different. That is a serious flaw because it gives a sign to schools that the only thing that will make them diverse and different from their neighbours is to change their admissions arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I underscore what my hon. Friend said about schools being different. There are four comprehensive schools in my constituency, all of which are quite different, but the common thread is that they all want the best for their pupils. The differences are partly due to the different interests and activities with which the teachers want to be involved. Having selection will not increase diversity. It might make it more difficult for some schools to continue with what they do now, but it will do nothing to improve diversity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. To be perfectly even-handed and to emphasise that we mean what we say, I tell the Committee that I do not believe that any two grant-maintained schools or city technology colleges are the same. The notion that because schools have the same admission arrangements they are somehow the same, or grey, monolithic and without character, is a flaw in the Government's reasoning. Unless they have the courage to get over that weakness in their argument, we shall be dogged by legislation that will not raise standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recall, as I do, having met many GM school head teachers, that an individual school's ethos, style and approach are the most important things to that school, and are often claimed as the reason for it becoming grant maintained. It reinforces my hon. Friend's argument for it becoming grant maintained. It reinforces my hon. Friend's argument that the individuality of the school is all important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right and he will know that the GM head teachers whom we have met on numerous occasions—rather too many to mention—do not want to return to selection. They acknowledge that their schools are individual and different, even though they all admit pupils in the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fundamental difference in the Committee. The Government believe that the only way in which to have diversity between schools is to change how pupils are admitted, whereas the Opposition believe that diversity in schools and real choice for parents can be achieved by allowing each school to develop its own ethos, culture and values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the old days, when we had a wholly selective system of entry at age 11—much as I did not like it—there was at least some semblance of order in the admission arrangements. Admission to schools followed one examination—the 11-plus—and all schools knew where they stood. Parents and children were notified of the results of the exam and the name of the school to which the children had been allocated on the same day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems that the Government have not considered is that under this legislation, every school can develop its own admissions procedure. There is nothing in the Bill allowing for co-operation within a local authority on admissions procedure. There is a CTC in my constituency that is not within the local authority, but in Solihull, and it takes pupils from my constituency. One of the problems is that the CTC,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
which selects by parental interview, does not let the children know the result until after Easter—about April—in the year preceding entry. Therefore, local comprehensive schools do not know which children will come through their doors until very late.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a possibility that because schools will be encouraged to be individual, to take no notice of the impact of their decisions on other schools, to develop their own admission arrangements and not to co-operate with other schools, there will be as many different admissions procedures as they are schools in a neighbourhood. Schools will not know where they stand. They will not know what next year's intake will be and will not be able to begin the important job of preparing children in year 6 for their move to year 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents should be able to prepare their children for transfer at the age of 11, but they will not be able to do so because, potentially, they will not know until the summer holidays which school their children will attend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may be aware of the submission made by the Association of Grant Maintained and Aided Schools on the White Paper. On selection, the association stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many parents of very able children would prefer to retain them in the local comprehensive school in which they had confidence, but the choice and opportunity would be available for them. The White Paper proposals will produce a mishmash".</p></blockquote>
Does my hon. Friend agree with those sentiments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The association is right, and its view is shared by many other organisations and groups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An equally important submission was made by the Funding Agency for Schools. The agency said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The admission arrangements of a particular school impact upon the provision of places in an area. The proposed change in the legislation to allow GM schools to introduce up to 50 per cent. selection without the need to publish statutory proposals is likely to create a more complex planning situation."</p></blockquote>
If a Government agency is raising alarm signals about the impact of that provision, the Government should accept the amendment to bring some planning sense to the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Barking is absolutely right. I do not know of any organisation, or indeed, anyone who thinks that schools should be able to change their admissions arrangements without regard to the impact on neighbouring schools. It is plain common sense. Sadly, in one Bill after another, we have seen that the Government do not want to listen. The difference today is that they will not be in power to correct their mistakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport said at our first sitting, more than 30 amendments are being made to legislation that was considered by both Houses only last year. There is a serious flaw in such legislation. On this occasion, my argument is not about the principle of selection, although I disagree with it. The Government may be intent on selection, determined to make schools consider it and prepared to take measures to encourage them to do so.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>177</span>
However, they must realise that the impact of a school's decision to select could be dire for the parents and children of neighbouring schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a responsibility not only to the schools that introduce selection and to those schools' children and parents, but to the children and parents of other schools in the same area. Those other schools, and the parents and children, are at risk of being harmed, and the Bill will make it more difficult to raise standards. This is not a wrecking amendment; it is a serious attempt to put an element of sensible planning into a system that could otherwise become chaotic. I urge the Minister to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris) that the amendment is important. I hope that the Minister will look beyond the dogma to some of the facts. I ask her please to try to answer us, so that we can understand a little of the logic behind the Government's proposals. To make that slightly easier, I shall discuss in more detail today the two authorities that I mentioned last week. One is Kent—two members of the Committee represent Kent seats—and the other is Hampshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those two authorities are not dissimilar in their socio-economic make up. Another reason for my using those authorities as examples is that they are fairly large. Kent is much larger than Hampshire and has about 30 per cent. more schools—125, compared with Hampshire's 93. I totted those figures up from the league tables published in a newspaper last week. Kent has grammar schools and has had them for some time, but Hampshire does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>in the Chair.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, I said that Kent's average of five A to C-grades at GCSE was 43·7 per cent., whereas Hampshire's was 46·5 per cent. So on a crude basis, and working on the assumption that they are not dissimilar areas—which I hope the Minister will accept—Hampshire with its comprehensive schools is doing better than Kent with its mixture of grammar and comprehensive schools. The Chairman is looking at me—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening most intently to the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No Member representing Kent—and certainly no Opposition Member—would dream of saying that Kent children are any less able, or to put it another way, any more stupid than Hampshire children. So let us examine whether the different systems of education in the two LEAs might begin to explain that difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. lady seriously saying that she has discovered a new rule on the basis of a difference of less than 3 per cent.? There are enormous differences between Hampshire and Kent, which would easily account for the 2.8 per cent. difference. Throughout our debate, we have pointed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
out that in many areas there are differences of 10 or 15 per cent. The people of Kent are happy with the selective system, which has been enormously successful in getting pupils who pass the 11-plus—and also large numbers of those who do not pass it—into university.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will be patient, I shall question whether all Kent people are happy and satisfied with the current organisation. If the hon. Gentleman brings to the Committee evidence that the two LEAs are different in their socio-economic makeup, I shall listen to it with pleasure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, by saying that a 3 per cent. difference in standards does not matter, the hon. Gentleman is attacking his own Government. There was no difference between the 1994 and 1995 GCSE results, yet the Government claimed that they were improving schools; in 1996, there was a 1 per cent. improvement and when that result was published, the Government jumped up and down, saying that it constituted a massive improvement. So in the past two years, we have had an average 0.5 per cent. annual improvement and the Government take that as a fulfilment of their policy to raise standards—whilst the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) says that the 3 per cent. difference between Kent and Hampshire is irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I welcome our new temporary Chairman to the Chair?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Lady explain how that point relates to the amendment? As I understand it, the amendment would require governing bodies to have regard to certain criteria. I am finding it hard to follow the hon. Lady's argument and to relate it to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister will allow me to continue my argument, she will quickly understand its relevance. I know that she is in a hurry—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in a hurry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, she is looking at her watch and at the clock. What I am saying is the kernel of the argument behind the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Yardley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have established that there is a 3 per cent. difference between Kent and Hampshire. The Committee—with the exception, perhaps, of the hon. Member for Dover—will accept that 3 per cent. represents a considerable difference in outcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether we could ask the hon. Member for Dover to expand on his remark that he believed that there were good reasons why Kent should perform less well than Hampshire. I am sure that the electorate in Dover would be interested to know what those reasons are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that the hon. Member for Dover should explain those matters unless he catches my eye and I call him to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand by your ruling, Mr. Arnold, but I should be happy to give way to the hon. Member for Dover if he wants to assist the Committee. If he does not choose to contribute, I shall take it that he has no explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady accept that I have plenty of explanations but that, as you said, Mr. Arnold, it would be out of order for me to give them? I rise to say not only that I can give explanations, but that the education system in Dover is a jolly sight better than that in Islington or Barking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Interestingly, I already intended to compare outcomes in Kent with those areas, including Barking and Islington, so I suggest that the hon. Member for Dover holds his fire until he has the facts rather than the prejudice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee of one of the most important issues in education. The problem is not the achievement of the top group, or those with the greatest ability—they will always do well. Britain lags behind all our international competitors because of the long tale of underachievement. I know that Conservative Members do not like it but I refer again to the Conservative Education Association, which I believe knows slightly more about education than some Conservative Committee members do. In its response to the White Paper, it said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"England's longstanding problem is the long tale of underachievement with the less able".</p></blockquote>
I draw those matters to the Committee's attention because, when we look behind the crude averages for Kent and Hampshire, other facts begin to emerge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I finish my point? The GCSE results published last week show that, in 49 schools in Kent—20 of which are grant maintained—less than one in four children gained five or more GCSEs at grades A to E. Those 49 schools constitute one third of Kent's schools. That is relevant to the amendment because, where there are grammar schools, there is an impact on neighbouring schools. The structure in Kent is failing to deal with the long tail of underachievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us compare the results in Kent with those in Hampshire, where there is only comprehensive education. There are eight schools in Hampshire—about one in 10—where less than one in four children gain five GCSEs at grades A to E. Hampshire, with its comprehensive schools, is achieving better results for more children than Kent is achieving, with its mixture of grammar schools and secondary modern schools. That is why it is imperative that the Minister takes the amendment seriously and considers the impact on other schools of a variety of admission policies. I note that she does not wish me to give way to her at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dover said that Kent was doing better than authorities elsewhere and referred to his favourite authorities where he considers that standards are worse. Let us consider what is happening in Kent and examine the league tables. In six schools in Kent, the results were worse than the Ridings
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
school. At Ramsgate school, 1 per cent. of the children gained five GCSEs at grades A to E; at Woodlands high school, 4 per cent. of children gained five GCSEs; at Channel school, 4 per cent. of pupils gained five GCSEs; at Sandown Court community college—a GM school—5 per cent. of pupils gained five GCSEs; at Medway community college, 5 per cent. of pupils gained five GCSEs and 7 per cent. of pupils at Upbury Manor high school, which is also a GM school, gained five GCSEs at grades A to E. Oh, I apologise to the Committee. There are more than six schools with such pass rates—I added up the figures wrongly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Coombs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should study maths again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I probably do need to take a refresher course—but then I went to a grammar school!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At Holmesdale community school, 8 per cent. of pupils gained 5 GCSEs at grades A to E. The two members of the Committee who represent Kent and who constantly tell us how wonderfully well Kent's grammar schools are delivering for the children in Kent are letting down the very children whom they are here to represent. The structure and organisation of schooling in Kent means that the long tail of underachievement is affecting more children there than it is in Hampshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seven schools in Kent have worse results than those in Islington. There are 26 schools, nine of which are grant maintained, where the results are worse than the schools in Barking. In the lowest achieving school in Barking, 15 per cent. of pupils gained five GCSEs at grades A to E. I have more to say to members of the Committee, especially the hon. Member for Dover and you, Mr. Arnold, as I know that you are about to vacate the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[SIR MICHAEL SHERSBY 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>In discussions with education officers and members of the local authority in Barking, we are striving all the time to improve standards. Whether the discussions involve the Member of Parliament, the council or the education officers, we all recognise that the standards of achievement in Barking are not good enough for our children. We do not show the complacency of the two members of the Committee who represent Kent, where the current organisation of schooling is letting down far too many of the families that those two hon. Members represent.</p>
	<p>There are 11 schools in Kent, including four GM schools, which perform at a lower level than the lowest-performing schools in Hackney, which is Homerton House at 11 per cent. The lowest-performing school in Lambeth is Stockwell Park at 11 per cent. I do not know how many children in those 11 schools in Kent are being let down in that way. The hon. Members for Gravesham (Mr. Arnold) and for Dover are not listening—they are having another conversation. Perhaps they do not want to listen because I am telling them the facts that they should be considering before making their decision about the legislation.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
	<p>I am not attacking the children or the many committed and dedicated teachers who are trying to raise standards in those schools. It is the structure, not the schools or the children, that is letting down more children in Kent than anywhere else. The argument that somehow grammar schools assist in raising standards for more children is belied by the statistics that have been produced by the Department for Education and Employment.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has mounted a powerful case against selection and I am glad that she has done so in such detail. I was glad that she added that it was no condemnation of the children or schools involved. It shows that the method of selection applied in Kent is very detrimental to some schools. That will no doubt be refuted by Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the league tables do not tell us about the states of the schools in terms of their selectivity. My hon. Friend has mounted a powerful argument, but I should be unhappy if the individual schools that are named were to take it as a criticism of their performance by the Committee. My hon. Friend has shown that there are penalties in a selective system, which is clear from the figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. For the record, I shall reiterate the point. The basis of my argument is that I do not believe that children in Kent are any less able or less willing to achieve than children in Hampshire. Nor do I believe that teachers and head teachers in Kent are less able, qualified, committed or competent than teachers in Hampshire. The figures show that something is happening in those two authorities, leading to more children underachieving in one area than the other. The main thing that can be pointed out is that one area has a mixture of secondary modern and grammer schools while the other has a comprehensive system. Those facts must be acknowledged and, whether today or later, they must be answered. They constitute an irrefutable argument that the route down which Ministers and Conservative Members want to go will be deeply damaging and will continue the long tail of underachievement. The top kids will do all right—the children of all of us in the Room will probably do all right—but the long tail of underachievement, which is Britain's greatest problem in education, will be worsened by the proposals before us. They are retrograde; they will take us backwards, not forwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall end on this point because I know that the Committee wants to proceed. For heaven's sake, let us consider what is happening in the countries against which we must compete and which are doing better than we are. Ministers constantly cite Germany, but let us look beyond to the Pacific rim where the real competition comes from. Let us consider countries such as Japan, Taiwan and Korea. Japan does not select until the age of 14, when our children begin almost to self-select through the subjects and GCSE courses that they choose to follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is correct to say that schools in Japan do not select as such, but is she aware that there is powerful competition for children to get into particular schools? In that sense, there is a selection process, so it is not correct to say that Japan does not have selection. I myself witnessed how the system operates because I visited Japan with the Select Committee on Education and Employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to the hon. Lady's experience, but currently powerful competition arises between comprehensive schools because of the variation in standards between schools. If we really want to increase choice—we are consistently trying to get this message across—we must tackle standards in schools that are not achieving as well as others. That is the route to greater choice and diversity. The route of grammar schools and selection will damage our future; that is why countries such as Japan have not taken that route.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Later in the educational process, the French cream off people. We are discussing selection of 11-year-olds—in fact, Conservative Members are talking about selecting five-year-olds. There is not selection from the ages of 11 to 14 in the collèges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried by citing the example of two education authorities to make Ministers and Conservative Members think more deeply about how damaging and dreadful the impact of their proposals would be, and to stop them being diverted by what they perceive to be short-term political advantage. It is in that light that my hon. Friend the Member for Yardley moved the amendment, which would have some regard to the impact that selection would have on neighbouring schools. I urge the Government to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very brief. The hon. Lady's long speech is disproven by the actions of the right hon.

rightly jumped to their feet—as would the Minister—to make that clear. As they did not do so, I assume that the statistics that my hon. Friend used were accurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the hon. Member for Gravesham care to explain why the figures are so poor for some of the secondary modern schools within his county? Surely, that must be a cause of great concern because some of his constituents' children attend those schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arnold</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact, my constituents' children do not attend them. None of the schools listed by the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arnold</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am flattered, but I will make the points that I want to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is not giving way at this time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arnold</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the mathematical skills of the hon. Member for Barking are extremely weak. She compared grammar and high schools in Kent to the comprehensive system of Hampshire, but failed to say that the statistics on GCSE results that she used show that the grammar schools, which cater for more than 25 per cent. of youngsters in Kent, have clocked in with a rate of about 99 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Barking then attacked certain high schools but, if she knew anything of mathematics, she would have realised that the absence of the grammar school stream would have caused a statistical increase in number of youngsters who have not achieved the requisite number of GCSEs at those schools. Therefore, she should have compared the total outturn for the counties of Hampshire and Kent. It is significant that she did not do that. She did not consider the totality of young people in both counties or use comparative statistics. She chose instead to attack, in more than one way, individual high schools in Kent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Barking cited the case of the Ridings school. It is significant that the Secretary of State for Education and Employment had to intervene in that school, but not in a single school in Kent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Staffordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of selection is one of the matters that we are considering in this debate. The Minister of State said that he had a report on at least one school which stated that selection improved examination grades in non-selective schools. Will he supply us with a copy of that report? I should like to discover the effect on schools—whether or not there is a marked improvement in grades—because the six comprehensive secondary schools in my constituency are selective. However, those schools do not select the students—the parents select the schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schools in our community work together closely with feeder schools, bringing youngsters in and sending teachers to the feeder schools, so that they feel familiar together and grow up as a complete cohort—
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
unless their parents decide that that is not the appropriate school for them. Parents will then be able to seek entry into any secondary school in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While sitting here, I wrote out the results of my county's grant-maintained schools. On average, five GCSEs were achieved by 40.5 per cent. of pupils, which was almost up to the county standard of 40.9 per cent. I would not say that the grant-maintained schools have failed; as we all know, each school's intake has its own socio-economic mix and the school will try to maximise its student's efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what education should be about. We are talking about getting the structure right. But it is the children we should be looking after, and we should allow them the most appropriate form of education. If we are going to allow some schools to stipulate entry requirements—by some as yet to be defined selection scheme—what will be the effect on those students who are not selected?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the purpose of selection? On several occasions during previous sittings, the Minister assured us that schools will work together and do everything they can for children. However, we are creating a culture where schools will do anything to continue in existence. That will sometimes work against the educational requirements not only of existing students but also of future students. That is worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment clearly states that admission arrangements should be
	<br><blockquote><p>"appropriate to the needs of all children…in the area."</p></blockquote>
The educational needs of the children must be paramount. The very nature of what the Government seek to achieve in the Bill means that they should accept the amendment. They cannot refuse such a simple, clear and concise addition because it adds to the purpose of the Bill. I spoke about selection to all the secondary heads in my area, and they are universally against it. I have their assurance that they do not want that divisive system brought back to our area. Junior heads, too, said that they do not want it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the present time, our secondary schools are making their own arrangements. If a young person wants to do art and drama or music, they will go to Wilnecote because it now specialises in those subjects. It has built a theatre and has specialist teachers and, at 16-plus, many students are heading in that direction. We want to see specialism develop in the town, as students are entering the sixth form by subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see nothing wrong with offering all children the opportunity to maximise their abilities. Children cannot be measured at five, seven or 11 to determine their potential for life. By the time they reach 13 or 14, they can be completely changed. If that was not so, all grammar school pupils in the old system would have achieved eight O-levels; that is not how it worked. Some students found that the system was not suitable for them and were let down by selection. Others, however, unfortunately did not pass the 11-plus. I remember being on a playing field as a young lad; unike the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey), my friends did not call out, "I've passed for a secondary modern". They may have shouted out
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>185</span>
that they had passed for the grammar school, or later, for the technical college, but they did not say that they had passed for the secondary modern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to bring that system back. We want to devise a system that will offer the maximum opportunity for all youngsters to achieve their potential. That can be done through the comprehensive system. However, parents should be allowed to select the type of school that they want their children to attend to maximise their abilities, and should be able to move from school to school for the various subjects if it is necessary to follow their speciality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Government will accept the amendment because it offers choice and diversity and guarantees that the LEA, the governors and the Secretary of State will consider every child's future before implementing selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I express my appreciation for the cogent and powerful case put by my hon. Friend the Member for Barking. She used statistical data and made no personal attacks on schools, teaching staff or parents. It is disgraceful that Conservative Members seek to betray my hon. Friend's powerful, rational case for some later use in their own political defence. I know Kent rather well and, as Conservative Members have constantly complained, have visited all the various types of school in Kent—grammar, grant-maintained, local authority, primary and secondary. I have been to schools of both sorts in the constituency of the hon. Member for Gravesham. We constantly hear from Conservative Members that they strongly support both grammar and grant-maintained schools and they argue that they are somehow interchangeable. But they are not—I shall return to that. Conservative Members are strong supporters of grammar schools, but they are very much against local accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to be brief, but I should like to put on the record two paragraphs on selection from the submission of the Association of Grant-Maintained and Aided Schools on the White Paper. It says
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is is an extremely divisive issue for the GM sector. Although many of our members are former Grammar schools and some of those would like to return to their former role, the greater number are well established comprehensive schools which have been successful in raising academic standards and providing opportunity for the majority of their pupils. They would resent changes in the admission arrangements to neighbouring schools that would distort the current level playing field."</p></blockquote>
It recognises the damage that the legislation will do, which the amendment seeks to redress. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At present the distribution of selective schools is entirely accidental—those few islands, such as Buckinghamshire or parts of Kent, or a handful of London Boroughs which the tide of comprehensivisation did not cover. Great efforts have been made by Governors and Heads of the secondary modern schools in those areas to give parity of esteem but in the parental mind they will always be a second best. Naturally in areas of comprehensivisation there is a hierarchy of schools and in consequence many schools have a downward skewed ability distribution; this will be exacerbated when some schools,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
invariably the best regarded whether through their achievement or their erstwhile GS status and traditions, seek 50 per cent. selection. Raising the standards of a school with a low average ability serving an area of social deprivation has always been difficult; creating what in parental perception is a grammar school nearby will make it virtually impossible."</p></blockquote>
One has to consider those effects of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Conservative Members will make sure that their constituents and, crucially, those in the grant-maintained sector who are overwhelmingly against the establishment of more grammar schools know that the Government do not care about what those people think and that they will vote against amendments that promote wider educational interests—not in the much-maligned local authority sector, but in the very sector that they purport to support. If Conservative Members do not let their constituents know about the Government's duplicity in regard to the educational needs of children, Labour Members will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that many of the Opposition's arguments are based on a fundamental distrust of schools and their governing bodies. There seems to be a preference for centralised planning and control. The amendments undermine the principle of giving more responsibility to schools. We believe that governing bodes are best placed to assess how their schools should develop and it would be perverse to prescribe a long list of factors that governors should take into account when considering whether selection is right for their school and for the parents they serve. If anything, the amendments are a little premature because they would place barriers before governors even before they have started. The amendments seek to cramp their style. The clause merely enables the governors to say, "This is our idea", and then the next stage is to find out what everyone else thinks, not the other way round. I cannot understand why the Opposition are so frightened of the clause. Either they think that there is a great demand for selection and that schools will choose to select more, or there is no demand, in which case there will be no problem with the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me be quite clear about what the Minister is saying.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that a school and the governors of that school should have the opportunity to consider selection. That is what the clause is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Barking took us around the world. She mentioned Kent and Hampshire and then we nipped off to the Pacific rim, briefly. It is all very well taking a set of statistics and picking out one or two to prove a point. The hon. Member for South-East Staffordshire (Mr. Brian Jenkins) asked what is the effect of selection, and I can tell him and the hon. Member for Barking, who is absent, that we have an analysis of the tables. When we compare the years 1993 to 1995 and look at the England average, we see that LEA areas with selective schools improve their percentage points of 15-year-olds achieving five or more GCSEs at grades A to C by 3·3 per cent. Those areas without maintained selective schools only improved by 2·4 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May we have a copy of those figures? As a member of the Committee, I should like to see them. If the system is working, that is fine, but we need to see the report, the study and the figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not suppose that the hon. Gentleman really expects me to do his work and analyse all the tables for him. There will be a record in 	<i>Hansard</i> of today's sitting that he can consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On further analysis, we looked at the performance of schools in LEA areas with and without selective schools. In 1996, the percentage of 15-year-olds achieving five or more GCSEs at grades A to C is 44·8 per cent. in LEA areas with selective schools, compared with only 40·4 per cent. in areas without selective schools. A bigger indictment is the percentage of 15-year-olds achieving no GCSE passes. In areas with selective schools, the figure is 6·6 per cent. compared with 7·8 per cent. in areas without selective schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments will be rejected by the Government, however reasonable the Opposition think they are. They are an attempt to brainwash governors and they would increase the scope for LEAs to put pressure on schools to reach a particular conclusion. One of the main aims of the clause is to give county school governors a greater say as to whether local needs would be met more effectively through selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I therefore urge the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief; I am sorry that the Minister would not allow me to intervene. Perhaps she will be prepared to respond if she catches your eye in a moment, Sir Michael.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In her relatively brief response to what is a sensible group of amendments the Minister told us that she was concerned that they would put pressure on governors and prevent them from doing what they think right, and that they would centralise decision-making. As she is opposed to that, perhaps she will explain why clause 12 is included in the Bill—I hope that she will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
rise again to respond. Clause 12 will permit the Secretary of State, for unspecified reasons of her choosing, not to allow governors in particular areas of the country to take decisions. The Minister cannot have it both ways—if she does not like the idea of there being some form of strategic planning that takes into account the effect of one school's decision on other schools, she should tell us that she intends to propose the deletion of clause 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response to what has been an interesting and detailed debate was totally inadequate. It did not address the amendment or the arguments that have been properly and sensibly advanced. We are discussing an important matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand why the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that when a Minister describes as brainwashing an amendment that would require the needs of all children in an area to be taken into account, it shows that the Government have no interest in the vast majority of pupils and that they have regard only to the education of the few, not the many?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for having been returned to the substance of the amendments. My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The Bill is about dogmatism and ideology and not about the children of this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Barking made an excellent and powerful argument that has not been answered by the hon. Members who represent Kent constituencies, or by anyone else. In a county that we are constantly being told is a flagship for selection, school after school cannot and does not select the most able pupils and acheives results at the lowest end of the table. The statistics that my hon. Friend the Member for Barking quoted were put in the public domain by the Conservative Government. For anyone to suggest that to cite them in Committee is somehow unfair is totally improper and shows a complete lack of understanding of the information and league table system that the Government have put in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I was saying was that the hon. Member for Barking was not comparing like statistics with like. I specifically asked to her to provide the comparative statistics for all pupils in Hampshire and all pupils in Kent. She significantly failed to do that; will the hon. Member for Yardley provide them now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>189</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Barking did provide them; I will repeat them now. Perhaps the hon. Member for Gravesham was not listening. My hon. Friend said that 3 per cent. fewer pass in Kent than in Hampshire. That caused the hon. Member for Dover to stand up and say that there are reasons why that is the case. [HON. MEMBERS: "It was 2·8 per cent."] Well, 2·8 per cent. then. It does not matter whether it is 2·8 per cent. or 3 per cent. Those are the figures. If everything is averaged out, the selective system in Kent does not perform better than the system in Hampshire. That is the statistic my hon. Friend the Member for Barking quoted; the question was answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still ready to give way to the hon. Member for Dover so that he can expand on his statement about the reasons why Hampshire performs better than Kent. I hope that he was not going to cite language difficulties, social class, deprivation, urban living or any of the many factors that cause results in some Labour authorities to be lower than those in the shire counties. We have been told time and again by Conservative Committee Members that we should not cite those factors to explain underachievement. I can only conclude that the results are lower in Kent because it does not have a Labour Member of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the other statistic that is important in the comparison is that in only one in 10 schools in Hampshire the proportion of children gaining five GCSE passes at grades A to C is less than 25 per cent., whereas that proportion applies in one third of the schools in Kent? Not only the overall figure but the number of children in that tale of underachievement is greater in Kent than in Hampshire with their respective ways of organising education. We have no reason to believe that children in Hampshire are any more able than children in Kent. I reiterate that I have quite deliberately not impugned any individual school, head, teacher or child—it is the system that is causing the difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Indeed, I suspect that some of the schools in Kent have done very well, given the structure in which they have to work. She has made a powerful case in favour of the argument that a comprehensive intake can raise standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before Conservative Members decide how they will vote on the amendment, they must answer a crucial question: does the decision of a school to introduce any degree of selection affect other schools? The Under-Secretary refused more than once to answer that question, but it was answered by the hon. Member for Gravesham who said that one of the reasons why some of the secondary modern schools in Kent had lower achievements was that the grammar stream had been taken out. He also said—and I paraphrase his words here—that, given the children's ability, the results were all that could reasonably be expected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman agrees. He is saying that the decision of some schools in Kent to select had an impact on other schools. That is unanswerable. I do not care whether Conservative Members believe that the impact is good or bad, but I want them to understand that there is an impact. I am amazed that the Minister who is charged with guiding the Bill through the Committee does not seem to have even considered the question—if she has, she will not answer it. If there is indeed an impact on other schools, what is wrong with our asking the Government to take account of that impact along with all the other considerations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that the clause will be equally to the detriment of both Hampshire and Kent? We may disagree with the system in Kent and consider it less successful in educating the children as a whole than the system in Hampshire, but both authorities must have some form of strategic planning to decide what will be on offer overall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will destroy an authority's strategic planning. If schools were allowed to go their own way, it would damage not only other schools in the area but the authority as a whole. It is very much part of Conservative Members' thinking that local authorities should not have a role to play in education, because fundamental to that role is how to plan the availability of places for children throughout an entire area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that interventions should be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. He reminds us that we need strategic planning in any system. It seems strange for a Department not to want that—does it think it would put itself out of business? The amendment does not mean that schools would not be able to consider selection, that they should not consult parents or that selection should not be introduced. It would require schools to reflect and consider what the impact of their decisions will be on schools, parents, children and governing bodies. Surely in the sort of society that we wish to create, we must ask people and organisations to consider the impact of their behaviour on others who live in the same area. Their decision will have an impact on others and they should consider what that will be before reaching a conclusion. I shall press the amendment to a Division because it is so important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You, Sir Michael, have chosen to group with the lead amendment amendments Nos. 2, 59 and 58. I am not criticising that decision, but I wish to point out that there is a significant difference between amendments Nos. 1 and 2 and amendments Nos. 59 and 58. The two last amendments would make it clear—and properly so—that the result of the ballot should be made available to a much wider audience than the governors alone. For example, parents will be especially interested in what decision had been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully support amendments Nos. 59 and 58, as I believe that parents should know what decision was taken, how it was taken and who took it. However, as I have said, amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are different; they would simply deal with the broad principle so favoured by the Government—that of permissiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would agree that the governing bodies of our schools should have increased power and responsibilities. Therefore, it is right to allow governing bodies to choose how to take the decisions on whether to become selective or to increase selection which the Government will require them to take. Governing bodies should decide for themselves whether ballots should be secret or public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 59 and 58 would enable governing bodies to decide how they want to proceed with the balloting process and whether the ballot should be secret or public. My preference is for ballots to be held openly, with members of the governing body making it clear which way they vote, which is why I also support amendments Nos. 59 and 58. However, it is important to stress the significant difference between amendments Nos. 1 and 2 and amendments Nos. 59 and 58.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bath has said that as well as supporting amendments Nos. 1 and 2, which he tabled, he supports amendments Nos. 59 and 58, to which I shall refer. During the past 17 years in this country, there has been a significant transfer of powers and responsibilities from local authorities to a range of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>192</span>
other bodies. We support that process so far as it applies to local management of schools, although we are less happy about the transfer of powers to other bodies, such as development corporations. We are concerned to ensure that people—whether elected or non-elected—who exercise powers and spend public resources are accountable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Governing bodies of schools must be seen to be accountable to those who have an interest in those schools. LEAs still have representatives on governing bodies, and parents elect their representatives as do members of staff in schools. Governing bodies are representative—people are elected and appointed to them—and they are accountable to various elements which are interested in the well-being and success of the school and its pupils. Schools' governing bodies have an important function: they are responsible for public institutions and the expenditure of public money and, therefore, they must be open and accountable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On other occasions I have been highly critical of organisations, such as development corporations and hospital trusts, which meet and take decisions in secret. No one can discover which individual is responsible for taking those decisions. That is government in secret; no one is ultimately responsible to the public. I am concerned that that will happen with governing bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 2, governing bodies will be told that each year they must decide whether to increase selection, but the people who take those decisions will remain anonymous. People's votes will remain secret. As I said, and as the Minister pointed out earlier, only governors represent wider groups of people. Therefore, parents who elect school governors have a right to know how their representatives vote on that important issue. The Government believe that the issue is important—that is why they have included it in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet that important decision cannot be made openly by people whom the Government acknowledge to be representatives. How can representatives be successful if those represented do not know their actions? That is equally true of LEA and staff representatives. All those groups of people will have views about selection. Yet the people whom parents elect must make their decision in total secrecy. There will be no record of how they vote and no method of finding out. If a governing body says, "We have concluded on a secret vote of eight to seven that we should opt for selection", but everybody subsequently denies voting for it, how will anyone know the truth? The Government's proposals lack accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the Government claim to support democracy, choice, accountability and governors as representatives if they do not allow those who decide to increase selection to stand up and be counted publicly? All we want is for the votes to be recorded and available to those who are interested—parents, the LEA and governing bodies of feeder schools. People should know how their representatives voted. It is a simple principle. If the Government oppose it, they

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>193</span>
promote government in secret, and the idea of governors as representatives is dead in the water. The Government's position is indefensible. The Minister will try to defend it, but she will fail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are four amendments in this group. The first two would remove the requirement for governing bodies to vote by secret ballot, and allow them to determine the voting method. The second two would require the results of ballots to be recorded and made publicly available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will come as no surprise to the Opposition that I shall resist the amendments. Introducing or extending selection deserves proper consideration. Parents want selection; governing bodies should seriously consider how they might best respond to local demand. Requiring governing bodies to hold a free vote on the matter will focus discussion and lead to a clear decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that governors should consider selection at least once a year. Local circumstances and local opinions are not set in stone. Governing bodies—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hang on. Governing bodies clearly need to keep the issues under review, and be ready to respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that parents want selection. We may contest that, but we shall take the statement at face value. Do not parents have a right to know that their representatives voted for selection?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman calms down, I shall develop my response to the amendment and answer the question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has realised that selection can be controversial. We believe that it should be discussed sensibly. Therefore, we want governors to be able to vote freely for what they believe is best for the school, without being under pressure from colleagues or, in the case of county schools governors, LEAs that are hostile to selection. It would not be helpful to make governors' voting records publicly available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that if a parent governor—a governor elected by parents—is to represent parents, parents must know how that governor behaves? Or does she not accept that a parent governor should vote in line with the wishes of parents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that governors will know parents' wishes, but I see no reason why they should risk being individually pilloried.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Minister for giving way. I believe that many of the Bill's proposals are controversial, but I have every intention of debating them sensibly. Is the Minister telling me that the only way I can do so is if the Committee goes into secret session with no record of the way in which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>194</span>
I vote? Is she really proposing that we cannot have serious debate on controversial issues unless we do it in secret?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in the slightest. I said that it is sensible for the ballot to be secret so that no undue pressure is brought to bear on an individual. I cannot believe that the hon. Member for Bath wants to stifle the lone voice and to bring pressure to bear on one or two people who perhaps favour something that other governors do not. The hon. Gentleman has failed to read the clause because under it governors will be obliged to give an account of and explanation for their decisions in their annual reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have got the wrong end of the clause; it is about the beginning of the process. If they read on in the Bill they will see that clause 6—and schedule 1, which we have debated at length—will oblige schools and LEAs to consult where appropriate when they are considering introducing or extending selection, even when statutory proposals are not needed. I reject the arguments of Opposition Members and urge the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have often had disappointing responses from Ministers to Opposition proposals but I cannot think of another example, in my four and a half years in the House, of so disappointing and disgraceful a response from a Minister. The Minister is—I hope and believe—a democrat, someone who, or so I thought until now, believes in the importance of the democratic process. A crucial part of that process is that it be an open forum in which people choose to represent others in the full knowledge that they will be under the public gaze and accountable for their decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our school governors have an enormously difficult job, but it has been made infinitely more difficult in recent years because of the considerable pressure placed on them by Government legislation and the significant shortfall in school funding. Governors have to make extremely difficult decisions, often ones that they did not come into the job to make—between which books and equipment not to buy, for example, or which teachers to sack. They do not want to make such decisions but they get on and make them. I applaud governors, whether they are party political appointments, or whether they represent school employees or parents. I cannot think of many governors who would not agree that they do a difficult, important job and want to do it publicly so that people know that they are accountable for their decisions. I cannot think of very many governors who would want to have debates in secrecy. Even if they did, that would not be for the reasons given by the Minister. I give way to her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the board of governors to a school, whether every hon. Member declares his vote when electing the leader of his party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a public vote. I do not understand the relevance of the Minister's question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke earlier about undue pressure on minorities or an individual view. Sadly, I am in that position and represent a minority view in the Committee, but I do not feel under pressure because of it. Although we are not allowed to recognise them officially, I do not object to the fact that members of the public are allowed to come to our Committees and the Chamber to hear what I say and how I vote. I do not object from my minority position to my vote being recorded in the 	<i>Official Report.</i> I do not think that many governors would object to that either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the Minister is not prepared to accept the second two amendments in the group, she has not explained why she will not at least allow the governors themselves to decide whether the ballot should be held in secret or in public. I should have thought that the Minister would accept my amendments to allow the governors to make that decision. This is such an important issue that it must be shown clearly on the record how every individual votes. It is important to show which Conservative Members are not in favour of accountability for decisions made by governing bodies. For that reason, I shall press my amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 2, line 29, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3B) Before reaching any decision on any question arising for their consideration under subsection (2) the governing body shall have a duty to consult, by submitting proposals to the local education authority and to the governing bodies of every county, voluntary or grant-maintained school in the area.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3C) If either the local education authority or the governing bodies of the schools referred to in subsection (3B) notify their objections to the proposals, the governing body shall submit its proposals to the Secretary of State; and the Secretary of State may accept or reject the proposals in the form in which they were submitted, or may propose such variations as he thinks fit.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3D) If the local education authority and the governing bodies of all the schools referred to in subsection (3B) notify the governing body of their acceptance of the proposals, or, within a period of two months following the submission of the proposals no objections are notified, or if the Secretary of State notifies his acceptance of the proposals, the governing body shall submit the proposals to a ballot of parents, to be conducted in accordance with the provisions of sections 189 to 192 of this Act.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment has gained in importance following the vote that has just been taken. If school governors are, as the Government propose, to determine in secret whether to change admissions arrangements for their schools, wide consultation with other interested parties becomes imperative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discussed consultation earlier, the Minister of State said that he did not want the bodies that it was thought appropriate to consult to be identified in the Bill. He read out a list of bodies, which included those that I have proposed should be consulted—except for parents. I am not sure whether parents are intended to have a voice. Certainly, given the debate on the previous amendment, I am not sure whether the so-called democrats in the Conservative party believe that a ballot of parents should take place. That would probably be far too radical and democratic for them. We need to specify the relevant bodies in the Bill, because they would all have an interest in the decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that hon. Members want to make progress, so I shall give a brief account of what I propose and some of the rationale behind it. In the first instance, on a governing body's deciding—in secret, given our previous decision—that it wanted to change the admission arrangements for the school, the proposals should be submitted to the local education authority and to the governing bodies of all other schools in the area that could be affected. That is important, because, although the Government have made it apparent throughout the Committee's proceedings that they do not have a high regard for local education authorities, they have not abolished them. I await an amendment from a Conservative Member, aimed at abolishing LEAs, but I suspect that that route will not be taken
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>197</span>
because the resulting clarity of accountability would be uncomfortable for many on the Government Benches. At present, interesting attempts are constantly being made to pass the buck to LEAs for what happens in the education system for which the Government have ultimate responsibility and for which they will eventually be accountable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, not having abolished LEAs, the Government believe that they have a role. In that case, an argument can easily be made for consulting them over changes in admission arrangements. There are three aspects of that. First, LEAs are responsible for the effective use of resources. If admission arrangements in a certain school change, the popularity of one school in relation to another could be altered, a certain school could, given the Greenwich judgment, be made more popular than others, and there could therefore be an impact on the LEA's ability to deploy its resources. It is important, for that reason, that the LEA should have a say on a school's deciding to change its admission arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not return to the argument with Kent. That was made lengthily earlier on. However, I look forward to a time, when hon. Members from Kent have had time to reflect on the facts. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is a certain amount of conversation going on in the Room. I am trying to listen to the hon. Lady's speech on this important amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Michael. I also look for a response based on the facts from the two members of the Committee who represent Kent constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bromley is an interesting example of the sort of chaos that can ensue if all schools in an area become selective. Most schools in Bromley have opted out. Once one school had decided to become selective, the other schools, who feared what might happen to their intake, all became selective. All children in Bromley and the surrounding area now have to sit the selective exam. I do not know whether the Funding Agency for Schools is footing that bill, but I gather that the schools have been given some money for the purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some schools have chosen to advertise in the 	<i>Evening Standard.</i> It is now predicted that as many as 100 11-year-olds will not know by the end of the summer term which secondary school they will attend at the beginning of the autumn term. All parents with children of that age will know how desperately distressing and disturbing that can be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The move from primary to secondary school is in itself traumatic for many children. If there are insufficient places in the LEA schools and if children have to wait to be allocated a place during the summer holiday, parents will not be able to buy school uniforms and the children will not be able to meet their potential friends. That and the many other important things that ensure stability and ease in the transition from primary to secondary school will be affected as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>198</span>
Those are key matters. We are talking about children and if the LEA is not consulted on whether a particular school should change its selection criteria the children will not be served well. That is one reason why LEAs should be consulted. I shall mention one other. I have already talked about the effective use of resources and the proper planning for places. If the Government wish to abolish LEAs, they should say so openly; otherwise, the LEAs should fulfil the roles that the Government give them, use their money properly and plan effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Children with special educational needs may also be affected by a school changing its admission criteria. The LEA has a duty to place such children in an appropriate school with appropriate resources. If the LEA is not consulted when a school changes its admission policy, the LEA cannot fulfil the function given it under statute by the Government. For those three reasons, it is important that the LEAs should be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest also that a school's governing body should be consulted. We have put that argument throughout our discourse. Most education authorities, including the Kent and Bromley LEAs, will find that what happens in one school has an impact on other schools. What happens in the secondary sector will have an impact on the primary sector and what happens in the primary sector will affect the secondary sector. Consultation is important. Those are the provisions of the first part of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the amendment deals with disagreements between those bodies that have been consulted and the school that is proposing to change its admissions arrangements. Where there is not a local consensus, the matter should be referred to the Secretary of State. That is a commonsense proposal, and I have no doubt that were the Secretary of State by any chance to be a Conservative, he or she would enable the school concerned to introduce selection. Such powers of intervention are used in other instances; there is no reason why there should not be a proper arbitrator in this instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third part of the amendment ought also to help the Government, because it is sensible and practical. We need a time frame for decisions. I want to reassure the Minister; the amendment has been tabled not to delay matters but to ensure proper open consultation with all interested parties. The third part of the amendment would provide that if, after a period of two months, there has been no response from either of the bodies that ought to be consulted on a proposal to change admission arrangements, that lack of response would be taken to represent a consensus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would seem appropriate at that point to undertake exactly the same procedures that currently apply to proposals for schools to become grant maintained: to ask the parents of pupils at the school. There may be a question whether it should be the parents of pupils at the school or the parents of prospective pupils who are consulted, but why should we not ask parents whether they want the character of the school to be altered by a change in admission arrangements?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>199</span>
That must appear sensible to essential democrats—as Members of the House must all be. It would fit appropriately with the structure of provision for grant-maintained status, and is particularly important given the Government's keenness for the original governors' decision to be taken in secret. The amendment would open up the process and ensure that parties that undoubtedly have an interest are sensibly consulted, and that parents have real choice and a part in deciding whether to change the nature of a school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will come as no surprise to the hon. Lady that I urge the Committee to reject the amendment in all its parts. It is obvious that if it were adopted and its provisions added to clause 2, we would give governors consultation constipation. If the amendment were accepted, before a governing body took so much as an initial decision to consider selection, the governors would have to submit proposals to the LEA and every county, voluntary or grant-maintained school. If any of those bodies objected to the proposals, the governing body would have to submit the proposals to the Secretary of State. That is bureaucracy gone mad, and it puts the cart before the horse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause concerns a governing body's consideration of whether to begin the process of varying a school's admission arrangements by introducing or extending selection. If the governing body concludes in principle that the introduction or extension of selection would benefit the school and the parents that it serves, there is then a second stage. As the hon. Lady knows, other clauses relate to consultation, notification and the publication of statutory proposals where necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Governing bodies already have a good idea of what local parents want. Parents can make their views on selection known to them at any time, and governors will take those views into account during the annual consideration; parents are, of course, also represented on governing bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, before any significant selection can be introduced, either statutory proposals must be published or, under the Bill, local consultation will be required. In either case, the views of parents will be important and be sought by the school. Some governing bodies may choose to ballot parents, but that should not be a requirement, any more than it is where other admission changes are concerned. Where statutory proposals are required, the Secretary of State would obviously look very carefully at all the representations that she received from local parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Governors are best placed initially to consider whether the introduction of selection would better serve their local community. Those decisions should not be subject to the influence or delaying tactics of any other outside body, which may want to undermine the process at an early stage. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to come back on a couple of points. In her response, the Minister demonstrated the Government's complete lack of consistency. She
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>200</span>
described our proposals as "bureaucracy gone mad", but her description applies rather to nursery vouchers—that is where bureaucracy has gone completely stark, staring bonkers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are suggesting a sensible degree of consultation with those parties, not least parents, who will be affected. As to consultation constipation, let us ask parents whether they want a change in the school's admission policy—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a stage for that, but, when considering GM schools, Ministers accepted that there was a need to specify in legislation the need for a ballot of parents. Perhaps it was because democracy did not work in the way that Ministers wanted that they have now decided that they do not want democracy in this Bill—perhaps that is what motivates Ministers. If democracy was good enough for the proposals on GM status, why is it not good enough for the proposals that we are discussing, which are far more important and will have a greater impact on a wider range of schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady thinks about it, she will agree that, when decisions have to be made about whether a school should become grant maintained, the parents of children at the school are balloted because they are the people who will be affected. In the case that we are discussing, parents with children at the school are less likely to have a direct interest in the introduction of selection than those parents whose children will apply for a place in the future. There is no easy read-across from the GM sector into the schools that we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fascinating contribution. Labour Members have consistently argued that not only existing parents but future parents have an interest in whether a school becomes grant maintained. I cannot understand the distinction that is suddenly being made between a decision on admission arrangements and a decision on GM status. Logic is not on the Minister's side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has suddenly clicked: the Government do not want to ballot parents because, when they asked parents about GM status, too many said no—too many thought that it was a lousy idea. The Government know, as we know, that most parents recognise that selection is a lousy idea, so they are frightened of asking parents. They hope that the party politically placed people on governing bodies will influence the decision in favour of greater selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the Minister's response, I feel that I have no option but to press the amendment, which is a sensible and practical proposal, to a Division. I watch with interest whether Ministers will vote against democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>RELAXATION OF CONTROLS ON ENLARGEMENT OF PREMISES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, amendment No. 113, in page 3, line 5, after "259A.—(1)", insert—

	<p>No. 115, in page 3, line 7, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4A) The Secretary of State may by order designate for the purposes of this section any area in England and Wales specified in the order (whether conterminous with the area of any local education authority or not).</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(4B) Where an area is so designated, then in relation to any grant-maintained school in that area, section 259 shall apply".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On clauses 1 and 2, we discussed issues dear to the hearts of Opposition Members which took up a good deal of time. Clause 3 also relates to matters that will exercise us a great deal and, we hope, lead for sound reasons to some sort of compromise from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of amendments would give the Secretary of State a reserve power in respect of the expansion of grant-maintained schools analogous to her powers in clause 12 in respect of grant-maintained selection, under which she has the power to limit selection to 20 per cent. Under the amendment, she would have the power to disapply the exemption from the usual publication procedures for reasons obvious to anyone who takes an interest in wider education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the supply of school places is to expand uncontrollably without regard to the needs of localities—and regardless of demand and the potential for destabilising other sound schools in the area—the Secretary of State must have at least a reserve power to intervene if necessary. The Minister may argue that the market will regulate matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Something like that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says from a sedentary position that he would say something like that. I await his contribution with interest. The Government would be the first to highlight the causes of waste and inefficiency in local government; it is their constant refrain. We argue that this unregulated approach to the provision of school places will lead to waste in the system and boost unit costs as well as overall costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to put the figures on record. The Department for Education and Employment estimates that the current figure for unfilled places in the system is approximately 883,000. That is 12 per cent. of total designated capacity—a lot of school places.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the number of surplus places is large, but in the contexts of school size, flexibility and choice, does not there have to be some surplus in each local education authority area so that parents can make a choice? I do not denigrate the amendment, but we need some bounds on what surplus places are or are not acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. The future Labour Government will, of course, take regard of the need for flexibility in the system while recognising the huge amout of inefficiency and waste that suplus places cause. When Mark Carlisle was a Conservative Secretary of State for Education and Science, he said that schools do not have elastic sides. One cannot just cram people into them. A degree of planning is required, althougth that is anathema to Conservative Members. I can see the Minister shaking his head

vigorously; perhaps his Parliamentary Private Secretary, the hon. Member for Finchley (Mr Booth), is pulling his strings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's figures take no account of the number of overcrowded schools, another point that we have to remember. Although there are surplus places and schools that are undersubscribed, there are also schools that are packed to the gunnels. We require flexibility, but also planning and co-ordination to make sure that the best educational deal possible is given to children in those schools. The figures do not take account of the 336 grant-maintained schools in stage 1 local education authority areas where fewer than 30 per cent. of pupils are in grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has rightly raised concerns about the impact on surplus places, but what consideration has he given to the impact that the provision may have on the education system's

capital programme? Many schools are crumbling. Does the hon. Gentleman think it appropriate that money should be spent on additional premises to allow schools to expand when it might be better spent on repairing derelict school buildings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have to find the most efficient employment for available capital. I paid a visit not long ago to the maligned district of Calderdale. I went not to the the Ridings school, but to Sowerby Bridge high school. The top floor of the school is falling apart and it cannot have the money to make necessary repairs, but it has 13 demountable classrooms with all the extra costs that implies from heating loss and other things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
