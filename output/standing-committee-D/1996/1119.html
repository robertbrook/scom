Surely there should by the right to consultation.

	<time>Tuesday 19 November 1996</time>
	<p>[SIR MICHAEL SHERSBY 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Education Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during the proceedings on the Education Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
In doing so, may I on behalf of the Committee welcome you, Sir Michael, to the Chair. Committee proceedings are usually happy occasions but for whoever is in the Chair, they are difficult and testing times. I am sure that members of the Committee will not want to make our forthcoming proceedings difficult for you and the fact that your enormous experience, wisdom, fairness and firmness will be guiding us throughout means that, in all probability, we shall have a productive Committee stage. I also welcome Mr. O'Hara as your substitute Chairman, Sir Michael, who I am sure will guide us with equal firmness and sagacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that several veterans of the Committee that discussed the Education Act 1993 are members of this Committee. I played a small part in those discussions, as did my hon. Friends the Members for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs), for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Evennett) and for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr Pawsey) who, I suspect, has been a member of every Education Bill Committee since 1979—and who does not look any the worse for that! Furthermore, the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) has probably been a member of Education Bill Committees since 1992. The hon. Members for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) and for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris) have also been members of such Committees. Some of the usual suspects are here and I should not be at all surprised if we make our usual speeches too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motion provides for the Committee to follow the usual sitting pattern if that becomes necessary. However, it allows us flexibility to determine when we shall sit. I believe that it will be possible for us to do justice to the Bill by arranging flexible sittings that are agreed by all members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Kilfoyle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Walton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of Opposition Members, I welcome you, Sir Michael, to the Chair as I do Mr. O'Hara. I agree with the Minister that the reputation of your sagacity certainly precedes you. Mr. O'Hara will be a delightful substitute for you. I presided over his original selection as a parliamentary candidate and the main argument at that time was over which of the two candidates spoke the most languages. Mr. O'Hara won by two, and the fact that he can speak eight languages endeared him greatly to the electors of Knowsley,
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
South. I welcome Conservative Members who were members of the Committee that discussed the 1993 Education Bill, including the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth who is described in less polite circles as "flogger". I do not know why, but I understand that we shall discuss an amendment that he has tabled later in our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the importance of time in relation to the Bill. It contains many varied and important issues. We shall be considering a Bill of two halves, the first of which deals principally with selection and the extension of grant-maintained schools. The second half deals with issues that have been flagged up repeatedly by the Opposition, and we are pleased that the Government have decided to adopt many of those proposals. I am sure that we shall tease them out, and say whether a future Labour Government would find them acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as we can conceivably manage it, we intend to be constructive and pragmatic. Nevertheless, time is of the essence. I understand the Government's sense of urgency, but we must try to ensure full discussion of the various parts of the Bill—the contentious and the less contentious parts—and to balance the time given to them, in order to give the Bill our full consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, we have long stood against the principle of selection. We shall go into this in some detail when debating the various amendments, but we believe that selection is wrong in principle and that the outcome of selection is not in the broader educational interests of our children or in the national economic interest. Some of the national testing results to be announced this week and the forthcoming GCSE results and league tables will show that slection is not the answer to the country's needs—neither in terms of economic prosperity nor in terms of social cohesion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the publication on Thursday of the report of the Office for Standards in Education into exclusions from schools, and to all that it will imply. The extension of grant-maintained status, too, will require much debate. We would naturally argue that although about 1,100 schools have already opted for that status, about 23,000 maintained schools—the overwhelming majority—have not opted for grant-maintained status and that there is, therefore, no public demand for its extension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall also need time to argue our case that some of the provisions governing grant-maintained schools will have a deleterious effect on the plans of local education authorities to ensure the appropriate provision of schools in their areas. If there is sufficient time, we shall argue that we need to explore the proposals in depth, particularly the definition in clause 7 of those grant-maintained schools requiring special measures. The Government will need fully to explain what they intend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we go further through the Bill, we shall come to provisions dealing with the impact of equal opportunities legislation. I am mindful of the celebrated case involving my son's school, the Liverpool Bluecoat school. The school faced great difficulties—rather, the Secretary of State faced great difficulties—when considering whether it could
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
become selective because there were insufficient places for girls in the local education authority area. That is an important point because, given time, the paradox of the increasing disparity in performance between girls and boys will become evident. We will argue that there are sound ways in which that can be tackled, following on from policies that we will advocate during the course of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Probably the most acrimonious subject, given the firm commitment of the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth to flogging and caning youngsters—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really must correct the hon. Gentleman. At no time has anyone implied that flogging should take place. The hon. Gentleman misrepresents my case. All that I have said is that in those cases where exclusion is an option, caning on the hand should take place. As an alternative to exclusion, the cane should be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee has got off to an extremely good start, but we are debating the sittings motion; we should confine ourselves to that and not get drawn into the Bill's provisions, as we have much business before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your guidance, Sir Michael. What I am saying is that there are so many contentious issues that it is important for the Committee to consider the amount of time allowed under the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth said, there will be much argument about the new clause that he has tabled. I shall not go into the debate on discipline, but we shall require time to consider fully some of the issues raised by that new clause. For example, who will deliver the punishment? Will all teachers in a given school be required to deliver punishment? Will there be punishment teachers? Will such teachers be selected because of their sadistic approach to the rearing of children by hand?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the sittings motion allow us enough time to consider what form the punishment will take? What will be the instrument of delivery: a slipper, a cane, a tawse, or a strap? If we have sufficient time, I hope that we can explore which part of the anatomy the punishment will be delivered on. Has the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth considered those questions and the amount of time that will be required to examine fully the implications of his ill-thought-out new clause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we have sufficient time, we shall also explore the question of exclusions, particularly in light of the Ofsted report to be issued on Thursday which, I understand, will be placed in the Library. The report has been available to Ministers for some time but, for reasons best known to the Minister, it was not made available to other Members—I tabled a question requesting a copy. We shall need to digest the report's implications fully; exclusion is such a huge problem that we shall need time to consider why 13,000 youngsters are excluded every year and whether there are reasons for that other than purely disciplinary matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
We need also to examine the nature of those disciplinary matters. It is one thing for children to be excluded for violent activity, but it is another for them to be excluded for not subscribing to a dress code, for example, or because they are late for school or—dare I say it—because they have a special educational need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I remind the hon. Gentleman that we are discussing a motion that relates directly to the days and times on which the Committee should meet? The hon. Gentleman wants time to be made available for consideration of all those important matters; I believe that time can and will be made available, but I suggest that he be kind enough to direct his remarks entirely to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected, Sir Michael. What I am trying to point out is that some Committee members may take the view that we do not have sufficient time to discuss the many and varied issues, whereas others may argue that we have too much time. I am attempting to take the Committee through some of the issues that will need full and rigorous examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the Committee will consider baseline assessment. I hope that the sittings motion will allow us sufficient time to examine rigorously the experiences of Labour authorities such as Birmingham, which has promoted baseline assessment, and the proposals in the Labour publication "Excellence for Everyone", which also promoted baseline assessment. If we have sufficient time, I hope we can consider value added assessment and what baseline assessment means in terms of league tables. Some league tables will be published tomorrow, but they should relate to what a school does, rather than provide a snapshot of academic achievement that may be based on pupils who have been selected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be areas on which we will save time—the sittings motion may cater for that. When we discuss the merger of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications with the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, I am sure that we can save the Government a bit of time by our ready agreement to that merger—given appropriate safeguards. But then again, having saved time on that issue, we may have a fairly long debate about inspection and assessment of local education authorities. We should have a rigorous and full debate on that issue; we proposed such inspections two years ago, but debating their form may cost us a little time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider whether there will be sufficient time under the sittings motion to deal with the financial implications as well as the educational implications of the Bill. Whether we have the proposed sittings motion, one that extends the time available for debate or one that diminishes that time, the Government will have great difficulty implementing their proposals. Nevertheless, it is essential that we consider all the implications of the many and varied proposals in the Bill.

	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
If I may briefly repeat myself, Sir Michael, we view the early parts of the Bill as the most contentious. I am in little or no doubt that the first four parts of the Bill will take up a substantial amount of the time allocated under the sittings motion. The second half of the Bill is not so contentious, but we will still require probing amendments and rigorous scrutiny if we are to ensure that the items contained therein—which have been lifted directly from Labour party policy papers—are implemented in a way that addresses the educational needs of our children, and are not just as a belated recognition by the Government that the main thrust of educational debate ought to concern the promotion of standards rather than structures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to my final point. I am extremely concerned that we may be hamstrung in our debate under the sittings motion if the Government insist on placing undue emphasis on structures under the first four parts of the Bill. If they were to accept some of the reasonable amendments already tabled by the Opposition and further amendments that are to come, we could save a considerable amount of the Committee's time and begin to consider the important issues raised in the final six parts of the Bill, which deal with the principle of raising educational standards for all our children throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also hope that we will not lose time—and therefore have insufficient time—by wasting overmuch thought and effort on what I consider to be frivolous amendments, such as the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. I do not believe that the new clause is supported by the Minister of State; it is certainly not supported by the Prime Minister. It does appear to be supported by the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan). Once again, the Government are completely split on an issue, and we can help the Government on that issue by being our usual reasonable and moderate selves, if we are given sufficient time under the sittings motion to debate it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join other hon. Members in welcoming you and your colleague, Mr. O'Hara, to the Chair, Sir Michael. I am sure that you will give us wise guidance, of which, as many of the usual suspects will be aware, I need a considerable amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the Minister, I am also delighted to see around me several hon. Members who have served with me on other education Committees. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth has left his place, but he is somewhere within the precincts and I would like to deny the allegations of a special relationship between us. You have already had experience, Sir Michael, of the extremely wise words of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) and you will come to cherish them over the coming weeks and months; on this occasion, however, he made no reference to the issue that occupied so much of our last Committee experience together: black holes. No doubt it will be raised in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should be aware that the Bill does not fill black holes, not just those on which the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) is an expert—intergalactic black holes—but the 200 black holes in nursery education provision around the country which were noted by the Pre-School Learning Alliance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the comments of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton; I often act as his straight man.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that the hon. Gentleman made was important, but I would like to make it clearer. The Committee will find it difficult to decide whether to accept the sittings motion because it poses a problem: do we need the proposed amount of sittings, or considerably more? Several factors could allow us to have considerably fewer, so I hope that the Minister will respond to the Committee before we decide on the motion. The Minister could do two things, in this sitting, that would enable us to reject the sittings motion and sit far less frequently. First, he could acknowledge that both sides of the Committee agree broadly on the principles of many parts of the Bill: on baseline assessment, on the amalgamation of the National Council for Vocational Qualifications and the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, on the inspection of LEAs, on school discipline—notwithstanding the disagreement that the Committee will doubtless have with the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth on that issue—and on careers education and guidance. If the Minister agreed to explain as soon as possible the detailed working of those issues, so that we could have some indication of what might be included in guidance notes, for example, the Committee could proceed quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. Having followed the hon. Gentleman's argument as closely as I always try to do, it seems—and perhaps you will confirm that, Sir Michael—that it would not be in order to me to respond to his seductive invitation to go into detailed arguments while we are debating the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would prefer members of the Committee to direct their comments to the sittings motion, which seems eminently clear and which provides plenty of opportunity for flexibility, good will and the expeditious dispatch of the business before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that you would give us wise guidance, Sir Michael, and you are already demonstrating that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not making the point that the Minister should provide that information now, but that he should agree to provide such information during our subsequent debates so that we could make quick progress and not need to meet, for example, on Thursdays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I said that the Minister would have to do two things for us to agree that there was no need to meet as frequently as proposed in the sittings motion. The second matter is the most crucial: the Minister must tell the Committee—either now, or perhaps after
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
some consideration—whether the Government are prepared to drop the first parts of the Bill. He will be well aware that there is little support in the Committee or in the country for the parts of the Bill on increased selection and the development of grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put the hon. Gentleman out of his apparent agony? It would be, to say the least, somewhat unorthodox if, having had a Second Reading, the Government were to announce within the first few minutes of a Committee sitting that they were dropping some of the substantial parts of a Bill. I do not propose to depart from the long-honoured and established traditions of the House. As the Bill has had a Second Reading, I would expect the Committee to debate it as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You, Sir Michael, would hardly blame me for trying because I am sure that all members of the Committee would have been delighted if the Minister had given a rather different response. Given the Minister's intervention, we must reflect even more carefully on the sittings motion. If he is adamant that selection and the development of grant-maintained status are to form a major part of our debates, the Committee must consider whether sufficient time is being allowed to enable us to consider the complex issues that he wants us to debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not set a precedent if the Government were to recognise that part of a Bill was wrong even after Second Reading. Indeed, only this year, the Government withdrew eight clauses of the Housing Act 1996 in Committee after it had had a Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving evidence of that precedent. No doubt the Minister would like to consider the fact that some of his ministerial colleagues have been prepared to make such changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I give a second example? Around this time last year, we and the Minister spent some weeks debating the Education (Student Loans) Act 1996, which the Government have now completely abandoned. That whole Act—not just a clause—has no effect now, so our time was completely wasted. The Minister should take that on board, and he should realise that some clauses in the Bill would be equally worthless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that second example. No doubt other members of the Committee could give further examples. Clearly, it is perfectly possible for the Minister to take on board the responses that he receives from all sorts of quarters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that the Bill came out of the Government's own White Paper, which included, for example, a proposal for a mandatory increase in the delegation from local education authorities to schools to 95 per cent. The White Paper went out for consultation but, as the hon. Member for Walton rightly pointed out, only in the past 24 hours have we had an opportunity to see the responses to that. But in
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
those 24 hours, we have ascertained that there were 637 responses. Two thirds of the responses were opposed to the increase of delegation to 95 per cent. In the light of that opposition, the Government dropped that proposition and it is not in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surprisingly, in the same consultation on the White Paper, there was equally severe criticism of the Government's proposal on selection, yet sadly, despite that opposition, that provision has remained in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong our discussion or get into substantive debate at this stage, but in response to the hon. Gentleman's point, there is a distinction between mandating an extension of delegation—as would have been the case had we legislated for that—and a permissive arrangement, such as in the Bill, to enable selection to proceed if there is sufficient parental or other support for it. I think that on reflection, the hon. Gentleman will see that there is an important distinction. That explains what he has stumbled on as a rather dramatic difference of approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's point, and perhaps I would be ruled out of order, Sir Michael, if I were to pursue that argument, but there are similar confusions in the Bill and we shall have to spend time teasing them out from the Minister. The Bill proposes that schools will be able to make significant changes of character without consultation in their local communities, without the involvement of the local education authority and with the removal of the current statutory regulations that require them to publish notices and to submit their proposals to the Secretary of State for decision. Hidden away in clause 12, the Secretary of State will retain reserve powers to intervene in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will want to tease out from the Minister after considerable debate, I suspect, the difference between open publication of notices, when the public have a right to express their views on which the Secretary of State then decides, and the proposition in clause 12, which is not the free-for-all that the Government have led us to believe they are proposing. They are introducing reserve powers so that as and when the Secretary of State chooses, for whatever reasons are apparent to her, she may intervene to block any significant change of character by an individual school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is those sorts of differences of nuance that will require considerable debate in Committee unless we hear at an early stage that on mature reflection, taking into account the examples given by hon. Members, the Minister agrees to drop the first part of the Bill. I know that many people in the country wish the Minister would do that. He knows that there is no desire among the public or those working in education to see an expansion of grant-maintained status or selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not before had the pleasure of sitting in a Committee under your sagacious leadership, Sir Michael. Clearly, the serious deficiencies in my experience in the House will be put right in the next few weeks. I am rather more familiar with your co-Chairman Mr. O'Hara, as he and I sit on the Select Committee on Education and Employment. On occasion, we have travelled together to all sorts of exotic parts of the world. We have been to Tower Hamlets, Stoke-on-Trent, Everton, Bristol and today, we are going to Norfolk, the Secretary of State's constituency. We shall be considering the work on the Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained Schools Bill, in which I had the pleasure to participate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our debates, I shall reflect on the differences of approach between the Select Committee and the Standing Committee, and on the various things that members of the Select Committee learned on our passage around not only the country, but the world. The Select Committee looks carefully at legislation, but also listens carefully to people who have knowledge and experience before making its recommendations. I often observe in Standing Committees that despite the Opposition's genuine desire to table reasoned amendments, they are seldom—in fact, never—passed; the Minister occasionally takes one away for reflection, that is all. I hope that the Minister will look carefully at the Opposition's reasoned amendments during the passage of this Bill. Committee sittings generally allow the Opposition to propose amendments and Government Members to do their post; as we are moving into the festive season, I am sure that we will see—as we saw during the passage of the Education Act 1993—hon. Members using the time productively to complete their Christmas cards. It will, of course, be the last time that some Conservative Members will do that; others who are returned after the election may be sitting on the Opposition Benches, in which case they will have to watch us filling in our Christmas cards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall table probing amendments and I am sure that we shall see the clear blue water that the Government so desire appearing between the two sides of the Committee. I look forward to the interesting amendments that the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth—who is again leaving the Room—will table; I am sure that he will demand the smack of firm government. My hon. Friend the Member for Walton said that the proceedings could expose not so much the blue water between the Government and the Opposition as the muddy water than exists between Conservative Members. I was fascinated to hear the intervention of the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth on my hon. Friend; we shall clearly have choice and diversity in spanking. I look forward to receiving the benefit of the hon. Gentleman's considerable knowledge of such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Minister is present, although his usual sartorial splendour has diminished; that may be due to his switch of constituency. He is now displaying to the Committee the splendour of his tie and watch-chain. I look forward to seeing the superb waistcoat that he wore during the passage of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Education Act 1993. He said that he had heard many of the speeches before; I have done some research in books from the shelves of my office and I assure him that he will hear some of the arguments that he heard last time. I am also pleased that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Lady Olga Maitland) is present; I have not only served on Committees with her, including the Education Select Committee, but we have each served on the Committee stage of Bills that the other has promoted. I look forward to her radiant eloquence, which will fill the air of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that we shall debate the White Paper from which the Bill sprang and examine the main objective that the Government set out in it—to raise standards in schools. If that is the purpose of the legislation, I hope that both sides of the Committee will agree with it. However, I suspect that it is not. The Opposition want opportunities for all, not escape routes for a few. We shall therefore, disagree with many of the measures in the early parts of the Bill. We shall also apply other tests during our consideration of the Bill. Will it advance choice for children of all ages and abilities and promote the interests of children with special needs, or will diversity give opportunity only to a few and deny it to the many? We shall also consider whether the proposals are workable and whether the Government have consulted widely on them. Those are sensible acid tests which we shall apply to the Bill and the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall also consider the fact that the ink on the Education Act 1996 is barely dry, and yet each of the first 31 clauses of the Bill is some sort of amendment to or alteration of that Act, which was only considered earlier this year. I am sure that the Minister will tell us what went wrong with that Act and how the Government got it so wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has already been pointed out, the first part of the Bill concerns the return to grammar schools and selection, which has been rejected by parents up and down Britain. The Minister mentioned the Education Act 1993, which gave parents and governors the opportunity to make grant-maintained schools selective. It is interesting how few grant-maintained schools have chosen to go down that route; it is not a popular option with parents. We are returning to a system that chooses the few and discards the many—a system that fails children at 11-plus, so that they carry out a self-fulfilling prophecy throughout their educational lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall have an opportunity to consider the matter of selection, especially in small rural towns—this may be of more interest to Conservative than to Opposition Members of the Committee because they more often represent such areas. Such towns may have only one secondary school, which may be a community college or a large comprehensive school. Some small villages may have only one primary school. I shall be interested during our sittings to hear how Conservative members of the Committee would react if a local comprehensive school in a town detached and remote from other towns in the area decided to select 20 per cent. of its intake, and what would happen to the children who were not selected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying into the substance of the Bill. This morning, we are discussing the sittings motion. My job as Chairman of the Committee is to ensure that every member of the Committee has the opportunity to have his or her say and is able fully to debate the clauses, and to ensure that the Bill is reported to the House in due course. It would be helpful to our having the time to debate the Bill that the hon. Gentleman wants if he were to bring his remarks to a conclusion and allow us to get on with that business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Michael. I am deeply grateful for your guidance and I shall, of course, be instructed by it. I was just trying to mention some of the matters that I hope the sittings motion will give us time to explore, and saying that I look forward to Conservative members of the Committee telling us their views about selection in towns and villages in their constituencies, which may seriously disadvantage children in their areas. I also wondered whether they would let us know whether they have discussed that matter with their constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other issue that I hope that we shall have time to discuss is the massive democratic deficiency that now exists because of legislation passed in recent years, and in particular the fact that grant-maintained schools are controlled by the Funding Agency for Schools in York, and that local governing bodies are now little more than self-perpetuating oligarchies. I trust that during our debates on that particular subject, these matters will be discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support comprehensive education. We are certainly opposed to bringing back selection, which has been rejected by parents. I trust, Sir Michael, that during the course of the Bill, we shall have time to discuss and air those matters most fully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Sir Michael. "Sagacious" is rather a long word for me, but I am sure that you will be wise and fair. I have absolutely no doubt that we shall learn quite a lot about discipline from your chairmanship, which will inform our discussion of the subject and some of the questions that may arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer first to the question of having already been a Second Reading and Committee consideration of some items in this Bill; that in itself shows that the Government are clear about the direction in which they wish to move. I am talking about the Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained Schools Act 1996, which provides for nursery vouchers. That Act may have become law simply because there were insufficient Committee sittings to enable us to discuss some of the implications of making nursery vouchers available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence from the four pilot authority nursery schemes shows that the Government's intention with that Act has not been fulfilled. I shall give one example. The Government had hoped that nursery vouchers would increase the number of private and voluntary places in the pilot areas. This afternoon and tomorrow, members of the Select Committee on
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Education and Employment are to visit Norfolk, where there is evidence that six private and voluntary nurseries have closed. That suggests that a sufficient number of sittings is needed to ensure that we do not pass into law provisions that we shall repent of at our leisure—probably once the Conservatives are in opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second subject on which the Committee should be allowed sufficient time is the reintroduction of selection at the age of 11. I had always thought—as a new Member, I was surprised to see it—that the consensus on comprehensive education had been pretty solid across both parties for a long time. The Secretary of State for Education and Employment, when she was a member of Norfolk county council, took an active role in ensuring that every grammar school in the county was closed. She believed that comprehensive education was the best way in which to raise standards for all children. When Baroness Thatcher was Secretary of State for Education and Science, she was responsible for the closure of more grammar schools than any other Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that consensus has broken down, which is what is suggested by part I of the Bill, we must have a proper and lengthy debate on the implications. Members of both parties speak of wanting to raise standards and of wanting opportunities for all in education—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Three parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My sincere apologies. I mean three political parties—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]—and more. We all speak of wanting to raise standards and of wanting opportunity for all in education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the hon. Lady's remarks about her desire to increase standards, will she tell the Committee about Islington education authority's record under her leadership?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would be very unhappy if the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) were to be diverted into such territories. I know that, given her long experience of local government, she is aware of how important it is for Committees to have time to discuss the real issues. I hope, therefore, that she will help the Committee to get on to that business as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will indeed, Sir Michael, but I am always astounded by the fact that although the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam is a resident of Islington, she has never used an Islington school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that because the consensus on how we ensure equality of opportunity and high standards of education for all our children has broken down, we require a sufficient number of sittings to ensure that we are taking a step that will meet the objectives that we claim to share across the political spectrum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Issues arise almost daily that will be important in our consideration of the Bill. Yesterday, for example, the results of the seven, 11 and 14-year-old tests were published. Although they showed some improvement from last year, they demonstrated that there are many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0108">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
young people who are not obtaining the necessary basic skills through their schooling to enable them to fulfil their potential both in school and, later in life, in their jobs. When we come to discuss standards, I hope that we shall have time to debate the worrying science results; although the tests have changed, there was a drop in the number of children who reached the expected level of attainment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt further reports and statistics will arise—I welcome that, as I believe that information is an important mechanism for raising standards and improving our schools—but they will affect our consideration of the Bill and we should take that into account in deciding whether we should agree to the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were issues in the White Paper on which there would have been consensus, but which have been omitted from the Bill. That causes me some concern. I draw attention, for example, to the delegation of budgets, which I believed was to be incorporated into the Bill; I fail to understand why it was not. We would have supported an increased delegation of budgets, although we would have been concerned about how access to high-quality education for children with special educational needs would have been protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has revealed to the Committee something that people were not aware of. I am surprised that she says that she might have joined only the one third of respondents to the White Paper who favoured increased delegation. Surely the need for some high-quality centrally provided services—such as those for children with special educational needs, which the hon. Lady herself mentioned—is one of the key reasons why the Government sensibly dropped the proposal, and I congratulate the Minister on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have said in our own document that we want delegation of budgets to schools to be increased to 90 per cent.—that is one of our commitments. We might have been able to discuss the extent to which the delegation of budgets should be increased and how, if delegation were increased, we could protect the additional costs that arise because children with special educational needs must be educated. It is throwing in the towel to say that we cannot discuss the matter simply because of children with special educational needs. The other issues can be dealt with. We shall not have the increased delegation of budgets to schools; on the whole, they should run themselves. They are probably better than a rather more distant force at determining how they spend their money. We would have welcomed a debate on the issues arising from that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mrs. Cheryl Gillan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Grant-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, one of the reasons why grant-maintained schools have become irrelevant is that the local management of schools has given the free delegation of budgets to all schools. It is, therefore,
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
unnecessary to complicate the structure and create division within communities. It would have been a welcome debate and we should tackle the difficult issue of the delegation of budgets rather than making excuses for not enabling schools to make wise use of the money that is delegated to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Bath that there are some matters in the Bill on which there is broad consensus. In fact, many of them were our ideas. Several Labour-controlled local authorities are making solid progress on the ground on furthering, for example, the baseline assessment, the development of home-school agreements and several policies that have been suggested with regard to discipline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a sad reflection on the Government's real commitment to raising standards and ensuring equality of opportunity for all that they have chosen to incorporate some extremely controversial issues in the Bill with others on which there would have been broad consensus. For example, there was considerable debate in the House about home affairs matters. It was assumed that because stalking and the paedophile register were issues on which there was consensus, it was sensible to put them into separate Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this Bill, numerous issues on which there is consensus have been bundled together with extremely controversial issues. That will be of disbenefit to schools. We shall hold up progress on the issues on which there is consensus because we shall be arguing about the issues on which there is dissent. I agree that if we could drop part I of the Bill, we could make swift progress. That would be welcomed by all who have an interest in education in the world outside the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason why we must discuss the sittings motion is that several clauses contain serious resource implications for the education budget. I am not sure that they have been paid sufficient regard in the Bill and we shall have to tease out those implications in our deliberations. For example, if grant-maintained schools can increase their number by up to 50 per cent., without that being seen to be a change in the character of the schools, that could have serious implications for local authority areas where there is currently a surplus of places or where the expansion of grant-maintained schools could lead to a surplus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, we are already seeing resource implications in some areas because of increased selection. Children in primary schools in the London borough of Bromley, for example, cannot gain access to places in secondary schools in the borough because of the selection and creaming-off of children from outside the borough. The Government have created that position. It has immense implications for planning and resources on local education authority budgets and it is difficult for children who do not know, even at the end of the summer term, which school they will next attend.

Finally—[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."]. I could talk at some length if hon. Members so wished. Conservative Members, including members of the Committee, voted against a ten-minute Bill on the regulation of supply teachers. Despite the

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Government's initial rejection of those proposals, I am delighted that they have seen sense and decided to include a clause on that matter in the Bill. However, it is unclear whether the proposals in that clause are sufficient to ensure not only that our children are safe when they are taught by supply teachers but that they receive the proper quality of education. That is especially important because up to one in 15 classes are taught by supply teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall seek time to debate probing amendments designed to discover what the Government intend to do under the tiny clause on that matter which is at the end of the Bill. I shall table further amendments that would create a proper structure, so that when we form a Government in the not too distant future there will be no need to deal with a matter that this Government have botched yet again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I welcome you, Sir Michael, to the Chair. I wish that there were consensus so that we could consider the many matters that must be debated as swiftly as you and I would like. But I fear that, because the Government are using the Bill for party political rather than educational purposes, we shall not be able to work in that manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like other members of the Committee, Sir Michael, I welcome your tutelage of the Committee. As you have already demonstrated, you will keep us on the straight and narrow in matters of procedure. I am pleased that Mr. O'Hara will be deputising very ably for you when necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for missing the start of the sitting. Just as I was leaving my room, one of the newspapers in north Wales called me to tell me of its comments on the league tables that will be published tomorrow. Of course, as the education spokesperson for Wales, I felt duty bound to give the paper the benefit of my views on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mixed feelings about this debate because I heard nothing that the Minister said about the sittings motion. I am concerned about one or two aspects of the motion from diametrically opposed points of view. First, I was surprised that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Evans), who is responsible for education in Wales, is not a member of the Committee because an important part of the Bill deals with restructuring education and training in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the clauses on the National Council for Vocational Qualifications and the Qualifications, Curriculum and Assessment Authority for Wales, which I welcome. But, because the authority will have a slightly different standing from the body proposed for England—in some respects it will act as an agent for the English authority—I should have liked the Under-Secretary of State for Wales to explain exactly how the restructuring will work in Wales. I am at a loss to understand why he has not been able to find a place in the Committee. It may be because his views on caning do not coincide with those of the Prime Minister and it would perhaps have put a strain on the Committee if the Under-Secretary felt in difficulty when we discussed the amendment tabled by the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. That is one part of the Bill about which I have some doubt as to whether we shall have sufficient time under the sittings motion to debate all the issues, especially as we shall have answers by proxy from Ministers from the Welsh Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to how time could be saved, which has been alluded to by other hon. Members. The Minister said that it would not be proper for him to do some of the things that were being suggested, but I hope that he will give more consideration to those suggestions. He is well versed and experienced in educational matters and apart from the GERBIL—the great Education Reform Bill, which became the Education Reform Act 1988—we have sat opposite each other on all the other Bills on education that have proceeded through the House. It seems that education has been influenced by what I call the MT factor. I refer not to the MT who was Prime Minister for a considerable time but to Mao Tse-tung. China had a period of continual revolution and hardly a day went by without some new and major change being announced. It has been a bit like that with education in the past decade or so. Unfortunately, many of the new Bills were introduced to undo the damage of the previous ones. That is why I am concerned about some aspects of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not "MT" also refer to Militant Tendency? That group also believes in permanent revolution and it inflicted a lot of damage. Does my hon. Friend agree that the extreme right and the extreme left seem to meet each other and come together, at least in terms of their modus operandi?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an attractive argument, but the sittings motion will not allow me to go into that in any more detail. However, I am sure that members of the Committee heard it and will want to take it on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of ways that we could reduce the amount of time needed to consider the Bill. As a quid pro quo, we could perhaps expand the time available to deal with the important part covering Wales and the different relationship between the new Qualifications, Curriculum and Assessment Authority for Wales and the English body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part II of the Bill is entirely irrelevant in Wales, which has no schools that have overt procedures for selection, although there is one possible example that attracted some infamous publicity a week or so ago when it appeared that heavy pressure was being applied to have selection by the back door. But, publicly and overtly, there are no selective schools in Wales. From consultations undertaken by the Welsh Office and the old county councils in Wales and their head teachers, I believe that fewer than a handful of head teachers want to consider selection even at a level of 10 per cent, 15 per cent or 20 per cent. When selection became an issue in one local authority—the old West Glamorgan authority—only one secondary school head teacher wanted to be able partially to select for his school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So part I of the Bill is totally irrelevant to Wales. Perhaps that is one reason why the Minister responsible for education in Wales, the hon. Member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Evans), is not a member of the Committee. Perhaps he looked at part I of the Bill and thought, "That is totally irrelevant in Wales", looked at part II and thought "Fewer than 1 per cent of all schools in Wales are grant maintained, so that is rather on the margins of my responsibilities", and decided not to join the Committee. If the proportion of schools that are grant maintained were the same in England as in Wales, there would only be about 200 of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So parts I and II are almost totally irrelevant to Wales. Perhaps even at this stage we should ask the Government to withdraw those parts of the Bill; we know that they have acted in that way on other occasions when it has been shown how wrong and irrelevant their proposals have been. Sometimes the Government admit to mistakes. There would be great joy in heaven if they were to do so on this occasion by withdrawing those parts of the Bill, which would both reduce the time needed to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that several of his colleagues have made exactly the same speech this morning about those parts of the Bill. I am sure that the Minister has heard what his colleagues had to say. In view of the hon. Gentleman's anxiety that we have adequate time, and in order to support the Chair in ensuring that he and his colleagues have that time—they will have it, because I am a very independent Chairman who makes sure that people have an opportunity to speak in debates—will he help the Chair by allowing us to start to make progress with the Bill? He will have adequate opportunity to argue against any provision in the Bill during our future sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will immediately stop talking about parts I and II, Sir Michael.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wanted to reinforce the point for the Minister who has in the past listened to arguments put to him from the Opposition—most notably about the code of practice for the identification and assessment of special educational needs, which will stand as one of the great monuments to educational progress. Perhaps it should be called the Forth code of practice because the Minister made a tremendous effort to try to get it right and to listen to the misgivings we had about the code's development. Although it is still not absolutely perfect, he undertook to hold a review of its workings during the first three years. That is why I felt it worth while to raise the subject again. Contrary to the impression that the Minister gives of being a hard and determined person, I know that under that hard exterior there is a malleable, listening Minister who wants to do his best for education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will leave that subject altogether, and turn briefly to another issue. Because it has also already been raised, I will not speak about it at any great length, but I want to point out one or two parts of the Bill about which there is broad agreement about what needs to be done. About two thirds of the Bill—about 100 pages
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
of it—could be the subject of a consensual approach, because in terms of objective and principle, we agree with the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have already produced a substantial guidance document, the notes on clauses, which is almost bigger than the Bill itself and which explains in less legalistic language what the clauses are intended to do. It ought not to be beyond the Minster's wit—and this is my plea—to ensure, through the usual channels initially, that we can come to some agreement on matters on which the Minister knows we share the Government's objectives. I am not talking about DFEE official guidance for general distribution—that must be listened to—but the Minister must have an inkling of the way in which the clauses will be put into effect. I hope that there will be consultation, through the usual channels, so that the Minister can expand on and elucidate those parts of the Bill on which there is broad agreement of objectives. That would enable us to deal with two thirds of the Bill much more expeditiously than might normally be possible. My plea is that the Minister will give some thought to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also tell us today exactly how his partnership with the Welsh Office will work? How will he deal with any detailed questions that I may have on how the Welsh body will operate and on its relationship with the English body? More importantly, the Secretary of State for Wales will be given certain powers under the clauses relating to Wales, which opens up the possibility of developments in Wales being slightly different from those in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate on the sittings motion is an appropriate time to bring such matters to the Minister's attention; when we come to consider clauses 43 to 48, which relate to Wales, I do not want to be asking questions on how the Welsh body will operate only to be told by the Minister that he will consult with his colleagues in the Welsh Office and come back to me at some later stage. I hope that we shall be thoroughly prepared and that the Welsh Office—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman gets hopelessly bogged down—he is making rather heavy weather of the point, which I concede is important in the Welsh context—I should tell him that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales takes the view that, given that the matter is largely consensual, as the hon. Gentleman kindly acknowledges, it should be possible to deal with it properly on a basis that is not unknown in Standing Committees: either my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Education or I will undertake to deal with those clauses—I hope to the hon. Gentleman's satisfaction. We are conscious of the responsibilities that we are taking on and I stand duly notified by, if not warned of, the hon. Gentleman's intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his intervention, which was exactly what I had hoped to hear from him, knowing that in Committee he has always been anxious to please Opposition Members. Given his undertaking, and having flagged up my

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
concerns, I sit down in the hope that we can consider some of the more substantive issues, despite my deep dislike of the first two parts of the Bill and their total irrelevance to Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure, Sir Michael, once again to serve on a Committee under your chairmanship. For me, parliamentary life is coming full circle; when I became a Member of Parliament in 1992, the first Committee on which I served was that discussing the Finance Bill, when I had the pleasure of serving under your chairmanship, Sir Michael. In those days we referred to you as Mr. Shersby, and it is a great pleasure for us all to note that since then your services have been properly recognised and we may now address you as Sir Michael.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our sittings at that time were not as well organised as we hope these will be. During our discussions in 1992 on the Finance Bill, we strayed far into the night on several occasions, listening to speeches of great pertinence from my hon. Friends, which certainly kept us away from our beds for many hours. I remember a speech by my hon. Friend the Member of Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson) in which he conveyed to us at great length the wit and wisdom of the members of the Hartlepool working men's club and set out their views on the Government's Budget. They seemed to have more to say to us on that occasion than Ministers, but at that time matters were discussed at greater length than most of us on the Committee would have wished in terms of the efficient expedition and conclusion of our business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of Education Bill Committee proceedings, I am a virgin. This is my first time and, along with other members of the Committee, I wish to learn from the experience of battle-hardened veterans of such proceedings. I shall wish to reflect on many issues and ensure that there is adequate time in which to consider them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has already been said, one great problem is that the Government cannot make up their mind on educational matters. No sooner has one Bill been passed into law than the Government return with a further Bill to amend it. That is the situation with which we are faced at present, and it is why it will be necessary to ensure that our time is properly allocated so that what, for many of us, are complicated issues are given adequate attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains contentious aspects. Much of what we shall be considering is not a straightforward new approach to education, but an amendment to previous legislation. To understand the Bill and to enable it to be considered properly, members of the Committee have not only to read it as drafted, but to refer back to previous legislation, especially the Education Act 1996. We must know how that Act will be amended. It is a matter not simply of reaching a decision on what is before us, but of knowing why the Government intended the 1996 Act to read as it did and why they are now suggesting—a few months later—that it should be amended. Such an issue will present a procedural problem for many of us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for drawing that matter to the Committee's attention. When I first read the Bill, it passed through my mind that I would have to keep referring to the 1996 Act to see what was happening. Does my hon. Friend know whether it will be possible for half a dozen of the copies of the 1996 Act to be made available in the Room so that we can refer to it occasionally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that copies of the Act can be made available. The Bill is extremely complicated and it is almost impossible to make sense of it without the benefit of having to hand copies of previous legislation. Although this is my first Education Bill Committee, I am aware that there are some Conservative Members for whom it may be the last. I am sure that they will want the opportunity to consider matters. I understand that the hon. Member for Finchley (Mr. Booth) is departing his parliamentary life at the end of this Session, so this will obviously .be his last Education Bill Committee. In another context, I understand that the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) may have to be carried away kicking and screaming; of course, I wish him well in his future career. I am sure that he, too, will want a proper chance to consider the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For at least the next few weeks, the suggested sittings of the Committee will cause Opposition Members a different problem. Ministers—and, indirectly, Conservative Members—can call on a great deal of expertise and advice. Indeed, they have myriad advisers. Of course, we are not formally allowed to recognise their presence in the Room, but it is always felt, particularly by way of the notes which do not exist that appear so regularly. Ministers, who I hope have been thinking about the Bill for some time, can, with the backing of their advisers, read out their well-rehearsed speeches, which they will claim to have written themselves. Nevertheless, we know where the words come from. Opposition Members, however, often have to rely on their own devices—hard-pressed staff, many of whom have other things to do, and on outside organisations, who often give their expertise and advice voluntarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Government suggest that we sit four times a week, that would put enormous pressure on Opposition Members. Unlike Ministers, who have advice available to them, we rely on self-help and voluntary help to hold the Government properly to account for what they propose to do to our nation's education. We therefore hope that in trying to allow proper time to consider the more important aspects of the Bill, the Government will ensure that, in practice, there are three rather than four sittings a week. That will enable the Opposition more critically and properly to assess what is intended. Indeed, if Ministers are open-minded—until proved otherwise, I am sure that they are open to reasonable argument—they will allow us time to reflect on what we want to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be some matters, particularly in later parts of the Bill, where we agree in principle with the Government's proposals but have reservations about their practical implementation. Ministers should be able to listen and to reflect on what we have to say, as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
happened in the Committee considering the Housing Act 1996 on which I served, when Ministers accepted that many of our suggestions were practical and reasonable, and that they would amend the Bill accordingly. That will be possible with this Bill only if our sittings allow us proper time for reflection. The House's consideration of the Bill might continue for a little longer than the Government initially wanted, but it is not our intention unreasonably to hold up the Bill. We want the opportunity to properly criticise, probe, investigate and put forward suggestions about how proper improvements might be made. That is the role of the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not, at the moment, want to go into detail of what we shall be considering. Nor do I want to go into details of the new clause proposed by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. However, it would be wholly appropriate for me to make it absolutely clear—I am sure that I also speak for the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs)—that a distinction must be drawn between whipping and flogging. Both sides have Whips, but the floggers are all on one side. Long may that remain so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a serious point to be made, to which the hon. Member for Bath and my hon. Friend the Member for Barking referred earlier: it is the Opposition's job to point out any inadequacies in Government proposals, even when we agree with the proposals in principle. That could so much better be done in this case if the time we spent on the Bill were extended. We recognise that we cannot extend the total time we spend on it, but if Ministers accepted that if, after 17 years in government and almost five years of this Parliament, the Government have still not got right issues that are contentious and which do not have public support, such as the extension of selection, of grant-maintained schools and of the assisted places scheme—issues on which we are bitterly divided and on which the Government do not speak for the country—trying to legislate on them only a few weeks before the Government change from Conservative to Labour is not the right way to proceed. If the Government accepted the areas of consensus, such as the amendment on discipline tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) several months ago—which the Government appear to have accepted—and allow the Committee enough time to discuss them seriously over a few weeks, we could do much good for pupils, teachers and education by getting the matters right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath was right to say that the first part of the Bill is contentious and ill thought out and that if we could agree to drop it now, our proceedings would be much the better for it. That is consistent with our approach on Second reading when we asked for a Special Standing Committee to allow evidence to be taken. Even with the best efforts, the matters are contentious and we shall need to refer regularly to what is happening in schools by drawing on practical experience and examining how selection,
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
grant-maintained schools and the assistend places scheme work in operation. The best way of doing that is by taking evidence from those who are affected, but that is not what we shall do—and that is another reason why the Government should consider those issues on which there is agreement in principle. If they did that, we could spend our time more productively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Barking rightly drew attention to the fact that the general intentions of the Bill are widely drawn. The Government suggest that the new clauses pertinent to each part of the Bill be taken with our discussions on amendments to individual clauses rather than, as sometimes occurs, all new clauses being taken at the end. However, as well as taking new clauses that relate directly to existing parts of the Bill as we go along, we can also—because the Bill is so widely drawn—take at the end new clauses that refer only to the general issues with which the Bill is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Barking said, it may still be possible to table new clauses on several issues that are not directly referred to in the Bill. We must therefore give sufficient time to those issues because the Government are not necessarily the best judge of the needs of pupils, their schools and relevant education matters that we shall be discussing in Committee. Opposition Members want to raise a number of issues that the Government have not given attention to in the Bill and which will need proper consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need sufficient time to attend to those matters and to formulate our arguments by seeking evidence from teacher and parent organisations and others with an interest in education. If the Government will not allow us time to do that on a formal basis, we have no alternative but to ensure that we have the opportunity, as the Bill proceeds, to take advice and suggestions from all groups concerned about education. At least one side of the Committee will then have that evidence to add to the debate and our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for us to debate this issue this morning to show that from our perspective we need sufficient time to collect evidence on the way. We want to ensure that we can table considered and reasoned amendments and that we have time to discuss the basic disagreements in principle that we have about the early parts of the Bill. We need time to give detailed consideration to matters that we may agree in principle but about which we have practical questions as to the precise detail. We want to probe and explore such matters and hope that Ministers will have an open-minded attitude, whereby they nay be willing to accept some of our suggestions to improve the proposed legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that all that will be possible and that we can reach a working arrangement. I hope, too, that we shall sit three rather than four times a week to ensure that we can do our job as Opposition Members. There is clear evidence that the previous time the Government took a Bill through the House, they got it wrong because only a few weeks later they wanted to table amendments to their own legislation. That
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
should not happen again provided that we get the chance to table amendments that the Minister is open minded enough to accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am one of those who has not had the benefit of your wise chairmanship in Committee, Sir Michael. I look forward to the next few weeks in which I shall learn about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important debate to see how we shall focus the time that we have available. The Minister suggested a certain flexibility in the use of the sittings motion, although it is in itself a somewhat inflexible motion. I very much hope that he will be flexible and that our debates will be rounded as we consider the different important issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the third Education Bill Committee on which I have served. If the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth has served on every Education Bill since 1979, clearly it follows that he has more responsibility than anyone else for the state of the education system now, but I am sure that he would not want to claim that responsibility. Of the two Bills with which I have been involved, one set up the Teacher Training Agency. I suspect, from looking at the costs of the agency and the service that it provides and comparing those with the previous costs for the same work, it was a very expensive Bill. The second Bill on which I served was the Education (Student Loans) Act 1996, which was a complete waste of time because the private sector would not play ball.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that we shall be wasting our time debating this Bill because there are important issues to explore. I hope that the division of time will be rather different from the mood reflected on Second Reading. Conservative Members seemed interested only in two topics, one of which was selection—an important matter which will take us some time to debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, like many other hon. Members, regard the first three parts of the Bill to be essentially destructive, and we intend to explain why we think that that is so. The remainder of the Bill contains several constructive proposals, about which there will perhaps be rather more agreement, but, even so, I hope that there will be adequate time to debate them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) said, because we can table any new clause that we wish when we debate part X, which deals with miscellaneous matters, we shall have an opportunity to discuss several other issues, many of which Government might not consider worthy of debate. But I am sure that we could come to an agreement about other matters that could contribute to our education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government want to put the Bill onto the statute book by 1 May or perhaps rather earlier. We will not stop them doing that because we recognise the fact that the Bill will be put to the general public in the election. The extent to which some of the provisions of the Bill proceed and take effect will depend on the outcome of the election. As my hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe said, the outcome will be that the destructive parts of the Bill will not proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
Given the performance of the education system as shown in recent reports, the Government should not be proud of their 17-year record; there is considerable room for improvement. We could have improved on the findings of any education report produced during the past 17 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be careful about the first part of the Bill because it will lead to greater division and, as I know from the experience of my constituency, less choice in the education system. We must consider selection very carefully. We must also consider the effect of implementing some of the clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday I had a conversation with the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan), who referred to the amount of capital that was necessary for education in my constituency. I acknowledge that permission to spend that capital has come from the Government. However, that capital is needed to accommodate school choice in Morley. When we discuss provisions on such matters, I shall contend that some of the work done using that capital would be put under great strain almost immediately if a system of selection, especially of forced selection, were introduced in Morley. I shall explain that in detail when we debate specific amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government proposals are wasteful and many parents have no choice. The Government should consider parental choice and be much more explicit about what has become known as the Greenwich judgment. One of the problems in my constituency is that, although there are adequate school places for the community of Morley, because the schools are attractive, they are attractive to people in other districts. We ought to be given clearer guidance from the Government about what the Greenwich judgment means. I do not suggest that people should not cross district borders to go to school; they should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

People choose to go to local authority high schools, and my local authority accepts such people. Applicants from the neighbouring district automatically receive places, but choice is exercised to decide which parents from my district—the community of Morley—receive places at the school of their choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I want to hear the remarks of the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend is absolutely right. I made it clear that it is perfectly reasonable for people to cross district boundaries in order for their children to attend the school of their choice. However, the same rules of selection should apply: it should not be automatic that people who want to cross a boundary are able to do so and be accepted by a school to the exclusion of people who live within that community. I will explain that point further when we come to the relevant clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to selection, there are other matters that we should explore in some detail. Only this morning, while the Committee has been sitting, I have learnt that a five-year-old will be permanently excluded from a school in my constituency. I believe that he will be the youngest child in the country to be permanently excluded or expelled from a school. I have no doubt that that case is very serious, but I ask the Government to consider the question of media involvement in the exclusion of pupils. That five-year-old was invited, with this mother, to appear on "The Big Breakfast". He appeared on television yesterday morning with his mother to talk about—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must resume his seat. My job is to try to help the Committee to make progress.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well understand your concern, Sir Michael. I would appear to be far from the sittings motion, but I assure you that I am not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must decide whether or not the hon. Gentleman is in order. It is my decision that he would be wise to direct his remarks to the sittings motion, which occupies two lines on the amendment paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel, Sir Michael, that some issues must be explored with care. I believe that the legislation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There will be adequate opportunity to explore all those matters when we reach the clauses that the Committee is here to discuss—
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
namely the clauses of the Education Bill. It is my duty to remind the hon. Gentleman that we have to discuss the sittings motion, namely that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>"
Will the hon. Gentleman please direct his remarks to those words?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Michael. I shall certainly do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been trying to argue that we should construct our debates in a way that will allow us to focus on matters of importance. For instance, exclusions will form an important part of our discussion of school discipline. We should not only debate the new clause proposed by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth but explore with some care how exclusion might be used constructively and the necessary appeal process. We should consider whether those who are excluded should be protected from the media. The fact that that is reasonable will become quite evident when the case is known more fully. There are some matters that should not be rushed through. That is what relates my speech to the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important that we should consider external qualifications. I would be interested to explore the Government's thinking on that subject and their view on inspections and careers guidance. We should be able to take part in a constructive debate on those questions, and both sides of the Committee should be able to make contributions based on what they consider necessary. We should then have more agreement than if we focused merely on parts I, II and III of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My plea is for a discussion that considers a range of important educational issues. We shall obviously debate selection fully, but we must ensure there is time in the latter stages of our consideration of the Bill for the Government's views on other matters to be explored and for alternatives to be put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arrangements for the sittings of the Committee should be flexible, and I support my hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe in that. We must focus our time so that we do not debate only those matters that we know will result in serious confrontation. A more constructive approach will be beneficial to the education system. We should not try to stop the Bill reaching the statute book; indeed, we like parts of it. The Bill will be implemented in any case, whatever the outcome of the general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Staffordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be presumptuous of me to welcome you to the Chair, Sir Michael, as this is my first day as a member of a Committee of the House. I am the new boy—what you might call newest Labour. I am here to learn, to be given information and advice and to gain a little experience. I am always reminded when starting somewhere new of the teacher who opened the window on my world. I have been looking in the Bill for the words "morale in our teaching profession will be enhanced", but I cannot find them, despite the fact that morale is at an all-time low in our education system. Teachers are leaving in droves and it is difficult to find
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0115">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
someone over 50 teaching in secondary schools. There is no mention in the Bill of secondary school teachers—there is not even any mention of a dress allowance, which is strange. [Hon. Members: "A dress allowance?"] For the dress code that I thought the Government were going to introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a problem with the timetable of the Bill because while we have a list of clauses, there is no overall plan or objectives. In fact, if a student in a teacher training college submitted the Bill in a test, he would fail. How can I know whether our sittings will be long or short enough to deal with the Bill? I know one thing: we are tabling amendments to make the Government consult, just as we shall consult as a Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is strange that I have not yet received the papers—although the Minister has—on his consultation on selection. The Bill does not reflect the rigorous educational and academic work that has been placed before the Minister—we are talking about children, not structures, buildings or governors. Where in the Bill are the back-up papers and the studies that show how well not selective schools, but other schools will do under selection and how schools will improve their academic achievements and value-added assessment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as my hon. Friend the Member for Walton said, the papers are not available, it is our duty to consult with education groups and to make them available. We will need time to do that. If we need the papers for discussion on the first clause, we do not have time to get them; it would make sense for education generally if we took the issues in some sort of order. Is it an Education Bill that will look after the welfare of our children, or an education dogma Bill? We must ask ourselves that. Do the Government merely want to shove through the Bill and keep to the timetable? We should consider the parts that we can agree on and which do not need the back-up of studies, and ensure that the Government have time to consult and to collect information, because without it we would once again be taking a leap in the dark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The education and future of our children are too important for the Government to go on lumbering from black hole to black hole. It is an opportunity, after 17 years, for them to make sure that they get it right before they go; they can leave behind them something substantial and long-lasting for our children's future. The Bill as it stands will not do that. It is not well thought out, consultations have not been carried out and the studies are not to hand; when I asked some questions in the Library, I was astounded to find that the Government had done no research there. That is why I am asking when the Government will produce the studies because it would be disgraceful and letting our children down to allow the Bill to go through without hon. Members having them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall address the detail of the Bill later and I shall ask questions at that stage, but if the Bill does not make use of the rigorous educational and academic work that has been carried out, the Government should not try to give it the credibility of an Education Bill because it will let our children down and we will have to sort our the mess next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to speak at length, but it is worth explaining that the sittings motion was deliberately structured to give the maximum flexibility in sittings. I am confident that, bearing in mind all that Opposition Members have said about the Bill and having made the Government's position clear, in spite of Opposition Members' pleas to drop parts of it even at this early stage, the flexibility of the sittings motion will enable us properly to ensure that the debates will be structured so that the Committee can give due time to what Opposition Members consider the contentious parts of the Bill, although swifter progress may be possible towards the latter parts of the Bill.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the start of a quite separate debate to that which will obtain in relation to the second half of the Bill. This is a Bill of two parts. The first amendment addresses the crucial issue of selection, which lies at what the Opposition argue is the overtly political heart of the Bill. It is about what Government Members describe as putting clear blue water between themselves and the Opposition parties in preparation for the impending general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other part of the Bill, with which we shall deal later, is of an educational nature—something with which we can agree for the most part, although, when the time comes, we shall explore the Government's true intentions. The reality is that we are dealing with selection in preparation for the Conservative party's political agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our debate on the sittings motion, I noted the Minister's comments about being teased by Opposition Members. I shall not tease the Minister because that would be like giving a pinprick to a man equipped with and ready to use a sabre in retaliation. I know that the Minister will take no hostages during our discussion of these and later amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments give us the opportunity for a general debate, in which some of the prinicpal disadvantages of selection can be drawn out, and we
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
will challenge the Minister to answer our points. In particular, we shall deal in detail with the way in which diversity narrows choice for most pupils, which can be illustrated by many examples.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman moves on to the damaging implications of selection, will he say whether, like me, he has reflected on the significant change made by the Government over the past three years? In particular, has he looked back at the Department's own circular 6/93? Paragraph 44 of that circular makes it absolutely clear that selection is not about giving more choice to parents. The paragraph says that a measure of specialisation
	<br><blockquote><p>"does not mean selection, which implies choice of school".</p></blockquote>
The crucial issue is that selection is not, as the Government claim, about providing more choice for parents, but is instead about schools selecting. That significant change has been made by the Government over the past three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has read my mind. My next note relates to circular 6/93, with which I am au fait mainly because of what happened in those intervening years in my son's school, the Liverpool Bluecoats school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there are grave difficulties with selection—I have never made a secret of my opinion of it. We have debated the issue across the House, within our party and, on a regular basis, in non-party educational circles. I am acutely aware of the way in which people self-select and buy into catchment areas of particular schools or enable themselves, through the judicious purchase of a house in the catchment areas of a feeder school—where that system operates—to ensure that their children go to the school of their choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo what the hon. Member for Bath said about circular 6/93. I have great sympathy with the clear objectives of that circular in its attempt to clarify where obfuscation seemed to rule. It is clear that those who knew their way around the system could use it to their advantage. I have first-hand, pertinent experience of selection—indeed, a great deal of publicity was generated by Conservatives because my son went to the Liverpool Bluecoats school. The school he was originally designated to attend became a grant-maintained school when I was a governor there. I felt it injudicious to consider that as an alternative for my son given my previous position as a governor and my having been vocal in my opposition to its grant-maintained status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, through pure geographical accident, I was fortunate in having a selection of schools in the area in which I have lived for many years. I knew that I could try for those schools but, because they were popular, I also knew that they would choose. When we consider the amendments in detail, we will make the point that although hon. Members on both sides of the House can pay lip service to choice and diversity, there has to be a balance between the two. Over-emphasis on one can cause great difficulties for the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
As the hon. Member for Bath said, circular 6/93 was drawn up on the basis of non-selection or at least on a sense of our neutrality with a weather-eye on the potential for selection. But the change in Government policy in the intervening period had much to do with a right-wing electoral agenda and little to do with education or the essential balance between choice and diversity, which common sense and practicality determine should be at the foremost of our considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the comments made by the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Walden) in the debate on the Queen's Speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his usual eloquent way, he said that the Bill has nothing to do with the educational needs of our children—or, indeed, with the economy and future of the country. He said that that was especially true of those aspects that deal with artificially imposed educational apartheid, whether through selection, the assisted places scheme or the extension of grant-maintained schools. I appreciate that the hon. Member for Buckingham has a singular view on that subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was waiting for this occasion, which I was confident would arise. The hon. Gentleman used the word "imposed". That is an interesting word because the tenor of the Bill is permissive. There will be no imposition. I hope that we can get away from the idea that a Bill that permits schools to do what they believe is desired in their area is an imposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that intervention. I do not disagree with him on that when there is unbridled choice for schools to do things on a level playing field. That would be fine, but to return to grant-maintained status—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to my hon. Friend in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among the legion examples is the classic one of a charge being made about a school in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) that undue pressure may have been brought from one side. In local debates on schools, there was one case in which there seemed to be an imposition of sorts coming from another side concerning the sort of publicity that could be afforded in favour of grant-maintained status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that on a number of occasions this morning, the Minister has referred to the permissive nature of the legislation? Does he also agree that freedom for one school may be a constraint on another, and that freedom for one institution may be a constraint on parents and children in the rest of that area? To say that the measure is permissive is to delude the public of the reality behind the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whenever anyone uses the word permissive, I think of the 1960s. I thought that the Conservative party was opposed to everything that came out of the sixties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a sixties sort of guy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that he is a sixties sort of guy. His tie must be left over from the sixties because it seems to be redolent of pop art.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There sometimes seems to be a failure on the Conservative Benches to make the distinction between liberty and licence. It seems to be those who are least able to defend themselves on whom the licence is practised. That is more marked in relation to those who are denied equal opportunity than to anyone else in the community. I can think of nothing more cruel than to deny children the opportunity to access the ladder of educational opportunity. There is no more important prerequisite to a child's full development to an active economic life in a cohesive society than being able to have full educational opportunity. We shall argue that that is denied to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the general background to my personal view of selection, based on my experience. You will recall, Sir Michael, the heady days of the 1987 general election when Lady Thatcher the then Prime Minister, was in her prime. During that election, all the plaudits, if not the votes, went to a Labour party political broadcast during which Neil Kinnock said that he was the first Kinnock in a 1,000 generations to have gone to university.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hartley Booth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What happened to him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks what became of him—he is a Commissioner of the European Union, which will warm the cockles of the hearts of Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comment of the former Leader of the Opposition produced resonance with many people. Selection could be good for those in the short term who were advantaged by it and I confess that I was one of those. I was the 13th of 14 children—Conservative Members may be horrified to know that there are another 13 like me. I passed what was then referred to as the scholarship and went to a very good school. But when we discuss discipline, Sir Michael, I shall relate to you the details of the many and varied beatings that I received as a means of inculcating Latin verbs and declensions into my less than receptive consciousness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, it was a very good school and remains so to this day. It has applied for grant-maintained status, as the Minister will undoubtedly be aware. At that school, we were hived off—we were taken away from our neighbourhood, families and friends on a somewhat arbitrary basis. History has shown that many of my siblings were certainly more gifted intellectually than I could hope to be—Conservative Members might say that that is not saying a great deal—but the litmus test was selection at the age of 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my family, the only people who could benefit from the system were my younger brother and I. That was determined not by educational ability as such, but by economic opportunity. Because we were at the tail end of a very large family, we could afford the compulsory uniform and pay for the bus to school—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
we did not qualify for the bus pass at that time. There were all sorts of outside considerations which had nothing to do with educational factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, many others in my family and among my friends and neighbours did not get such an opportunity and they were sent to the local secondary modern schools. Had I not gone to St. Edward's college, as it was called, through the scholarship by selection, I would have gone with my brother to St. Edward's orphanage—the orphanage doubled up as our local secondary school. Matters have moved on since then, but the only thing that those two schools had in common was their name. The quality of education was vastly different and the opportunities that ensued from that education were light years apart. That scenario is still implied by selection today—there is an arbitrary hiving off of a certain number of people, which has all sorts of effects, as it did in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before discussing the substance of the amendment, I want to mention things that I see around me which suggest that life has not changed a great deal. Earlier this year, the House of Commons produced ratings of socio-economic class, constituency by constituency. It will come as no surprise to many Committee members that Liverpool, Walton came bottom of the list—presumably, safe, blue-ribbon Tory seats were at the top. My constituency is a lumpen proletarian seat with a Member of Parliament to match. My constituents are lumpen because they do not have access to educational opportunities or qualifications, mainly, but not only, for economic and social reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that coming from where I do, I do not have quite the knowledge of Liverpool, Walton that he does. There is a big question that Conservative Members want answered: in some local authority areas, Labour has been in power and controlled the local education system for 25 years. The problem has not been a lack of resources because, in may cases, more money than the national average has been put into education in those areas, yet we still have failings in the Labour authorities. Does the hon. Gentleman feel that there is something inherently wrong in Labour's philosophy in those areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. There is a dangerous tendency during the Committee stage of a Bill such as this or in debates on the Floor of the House to over simplify matters and to come up with simple nostrums as answers to complex issues which require full debate. I am not one of those who will defend a Labour local authority, or any other local authority, if it is not delivering the goods, although I take into account the constraints placed on it and the circumstances with which it is faced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real problem—one of many—is that, unlike for colleagues in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, a cultural difference persists in England. We believe that it is all well and good for a relatively small proportion of youngsters to have the finest academic education and for the rest to be considered as a huge pool of
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
hewers of wood and drawers of water to service industries that no longer exist. One of the lessons that has been learnt in the past 20 years—gradually at first, but like a thunderbolt in recent years—is the fact that a cohesive modern economy requires us to upskill and upgrade all our youngsters. That is my point about selection, which maintains and exacerbates the division that has traditionally existed between those who are academically gifted and those who are gifted in other ways, perhaps vocationally. It also fails to recognise that, although people go through different cognitive stages—all my Piaget is coming back to me now—it does not happen at a set age. All people must have the opportunity to achieve their educational aspirations but not necessarily at arbitrary cut-off points which pre-ordain their future educational place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We noted the hon. Member for Dover's concern about public expenditure and getting value for money but I wonder whether my hon. Friend would like to direct the hon. Gentleman's attention a little closer to home. There is an independent, selective school in his constituency, which received £140,672 of taxpayers' money last year. That is £5,210 per pupil, yet that school had below average GCSE results for children obtaining five grade A to C passes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Dover will, in the fullness of time, dwell on those statistics and intervene in the debate to give the Committee his considered opinion on who is the culprit and, if we are to draw an equation between the amount of money put in and the effect of that investment, on whether independent schools are as cost-effective as they should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To take up the point made by the hon. Member for Devonport, the Committee may wish to deliberate further on the question of value for money, which sparked off a thought in my mind about Hackney Downs school, and about the amount of money per pupil that is spent in some boroughs, such as Southwark and Islington—just to take two at random. If one considers the amount of taxpayers' money spent on schools in such areas, one sees, on the face of it, precious little return for the money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is equally the case that we may wish to discuss the amount of money that is put into the assisted places scheme. Where does that money come from? Where should that money go? What does it mean in terms of overall achievement for all our children and not just for a preferred few?

To return to what I was saying about all our yesterdays and about the extended selection that we used to have in my day—the day, I am sure, of most hon. Members here present—I mentioned that my constituency is officially classed as lumpen. That is not peculiar to only one or two cities—indeed, just ahead of my constituency is that of my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside—but relates directly to the social and economic class of people from which schools draw. My constituency reflects that.

I am also concerned about the many people who have embarked on what we now call a second chance to learn when, in fact, it is their first real chance. A few years ago, I was at the newly established Sir John Moores University in Liverpool, and I must confess my sublime ignorance of what was happening in that university. As I walked about, I noticed vast numbers of middle-aged women, and I thought that there must be a conference going on. When I spoke to the vice-chancellor and asked whether some sort of conference was taking place, he said, "No, this is our student body." As a result of that, he sent me the figures showing the huge proportion of the student body who were on a second chance to learn, which I would argue was a first chance to learn. There were women with young families, women who had brought up their families and women who had not had the time, energy or the wherewithal to achieve their own potential and who, in turn, had put their efforts into the wider community use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were huge numbers of them. I know many of them personally and have spoken to them about their lifetime opportunities. They were discarded at the age of 11 on the basis of arbitrary selection. They suffered the added discrimination of being young women and the low level of expectation afforded to them as such. They had to fight not only economic constraints but all the prejudice that goes along with being women with families in order to go back to education. But the crucial decision made in their case was when they were up for selection, and they lost out. We all should be conscious of that as we go through the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we argue about selection on a purely political basis, I am afraid that that will rebound badly in the Government's face. I am also bound to say that other than in the heartlands where selection is seen as a means of reinforcing the status quo, where it is more about social status than educational progress, there is no demand for selection—quite the reverse. People all want the very best education that they can get for their own children. That is the most natural thing in the world, but when it is pointed out that under selection there are winners and losers, no one wants to see their children lose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments introduce prior requirements before schedule 1 applies. The schedule, activated by clause 1, introduces the relaxation of controls over selection for county and voluntary schools. Selection in GM schools is to be found later, under clauses 4 and 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that there is not a political basis for arguing for selection—at least not on the Conservative Benches? We argue for selection because we believe that it is right. I have been following the hon. Gentleman's remarks, but does he agree that the problem is not about selection but about flexibility? If we made it easier for children to move between schools, would not that answer the hon. Gentleman's objections?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the case because practical issues determine what happens. The hon. Gentleman will understand that I am being absolutely sincere when I tell him that I spoke to some independent schools not long ago and said that in my humble view there would be a blurring in years to come between private and state providers of education in a variety of ways. That has nothing to do with politics. It is about the shift from a teaching to a learning context and the new forms of information technology and new mechanisms by which people can learn. There will be a different mix. Inevitably, there will be huge flexibility in the future, but I do not think what is happening here and now has anything to do with flexibility.

If the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth will bear with me, I shall point out certain criteria that need to be applied, and I do not think that there will be any difference between us on them. The Bill as it stands does not satisfy those requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the amendments, clause 1 would operate to bring the schedule into effect only in a given local education authority area designated by the Secretary of State. She, or he, could do so only when satisfied that selection would benefit that area against the criteria to which I have just referred. In addition, designation could occur only after consultation with the relevant LEAs and voluntary authorities. It is extraordinary that a Government who seek to rule by consent can deny levels of consultation involving everyone concerned—something that everyone has taken for granted hitherto.

The problem for Ministers is that the four criteria set out in amendment No. 55 are unarguable. I wait to see whether Ministers will argue with those criteria when their invisible friends point out what they believe to be the difficulties with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
