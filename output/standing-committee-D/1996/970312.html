	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Andrew Mitchell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Social Security (Incapacity for Work and Severe Disablement Allowance) Amendment Regulations 1997.</p></blockquote>
The draft regulations were laid before the House on 24 February. They make changes to the severe disablement allowance legislation, which was introduced in 1984, and to the incapacity benefit legislation, which was introduced in 1995. The primary purpose of the proposed changes is to simplify existing medical test arrangements. In the case of severe disablement allowance, they also target more closely resources on people who are most severely disabled and for whom the benefit has always primarily been intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be aware that the draft regulations were subject to a consultation exercise carried out by the Social Security Advisory Committee. I would like to take this early opportunity to offer the Government's thanks to the Social Security Advisory Committee, and to those individuals and organisations who responded to the consultation exercise, for their consideration of the draft regulations and their comments upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating the draft regulations today under the agreed special procedures for parliamentary scrutiny that were laid down in the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) Act 1994. They require regulations made under certain powers in the Act within four years of Royal Assent, however minor, to be passed by affirmative resolution of each House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Severe disablement allowance is a tax-free, noncontributory, income-maintenance benefit, which was introduced in 1984 as a replacement for two earlier benefits: non-contributory invalidity pension and housewives' non-contributory invalidity pension. It is intended to provide an income for people who are incapable of work and severely disabled, but who have not had the opportunity to pay sufficient contributions to qualify for incapacity benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Incapacity benefit was introduced in April 1995 to replace invalidity benefit and represented a major reform of the contributory benefits available to people who cannot be expected to work because of the effects of an illness or disability. To be entitled to incapacity benefit, claimants must, unless their illness is short term, pass the all work test of incapacity. The test was introduced to provide an objective test of people's ability to work, to ensure that the benefit is targeted on those who are genuinely unable to work for medical reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be entitled to severe disablement allowance, claimants must also pass the all work test of incapacity and, if incapacity began after the age of 20, they must in addition pass an 80 per cent. disablement test. That means that some people claiming SDA must undergo two separate medical examinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The all work test is a relatively new test and we have been monitoring very closely the way in which it has worked. A number of exercises have been carried out to assess the experience of the Benefits Agency doctors and adjudication officers who have been applying the test since it was introduced in April 1995. Our monitoring shows that virtually every claimant who satisfies the severe disablement allowance 80 per cent. disablement test at a medical examination goes on to be found incapable of work under the all work test. The reverse is not true, which suggests that the medical examination for the 80 per cent. disablement test is harder to satisfy than the medical examination for the all work test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That clearly creates unnecessary administrative duplication and has attracted criticism from lobby groups to the effect that some severe disablement allowance claimants are needlessly required to undertake two examinations. We have been sympathetic to that point of view and our proposed solution is to provide for those who have been assessed as being at least 80 per cent. disabled to be deemed automatically to satisfy the all work test of incapacity. That measure will directly benefit approximately 8,500 people a year who will no longer have to be medically examined for the all work test. It is pleasing to note that it has been welcomed by the Social Security Advisory Committee. We also propose to deem those assessed as being at least 80 per cent. disabled for the purposes of industrial injuries and war disablement pension as satisfying the all work test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consideration of the proposals to simplify the medical test arrangements required us to look closely at the current provisions under which people can be automatically treated as satisfying the severe disablement allowance 80 per cent. disablement test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions, which are often referred to as the passporting criteria, were introduced with the severe disablement allowance in 1984. They represented an administrative easement that was based on the principle that people should not be required to have a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
medical examination if it was clear that they would be found to be 80 per cent. disabled. The latest medical advice is that some of the current passporting criteria can no longer be regarded as adequate measures of 80 per cent. disablement. That is supported by operational experience. We therefore propose to limit the passporting criteria to those that clearly indicate 80 per cent. disablement, thereby more accurately reflecting the original policy intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I discuss each of the passports that we intend to remove, I ask the Committee to bear in mind the fact that those who will no longer have an automatic passport through the 80 per cent. disablement test will not, of course, necessarily be denied severe disablement allowance. They will simply be required to satisfy the 80 per cent. disablement test in the same way as other claimants. It does not even follow that such people will need to be examined—the adjudicating medical authority may conclude from paper evidence that they satisfy the 80 per cent. disablement test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The criteria that we intend to remove as passports—because they are not of themselves adequate measures of 80 per cent. disablement—are, first, receipt of the middle rate care component and the highest rate mobility component of disability living allowance, entitlement to which is based not on levels of disability but on the extent to which the person needs personal care and/or supervision and/or has difficulty getting around; secondly, registration as being partially sighted—one of the possible criteria for registration is visual acuity between 6/60 and normal but with restricted visual fields, which often does not equate to 80 per cent. disablement; and thirdly, receipt of the mobility supplement of the war disablement pension, for which there is no requirement to be assessed as being 80 per cent. disabled. That is a very minor change which will affect about 10 people a year. War pension mobility supplement is paid in addition to the war disablement pension. It will remain as a passport for those who have for that purpose been assessed as being at least 80 per cent. disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we also propose a change that will help to tidy up legislation but which will affect no one—we shall remove receipt of attendance allowance as a passport through the 80 per cent. disablement test. Since the introduction of disability living allowance in 1992, attendance allowance has been available only to people aged 65 or over, whereas severe disablement allowance can be claimed only by people under 65.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the areas where passports in their original form will continue. In addition to people who have been assessed as being at least 80 per cent. disabled for the purposes of entitlement to the war disablement pension, people will continue to be passported through the 80 per cent. disablement test if they receive the highest rate of care component of disability living allowance or industrial injuries benefit on the basis that they are at least 80 per cent. disabled;
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
if they are entitled to an invalid carriage or to vaccine damage payments; or if they are registered as being blind. With the exceptions of the highest rate care component of disability living allowance and award of an invalid carriage, each requires a stringent medical examination, which is, on its own, a perfectly adequate measure of 80 per cent. disablement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already mentioned that disability living allowance is based on care needs rather than on levels of disability. However, we have decided to retain the highest rate care component as a passport because there is a greater likelihood of those in receipt suffering from a higher level of disability. Hon. Members may be aware that there has been some discussion about whether the passport for those people who are in receipt of an invalid carriage should be removed because only a relatively small number of people have a carriage and are under the age of 65. However, we are satisfied that an award of an invalid carriage was normally made on the basis of physical disablement of at least 80 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, the regulations are intended to refine the way that severe disablement allowance is administered, to ensure that rules are as simple as they can be and that they are fair. The rules will be manifestly simpler, because 8,500 people will now have to undergo only one medical examination instead of two. The rules will be fairer because people will now be passported through the eligibility test for severe disablement allowance only if there is a near certainty that they would be 80 per cent. disabled or more. For those people where the evidence is not so clear cut, I believe it is right and fair that they should be expected to undergo the same scrutiny as the majority of severe disablement allowance applicants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the regulations before the Committee are fair in principle and will help to simplify the medical test arrangements and to focus resources on the severely disabled, for whom severe disablement allowance was always primarily intended. I commend the Regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.39 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Rooney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have learnt in recent years that whenever the Government use the word "target" in relation to benefits they want to limit the number of people entitled to them. We need to view the regulations in light of that and other evidence. We welcome any moves to simplify the complex medical arrangements for benefits, especially where those medicals overlap. We do, however, have several concerns about items in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am intrigued as to what the medical advice is—who it is from and where it has been published—to doubt the passporting criteria in relation to the 80 per cent. disablement test. We must bear in mind recent discussions between the Department and others on such medical evidence in relation to war pensions, because doubt has been cast on Government statements on that. I am interested to know where the evidence is and where it comes from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
We welcome continuation of higher rate DLA care component as a passport to the benefit. I am not particularly concerned about the removal of middle rate DLA care, but I ask for that to be kept under review, especially as classes of people in receipt of middle rate are only on it because of drugs or other treatment that may, for example, sedate them, which means that they do not qualify for the night condition. It may be that some categories of disabled people might need to be reviewed in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having read the evidence submitted by the Government to the Social Security Advisory Committee, I am even less convinced of the need to remove the mobility higher rate. The Government say that the medical evidence required for mobility allowance is self-assessment. That is patently not true. Two thirds of all claims are determined after some form of medical report and more than 25 per cent. after a medical examination. It is not true to say that the benefit is based on self-assessment. Higher rate mobility allowance is an extremely difficult benefit to claim, as anyone who has dealt with constituents will know. I suggest that the toughness of the benefit qualification should be self-evident and that it should qualify as a pass for the all work test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the partially sighted—from whom there are only 200 claims a year—the Royal National Institute for the Blind says that it has no evidence of any partially sighted claimant failing the all work test anywhere in the country. In their evidence to the SSAC, the Government said that the medical evidence required was registration with a local authority. But the medical evidence required is actually a consultant ophthalmologist's report. Are we suggesting that medical examination by a Benefits Agency medical service doctor would be better and more accurate than that by a consultant ophthalmologist? The answer, self-evidently, is no. The requirement to pass the all work test is an inability to read 16-point print at 20 cm. That would mean a person would qualify for the 80 per cent. disablement rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for transitional protection, which is mentioned, I think, in regulation 4, can the Minister clarify what happens to those people who lose their disability living allowance—either mobility or higher care rate—through hospital stay, respite care and so on? Do they have the right to go back to their previous situation where that stay exceeds six weeks? Do they lose the benefit because it could be three or four months before they return? What happens to those who undertake rehabilitative or therapeutic work and find, for whatever reason, that they are not suited to it and want to go back to their earlier circumstances? Do they have the benefit of protection if the period of work is more than eight weeks? If they do not, then it is a disincentive for people trying to maximise their abilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Finally, the estimated savings are £5 million a year, based on some 3,500 people requiring the test and 50 per cent. of them failing, although the Government are generous enough to admit that they have no idea whether all, none, or 50 per cent. will fail. We know from the estimates that were made on incapacity benefit savings that that figure is probably overstated. The number who fail to qualify for incapacity benefit is nothing like the number first suggested by the Government. To stop the partially sighted and others being automatically passported to this benefit, for a saving of £5 million in two years' time, seems mean minded, narrow minded and not worth the effort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still worried by what the Minister said—that partially sighted people may not necessarily have to go for the all work test because an adjudicator can so determine. I am sure that many Committee members would like to know what that number is likely to be and how many people will now have to go through the third test, bearing in mind that, in my experience, there are already serious logjam problems with the all work test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rather soon to start burdening the all work test bureaucracy further when there is no need to do so. From speaking to constituents who have been through the mill, I know that the test is a humiliating experience. It is also time-consuming and causes inconvenience to people who need to be taken for the all work test, because it means that their loved ones must have time off work—and all because the all work test office is overworked. Yet here we are, finding more work for it to do. How many people does the Minister estimate will have to go for the third test?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.47 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a short but interesting debate. The hon. Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney) will find the answers to many of the points that he raised when he considers my opening remarks in detail. But I shall try to answer the points that he and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie) made. I undertake to both hon. Gentlemen that if I am unable to answer all their points, I shall write to them with a detailed answer and place the letter in the Library.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question that the hon. Member for Bradford, North asked was where the medical advice came from. The medical advice came from the chief medical adviser to the Department of Social Security and his team, and is based extensively on operational experience in the field. The hon. Gentleman's second point was about the removal of the middle rate of care. He said that he was not especially worried about that but was anxious that the matter be kept under review. I can give him an undertaking that the matter will be kept under careful review, and I am grateful to him for supporting the principle behind the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's third question was why we are removing the mobility components of disability living allowance as a passport. The disability living allowance mobility component is the successor to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
mobility allowance, recipients of which had to pass a medical examination that was considered to equate to 80 per cent. disablement. However, since the introduction of disability living allowance, some higher rate mobility component beneficiaries will have been awarded benefit following self-assessment rather than a medical assessment. While recipients of the old mobility allowance could be considered 80 per cent. disabled, and we carried that principle through to its successor—the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance—we believe that it can no longer be sustained. Eligibility for disability living allowance depends on the effects of, rather than measurements of, disability. That means that people with exactly the same level of disability can qualify for different levels of disability living allowance depending on how they have adapted to their disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's fourth point—also made by the hon. Member for Heeley—was to ask why we were removing the passport for partially sighted people. We cannot be sure that people who could be registered as partially sighted would be found to be 80 per cent. disabled. We have a duty to be consistent and fair to all disabled people. The statutory definition of blindness is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person should be so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eyesight is essential".</p></blockquote>
Partial sightness is not defined in legislation but, by inference, must be something less disabling than that. The criteria for partial sightedness are set out in guidance to certifying ophthalmic medical practitioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement for registration as partially sighted is either vision of 6/60 or worse in both eyes—which approximates to 80 per cent. disablement—or visual acuity between 6/60 and normal, but with restricted visual fields. The latter requirement often does not equate to 80 per cent. disablement and might be found in glaucoma or the eye complications of diabetes mellitus. The criteria are widely drawn and ophthalmic consultants use considerable clinical discretion in applying them. It does not follow that such people will invariably satisfy the 80 per cent. disablement test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor does it follow that such people would need to be examined if the adjudicating medical authority was satisfied by paper evidence that they would meet the 80 per cent. disablement test. Removal of the passport means that each case can be medically assessed by the adjudicating medical authority on the specific medical circumstances that pertain to each individual.

On the point about transitional protection for those undertaking therapeutic work, I can tell both hon. Members that severe disablement allowance claimants who undertake work deemed to be therapeutic will remain in receipt of benefit.

The hon. Member for Bradford, North made a final point about savings, questioning whether savings figures that he had been given were likely to be accurate. I must underline the point that I made in my opening remarks: we are bringing the order before the House because we believe it right, proper and consistent. There will be significant savings to individuals who will not have to go through both tests,
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
a point which bothered the hon. Member for Heeley. I hope that that hon. Gentlemen will agree that we have introduced the order to get the detail right in the light of experience and to make simplifications fairly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that anything that he did not fully clarify would be sent to us by letter, but the Committee is meant to scrutinise legislation. Enough manky legislation goes through this place already, but how can we scrutinise the order if we do not have the full facts and percentages that I asked for? A letter after the Committee will be too late. The situation may be even worse than I expect—it could be better, but I doubt it—and there is therefore no reason for us to support the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.53 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely reject those comments. The hon. Gentleman asked me a very detailed question about passporting for partially sighted people, and the Committee will accept that I have given an extremely detailed response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.54 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the Minister has failed to convince us on the points that we have raised. I do not know where the definition of partially sighted that he is bandying around came from. As I understand it, to be registered as partially sighted, a person must be certified by a consultant ophthalmologist as being substantially and permanently handicapped as a result of defective vision caused by congenital defect, illness or injury. That is a harsh definition, and that harshness is why there has always been an automatic passport to 80 per cent. Nothing the Minister has said has convinced us that that should change.

Similarly, two-thirds of cases adjudicated for disability living allowance or higher rate mobility in 1995–96 involved some form of medical evidence, including a medical. It is well known that disability living allowance was in such a mess in its early days, and the backlog of cases was so great, that an instruction was given that unless it was obvious that a claim should fail, it should be approved. Two years later, when those claims came up for renewal, the assessment was much more rigorous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A substantial majority of those who receive higher rate mobility have to undergo some medical test to get the benefit. Many of those who do not are so badly disabled that it is painfully obvious—even to an adjudication officer—that they qualify for the benefit. The Minister's estimation is that 3,500 people will be affected. Up to 50 per cent. of them may fail the test—which may mean a saving of £5 million in two years' time. To do that to partially sighted people and people in receipt of higher rate mobility allowance is just nonsense. There is no merit in a Ministry causing such hurt and heartache just to make alleged savings of £250,000. I cannot believe that, in this day and age, we should legislate in such a way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
