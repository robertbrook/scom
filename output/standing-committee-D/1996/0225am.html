<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I and my colleagues welcome you, Mr. Anderson, to our proceedings this morning.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
[<i>Interruption</i>]. The Minister would like to be included in our good wishes.<br><br>
The amendments stress the importance that we attach to ensuring that the proposals for piloting, which form the principal changes in the Bill, are subject to proper evaluation; that the pilots that are approved by the Secretary of State are relevant to deficiencies and problems in services; and that there is an opportunity to scrutinise the quality of pilots and the benefits that derive from them. We hope to set out the case for systematic and proper evaluation.<br><br>
The success of pilots must be judged against clear benchmarks. For example, will they take account of service shortages, will they achieve improved quality of care and will that improved quality, as judged by those working in the pilot to deliver those services, be recognised by patients?<br><br>
The importance of examining the problems that are endemic in delivering consistency in primary care were clearly set out in the Government's White Paper "Choice and Opportunity", which recognised that
<br><blockquote><p>"although generally good, the quality of service for some patient groups and in some areas is not always high. New ways need to be found to address these problems, some of which are long standing".</p></blockquote>
That creates the justification for piloting as the approach to be adopted. The White Paper went on to observe:
<br><blockquote><p>"the rewards and incentives of the single national contract do not always have a clear link to the services required to meet local need or circumstances…similarly, the contract does not always promote the team approach often needed in primary care…fundholding and the move towards a Primary Care led NHS has placed wider responsibilities on GPs as well as offering wider opportunities."</p></blockquote>
It is important to record that fundholding has never been subject to systematic evaluation. The only assessment of fundholding was conducted by the Audit Commission, which made what was very much a mixed report.<br><br>
In making the case for wider contractual choice, "Choice and Opportunity" continues
<br><blockquote><p>"the traditional structure of general practice based on partnerships, personal investment and long term commitments does not always meet the different needs or aspirations of existing, or possible future, GPs. Career breaks, part time working and changes in career or location are becoming increasingly common features and, alongside problems of GP recruitment in some areas, are challenging traditional models."</p></blockquote>
We more or less accept that analysis of the framework and the fact that piloting is a way to deal with some of those intractable problems.<br><br>
We hope that the Minister will respond to our suggestions in the spirit of consensus. The need for good, systematic evaluation and for the Bill to recognise the importance of evaluation are not party political issues that divide us. The Minister in another place made it clear that she recognised that evaluation was an extremely important step in validating the pilots and assessing their long-term prospects.<br><br>
The development of innovation through pilot schemes is a bold way to promote diversity, flexibility and new approaches to some of the intractable problems that we have identified in the consistent
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0509">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
development of high-quality primary care. Opposition Members do not need to remind the Minister of the unacceptable variations in doctoring and the achievement—or, in many parts of the country, the underachievement—of, for example, even the most basic targets for immunisation and cervical screening. The Minister will agree that there is a correlation between the poverty of patients on a GP's list and the quality of a general practice. I do not suggest that patients who live in deprived parts of inner cities are necessarily treated by poor GPs. However, GPs often operate in extremely difficult circumstances, which makes it hard to provide a comprehensive service and to reach the immunisation and screening targets. That matter was established in response to a succession of parliamentary questions that I tabled.<br><br>
No new national innovation should worsen the situation. It is reasonable to assume that the purpose of piloting is to reduce some of those inequalities. It is essential to improve the national standard of the national health service. The pilot scheme should not create further fragmentation. Some parts of the NHS have been reduced to little more than a geographical lottery. A health service that is national should acknowledge the importance of striking a balance between a national framework of guaranteed standards of care and local flexibility and diversity to meet local needs. The trade-off for innovation cannot be the collapse of clear, national standards of entitlement.<br><br>
A failure to establish clear criteria and to write the importance of evaluation into the Bill will diminish the value of pilots if they are assessed only vaguely against criteria that are established from the start. That was made clear in "Choice and Opportunity", which I have already mentioned. That White Paper also made it clear that the Secretary of State would not approve any pilot that did not make its benefits clear.<br><br>
Amendment No. 55 seeks to ensure that the evaluation and review of pilots is carried out according to criteria that are nationally defined and responsive to local schemes. That would strike the proper balance and establish the failure or ineffectiveness of a new approach.<br><br>
The Minister's listening exercises—"Choice and Opportunity" and Primary Care: Delivering The Future"—set out a number of good starting points, which could link with the analysis of the shortcomings of primary care set out in the document. The Minister set out five characteristics of primary care: quality, fairness, accessibility, responsiveness and efficiency. We on the Opposition Benches would add a sixth characteristic: equity, which is lacking in so many aspects of the national health service.<br><br>
If pilots are to be at the leading edge of new ideas, with the intention that their good lessons and their experience then be rolled out everywhere, we have to know not only what works but the circumstances in which success can be assured. No one would support the national health service becoming a multitude of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
local experiments—800 or 1,000, whatever the limit on the number of pilots might be.<br><br>
Research and development bodies outside the House recognise the difficulty of such development and of the replication of initiatives from test-bed to generalisation throughout the service. One must understand, for instance, the significance in a specific locality of the hero or heroine innovator and separate the impact of that contribution from other factors. Without systematic evaluation, that becomes impossible. The health service has been denied much of the virtue of the great innovations in service development in various parts of the country because there has not been systematic evaluation of those developments and the knowledge has not been disseminated.<br><br>
If a national framework for evaluation does not exist, the pilot is the property only of its locality, and does not contribute to a broader understanding of how to strengthen primary care across the whole of the national health service. Given that we all support the drive for evidence-based medicine, surely evidence-based policy-making is an essential corresponding discipline.<br><br>
It is the Committee's purpose not to draft criteria but to set a broad framework of national criteria. Local criteria would be developed on a case-by-case basis and submitted as part of the bid to the Secretary of State. Before any pilot is approved by the Secretary of State, the means by which it is to be evaluated should be clearly established.<br><br>
To touch on two other issues raised by this group of pilots—I mean amendments; these are not piloted amendments but tabled amendments—there is a problem if there is no proper framework within which to evaluate innovation as it unrolls. Amendment No. 50 sets a minimum length for pilots, and amendment No. 110 is probably overtaken by Government amendment No. 149, which sets out the maximum length for pilots. We welcome the fact that we have been able to reach agreement that pilots should have a maximum length.<br><br>
I hope that the case for evaluation is compelling and that we do not need to enagage in too long a debate about whether it is desirable. I hope that, in the spirit of consensus, the Minister can help us make progress on that important point because it is essential that those who will be responsible for implementing the legislation—if it receives Royal Assent—feel confident about its competence. We believe that failure to include evaluation of pilot initiatives will severely compromise that confidence.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
I should be grateful if the Minister, when he responds to the debate, would say how many pilots he expects to be launched as part of the programme. In another place, the Minister made it clear that the Government proposed to set up a national representative group to oversee the operation of the pilot. If that is to be a competent group, doing its job properly, we would expect it to insist on national
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0510">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
criteria for evaluation, as well as local criteria to be developed on a case-by-case basis. Given the pressures on the Department's research and development budget, it would be helpful if the Minister gave us some idea of the resources that have been made available for evaluation and the important development and dissemination exercise that will follow from the initial period of innovation. This is an extremely important set of amendments. We do not believe that they are contentious, and I look forward to receiving the Minister's reassurances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mr. Gerald Malone)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I formally—not from a sedentary position—welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Anderson.<br><br>
The hon. Lady is right to emphasise the importance of the issues dealt with in the amendments. I can confirm to her, in a spirit of consensus, that I have no problem with the principles that she outlined, but I shall try to persuade her that the means of achieving them, through the amendments, is unnecessary. Let me set out the Government's position.<br><br>
In the White Paper, "Choice and Opportunity", from which the Bill is derived, we made it clear that piloting was about better ways of delivering better services. That has always been the case and I am grateful to the hon. Lady for mentioning it. There is, frankly, little point in a scheme if it does not bring benefits to patients, but I part company slightly with the hon. Lady on one issue. She focused, understandably, on the question of dealing with deficiencies in the existing service. Although that is an important component of what we are doing, there is a second important point; not only do we have in place legislation designed to meet deficiencies but we have before the Committee legislation that is designed to improve existing services and to allow innovation to be brought to bear to build on what are already acknowledged to be excellent primary care services.<br><br>
The Government are familiar with the principle—one example is the primary care proposals that have been successful in London with the London initiative zone—of recognising that specific deficiencies must be corrected by the specific application of policy. The hon. Lady seeks reassurance that one can achieve benefits by setting a policy in train. That can be done without resorting to writing the detail into primary legislation.<br><br>
In reviewing pilots, we shall look first at the extent to which they have achieved their objectives. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will certainly want to set out the ground rules for evaluation—possibly in some detail. Some sort of framework is essential if we are to have consistent standards of evaluation. When we get further into the Bill and discuss clause 5, the hon. Lady will find that it gives my right hon. Friend powers to determine procedures for review. It may then be appropriate to set her mind at rest in respect of the procedures that we have put in hand to ensure that evaluation criteria are properly developed. Before trying to set that criteria in legislation, I remind the hon. Lady that throughout the procedure the Government have always told the professionals involved in the delivery of primary health care and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
other interested parties that, as the matter develops, there will be a process of continuing consultation.<br><br>
We started the procedure with a listening exercise and we are developing criteria with a range of healthcare professionals to ensure that what we are doing is directly relevant to what they are delivering. I suggest to the hon. Lady that setting matters in stone in the Bill may not be entirely sensible. The national consultative group is now expressing its views. It needed a clearer view of the framework for evaluation and wants to develop its work on that. There is now a sub-group of the consultative group and I hope that we shall have the opportunity later in our debate to talk more about the framework of general consultation. I shall confine myself now to the amendments before us.<br><br>
The sub-group of the national consultative group has already been set up and is led by Professor Martin Rowland, a professor of general practice at the Manchester primary care research centre. That resulted from the view, which it rightly identified, as did the hon. Lady, that it is an important area in which to carry out work. The sub-group will report to the national consultative group at the next meeting on 10 March. We shall listen to what it says and the discussion with it will continue. We shall also seek wider views on its proposals before establishing the framework for the evaluation of the proposed pilot schemes.<br><br>
In essence, I suggest to the Committee that although there is common ground on the importance of the matter, I hope that the hon. Lady understands that if the evolutionary process which was put in hand with the primary care listening exercise, the White Paper "Choice and Opportunity" and all the matters on which the Bill and the process is based is to continue, it would be contradictory to set the matter in stone in the statute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder why the Minister seems to have made no case for rejecting amendment No. 14. He has referred repeatedly to evaluation and the Secretary of State said in the House that
<br><blockquote><p>"Pilots will be monitored and the results will be evaluated."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 15 October 1996; Vol. 282, c. 590.]</p></blockquote>
All that we are asking in the amendment is for that to be in the Bill. What is so alarming about that? If the White Paper refers to pilots being evaluated, why does the Minister not want that to be in the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that. I owe the hon. Member for Dulwich (Ms Jowell) an explanation of why it would not be appropriate to write the matter into the Bill and I want to give some illustrations. It is rather far-fetched to suggest that any health professionals and health authorities, which will put the proposals together, will omit such basic information. What is more important is that the problems should be set out in the right way by those on the ground. I hope that the Committee recognises that many different problems occur in many different localities. The hon. Lady, quite rightly, referred to the problem of deficiencies in primary care services.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0511">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
There will be a great difference between the deficiencies that some may perceive in primary care facilities in an inner-city area—which is perhaps provided by outdated practices in outdated premises—and the problems, which will be equally recognised and put forward with considerable vigour, by those in rural areas.<br><br>
If we set out anything in detail in the Bill that would fail to encompass a lot of what is perceived in the primary health care world, we could limit the issues that could be addressed under evaluation. That would be regrettable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Tony Wright <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a spirit of consensus and all the rest of it, I am having trouble in being persuaded by the Minister. For the life of me, I do not understand what impediment or obstruction would be placed on any development if it simply specified that there should be a clear evaluation criteria. It would not specify particular ones in detail: it would state that there should be a clear identification of the problem to be addressed and against which evaluation should take place. What on earth is the impediment to any development if something as simple and straightfoward as that is included in the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we return to the conundrum that so often happens in Committees: the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that we include something meaningless in the Bill. I do not know what "clear criteria" would mean, unless it were specified further. The role of primary legislation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Heppell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I finish the first intervention, before I deal with the hon. Gentleman's enthusiasm? Of course there should be an obligation to evaluate. That is not a matter of dispute. Dispute is the process that would underpin and define that evaluation. It is pointless to discuss whether to include in the legislation a meaningless requirement, but it is something that we hear frequently from the Opposition. They say that we should include amendments that would be unenforceable and of little meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heppell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I give the Minister an example of where it might be helpful to have a criterion? At present across the country we have 12 pilot schemes for head injuries. They are due to finish in March. The evaluation of those schemes is not expected until the autumn. Therefore, no health authority can make an assessment about whether to carry on with the pilot schemes until then. Would not a criterion stop such a problem, by stating when the schemes would have to report on the evaluation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman shoots his own fox, if I may use that rather politically-incorrect analogy. In exactly such a situation, it is extremely important that matters are dealt with by the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
professionals who have a far clearer insight than we may have as legislators. They know what should apply to the very different sets of evaluation that will happen to the very different sets of pilot schemes. If there were to be one standard pilot scheme, covering all circumstances, I might say to the hon. Member for Dulwich and her colleagues that there might be a point. The truth is that we are discussing the stuff of detailed operating rules and we have taken great care to continue the principle and to ensure that that aspect will be dealt with by the national consultative committee, which is wide-ranging.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It still seems curious because I am obviously in favour of the flexibility of which the Minister speaks in relation to the different pilots that would arise. What is common to them all is that they will be evaluated. That does not impose a limit on pilots. We must be able to evaluate them. The Minister cannot be correct in suggesting that if we were to accept the amendment, we would limit the schemes. The evidence shows that those professionals involved in pilots want them evaluated. It may be that limits might make life difficult and the schemes less flexible, but surely whatever the scheme, the Secretary of State, the White Paper and the Minister have said that it will be evaluated. I do not understand how being more specific in the Bill would be restrictive.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman intervenes at an appropriate point because he anticipates my next remarks to illustrate why selecting one criterion is unwise. If one particular matter, for example, evaluation, were included in the Bill, it would be raised to unmerited importance in comparison with a range of other matters that would not be included. I understand that the hon. Member for Dulwich and other members of the Committee want a firm declaration from the Government of our intentions on how we will carry the schemes forward in cooperation with the profession in an evolutionary process. That answers the hon. Gentleman's question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that many other alternatives could be written into the Bill. Will he give the Committee examples of alternatives that would limit schemes in the way that the word "evaluation" limits schemes? I do not know what the Minister understands by that word, but I believe it to mean that a review will examine what is going on and will compare that with the criteria set out for a scheme. I thought that that was its meaning in the White Paper and in the Secretary of State's statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not terribly sure that we are arguing about a difference. Clearly, evaluation is going to take place; a process is under way and the mechanisms in the Bill set out how that will happen. I was arguing that elevating one particular matter to primary legislation would not necessarily be helpful. There is no doubt that when we come to evaluate pilot schemes we will want to look hard at the quality of the service provided, but equally we will want to consider
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0512">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
other issues. Including evaluation in the restrictive imperative way set out in the amendments would not be helpful. Many considerations, such as value for money, will be valid and will be examined by those developing the criteria.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is important—even more so since the Minister told us that the criteria of evaluation is meaningless. He mentioned professional bodies and their desire for flexibility. Is not it the case that professional bodies have asked for the criteria of evaluation to be made explicit in the Bill? Can he give one concrete example of a pilot scheme that will be prevented or impeded in any way by including in the Bill something about the criteria of evaluation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It depends how one writes the criteria in the Bill. That is obvious. I am not sure from what point of the compass Opposition Members are coming. They are varying their arguments: on the one hand they talk about writing the criteria individually in the Bill but on the other they suggest that we need a statutory commitment to the process of evaluation. The two are different. I differed entirely from Opposition Members when they suggested that we should put in place criteria by which evaluation should occur, while I am at one with them on other matters. The basic obligation of having evaluation as a process is already built into the Bill. I remind the Committee what I said a few moments ago about clause 5, which provides that the Secretary of State will determine evaluation procedures. Health authority proposals for evaluation will flow from those procedures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister is forgetting when he says that it would be destructive rather than helpful to have evaluation written into the Bill is that the Bill deals with pilot schemes. There is no point to such schemes unless they are evaluated against set criteria. Surely the Minister cannot start commending to the medical and other professions evidence-based medicine and dentistry unless he is willing to set up the Bill's structure so that it is evidence-based legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has clearly been reading more than he has been listening this morning. For his benefit I shall repeat the points that he has missed. First, the obligation in respect of evaluation is clearly set out elsewhere in the Bill. Secondly, that process of evaluation, as I have pointed out, is being continued with the national consultative committee so that we can set the criteria. As we are developing criteria in concert with the cross-section of people who provide primary care, it would be extraordinary if we as a Committee pre-empted and prejudged what those people are considering and suddenly came up with proposals for criteria that were set in concrete.<br><br>
I am not certain whether there is much between us on the matter. The hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Dr. Wright) seemed to be more interested in receiving an assurance of a firm commitment to the principle of evaluation. I can tell him that that is written in the Bill. Another very different question
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
concerns how much detail we need to ensure that the proposal will be properly developed. I suggest respectfully to the Committee that, although we may think that we are good at writing legislation and shaping amendments that endure for all time, our commonsense experience of primary care tells us—I am sure that the experiences of all Committee members about what happens in their constituencies would confirm my point—that experiences are different and, therefore, it is inappropriate to set in place a rigid set of criteria. However, I assure the Committee that the process of evaluation is not only anticipated but is firmly included in the Bill's provisions.<br><br>
I conclude my remarks by saying that there are many other factors, such as the impact of the scheme on other NHS services and other providers. We need thoroughly to consider all possible evaluation criteria before making the rules, instead of picking and choosing issues for inclusion in the Bill. No matter how innovative the Committee might be an anticipating what may happen in primary care across the country, the reality will prove different and we would risk setting in place a straitjacket—which is precisely the opposite of our intentions with the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note that the Minister said that procedure for evaluation was to be included in the Bill. However, "evaluation" is not there. Instead we have provision for a "review".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In clause 5. I think that an evaluation implies more consideration than a review. A review does not necessarily require the same depth of consideration. That is why it would be sensible, in conjunction with the amendments that we have proposed on how pilots should run for a minimum time—after all, the schemes will go ahead and it is up to the electorate to decide who will have responsibility for them—to let people know that it will be a serious review. That is why "evaluation" would mean a little more—after all, it was the word originally used by the Secretary of State when he introduced the measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my experience, the hon. Gentleman frequently resorts to matters that can normally be resolved by reference to the larger version of the Oxford English Dictionary—what means what and which word is synonymous with this, that and the next thing. Clause 5, which gives the Secretary of State broad powers for review, is the clause about which is centred the process for evaluation. It would be a mistake to narrow the terms that the Secretary of State can consider, but I reassure the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) that clause 5 underpins the process. I maintain that it is better that the process be decided elsewhere among those who continue, in a consultative way, to develop the criteria. As the process continues—as it will for a considerable time—such people might consider that it would be unfortunate, to say the least, if, having set out a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0513">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
number of criteria for evaluation, they could not revise their opinions about how criteria should be shaped. Of course, we will examine carefully the continuing advice that we receive from all those whom we consult about how the on-going process should be continued.<br><br>
I strongly suggest that the principle exists and that it would be unwise to stultify the process in any way or to set matters in stone before the national committee has formed more than tentative opinions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kevin Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Doncaster, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can see some of the merits in the Minister's argument about having sets of criteria laid down in the Bill, but I do not understand his argument against amendment No. 14, which does not mention criteria. All that it states is, "and its subsequent evaluation". That seems pretty clear to me. With which part of amendment No. 14 is the Minister having problems?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have told the Committee before, the amendment is unnecessary. Opposition Members cannot seem to decide whether they want the principle of evaluation to be set out and enshrined in the Bill. The hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) might take issue with the interpretation of language, but the principle is firmly set out in clause 5. If it is a matter of principle that the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes) raises, why repeat the principle in another unnecessary clause? That would cause confusion and, in terms of interpretation, would conflict with the provisions of clause 5 and the Secretary of State's duties to review. Although we are happy to be probed on such points in Committee, we do not want to include any unnecessary legislation on the statute book.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dulwich raised a number of specific points. It is impossible for the Government to answer her question about the number of pilots for the simple reason that, as the hon. Lady knows, the voluntary principle is written into the Bill. Of course, we want volunteers to come forward with proposals and if the proposals meet all our criteria and, in particular, offer benefits to patients, we will want to allow them to go ahead. However, it is in the very nature of piloting that there might be a rather modest start to the initiative. We will aim to build on that start by learning from experience. It would, perhaps, be unhelpful were I to suggest any figure to the hon. Lady because, frankly, as the process is voluntarily driven, it would be rather curious were I to come to Committee with a preconceived opinion about numbers of pilots.<br><br>
Following the publication of our proposals, through the White Paper and now the Bill, substantial interest has been expressed not only by individual practices across Britain, but from professional groups and organisations. Indeed, one of the things I have found most heartening is that representatives from a range of professions—who often come seeking assurances about the meaning of the Bill and whether it presents them with opportunities—have suggested
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
amendments in a spirit of enthusiasm. Indeed, in some cases, their amendments resemble those tabled by the Opposition. Those representatives want greater participation in the opportunities that will before them. I expect there to be a broad range of pilots, which will be brought together by many healthcare professionals, and I expect the initiative to be successful. I hope that the hon. Lady understands that I cannot put a figure to the matter. I have no lower or upper figures.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dulwich asked about resources for evaluation. We do not know how many pilots are likely to be involved, and it is extremely difficult to anticipate the resources that will be required. I must make it clear—</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley <span class='memberconstituency'>(York)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister cannot say how many pilots will be involved, we are left debating the matter in the dark. The estimate of academics with whom I have discussed the matter is that 800 pilots will be involved. It that a gross overestimate or a gross underestimate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no idea: that is the estimate of academics. The hon. Gentleman frequently presents himself as an academic; maybe he should predict whether the figure is right or not. I simply do not know. The answer is that schemes will be proposed and evaluated on their merits. If people meet the criteria, they will be encouraged to go ahead. I return the hon. Gentleman's question to him. What figure would he like? It is impossible to settle on an ideal figure for a voluntary principle. If he has discussed the matter with academics, perhaps he will share with us the evidence on which they base their estimate—it is news to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Eight hundred pilots would mean eight pilots per English health authority. Does the Minister think that that is an overestimate or an underestimate? The Minister laughs, but this is a serious point. Academics, too, are working in the dark to evaluate the policy. We do not know whether 30 or 40 pilots will be involved; if that many were involved, most health authorities would not be touched by the piloting exercise. The Minister shakes his head. Does that mean that there will be many more pilots?<br><br>
I have another question for the Minister. Irrespective of the number of pilots, what does he expect the average cost of evaluating a pilot to be? What resources will be allocated for that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that he is rather mischievously asking questions about matters to which we cannot at present put figures.<br><br>
I shall return to his first point, from which he has rather wisely tried to steer us. He seemed to suggest that we should set criteria and consider how the scheme should develop nationally. We have developed our proposals on the basis of the individual projects that we have examined. It is not a question of a certain number. The performance of individual
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0514">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
pilots will determine whether they proceed. It is not for the Bill to say whether 800 or only 30 or 40 pilots will be involved. It should state what the merits of a successful pilot are.<br><br>
To satisfy the hon. Gentleman's curiosity, I shall dare to go as far as I feel able to do. If there were, as he suggested, such a widespread and universal desire across the country to bring forward pilot proposals, I should in principle welcome that. It would be helpful to see a range of pilots in a wide range of geographical settings.<br><br>
As for the hon. Gentleman's second point—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer the hon. Gentleman's second point before he makes his third one. His second point was whether we envisaged setting a precise budget for the evaluation of single pilots. Clearly, the answer is no. Only when the criteria have been developed will we be able to consider specific figures, as the hon. Gentleman suggests. But there will be a sufficiency of resource to meet the needs of proper evaluation, and I am happy to confirm that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I be clear about this? I believe the Minister told the Committee that if there were 800 pilots, he would welcome them because it would show enthusiasm for the scheme. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, perhaps the Minister would clarify what he said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should read the record again. He is mischievously trying to get me to hang my coat on a particular hook, which I shall not. I clearly said that if 800 pilots were submitted, I would welcome such a broad spectrum from such a wide geographical area. That would be good news. If the news were that no pilots were proposed, I would be disappointed.<br><br>
I make no suggestion of what would be a proper upper limit or disappointing lower limit. As the process is driven not by health authorities or Ministers but by those on the ground, who wish voluntarily to put together proposals to bring to the Secretary of State, it would be entirely inappropriate for me to set a target. I very much welcome the fact that such a broad range of interest has already been demonstrated on the ground, as well as by academics, with whom the hon. Gentleman may be more familiar.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to my feet. I put one other point to the Minister about his estimate of the cost of thoroughly and properly evaluating a pilot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There cannot be any upper or lower limit for the simple reason that a pilot may cover a minor change in service, may provide delivery of the same service but by a different means or may propose a radical approach. Clearly, the different sorts of pilot submitted for evaluation will bring with them a separate cost, and it would be pointless to grade them A, B or C and to allocate specific sums for evaluation of certain pilots.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
As we proceed, evaluation may become more repetitive and familiar as pilots perhaps duplicate each other. It may become possible, therefore, for the evaluation process to build on work that has been done before and so become less costly. I do not see the point in trying to determine an average figure for something that is entirely unquantifiable, and which will develop and change over time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give way, I hope for the last time on this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is extremely kind. The reason for my asking the question is this. The Government are proposing the first piece of legislation on primary care since the beginning of the NHS. They propose that new schemes should be piloted before they are incorporated into primary care, so that those schemes that do not work can be discarded. A great deal of research and evaluation will be necessary. I seek reassurance that the necessary resources will be made available to the NHS research budget so that it need not cut other programmes, such as research into BSE.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sufficient resources will be devoted to evaluation. We all know perfectly well what would have happened if I had set a figure: the hon. Member for York would have said that 800 academics thought it was not enough. I understand the arguments that the hon. Gentleman is deploying to test the Government but reassure him that sufficient resources will be made available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for York may say that it is not enough, but the Labour party is not in a position to say how much it would spend if it were in power.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a telling point, which I hope conclusively wraps up this part of the debate. Perhaps, I may move on to Government amendment No. 149.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Dulwich for acknowledging that the amendment delivers on our commitment in another place to impose a three-year limit on pilot schemes from the time of coming into operation to evaluation. I hope that the Committee welcomes that. I shall touch, however, on the parallel point of setting a minimum length of time for all schemes. If the hon. Member for York were to press me on the number of academics who have said that 18 months was not an unreasonable period for a pilot scheme to run, I would be prepared to hang my coat on a certain hook and say that that was not a bad idea. Any commonsense approach would accept that running through an annual cycle with an additional period is what might normally be expected, but I do not set that down as a firm criterion.<br><br>
There are several sensible reasons for that. It would be wrong of the Committee, especially as we are discussing an evolutionary process, to rule out the possibility of schemes that are only subtly different from current arrangements or from ways of working
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0515">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
that are well established in other areas of the health service. In another argument I said that, in some pilots, there might be no change in the provision of services to patients but, rather, a change in the way in which general practitioners and other healthcare professionals might choose to provide them. That would be sufficient for a pilot, but it need not take as long to evaluate as more fundamental schemes.<br><br>
I return to my further point: as other arrangements come forward—perhaps in 12 months' time while others are encouraged, as part of the cohort 800 referred to by the hon. Member for York, to introduce proposals based on the success of other schemes—there will be much duplication in the way in which arrangements are shaped, and the evaluation of certain models may make it far easier to establish other pilots during the process. I concede that there needs to be an upper limit, otherwise pilots may extend to the indefinite future, which would be undesirable and which is why amendment No. 149 introduces a cut-off point of three years. However, it would be wrong to include that in the Bill in another way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government have a dreadful record on pilot schemes. On several occasions they have introduced measures as pilot schemes which they have implemented on a wider scale before the pilots have finished. The Minister's right hon. and hon. Friends in the Department for Education and Employment have been guilty of that. In setting a minimum, the professionals involved in the schemes would be given time to prove themselves and to adjust a scheme if it was not correct. I am concerned about the over-hasty acceptance of pilots by other branches of government. Although I do not expect the Minister to have a Conservative successor, I would be uncertain as to whether some of his present colleagues—not those in the Committee—would dispense with the need to review and okay things that they thought reasonable if they found themselves in his job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have three things to say to the hon. Gentleman about that. The first is that the criteria for evaluation, as we have often said in connection with other amendments in this group, will be set out by the national consultative group. It will not be a simple case of ticking a box and passing it through. The national consultative group will set out serious criteria by which all pilots should be evaluated, which means that there must be a proper period of time within which that should be done. It would not be wise to set a minimum statutory period because—for a whole range of reasons which I have already explained to the Committee—it may well be possible to study certain schemes that are repetitive or minor within a much shorter time scale.<br><br>
My second point is that, in suggesting that the arrangements would be rushed through in some way, the hon. Gentleman is forgetting the voluntary principle. If the healthcare professionals entering into the pilots thought them an inappropriate way in which to assess a scheme or to provide care in the long term,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
they would be at perfect liberty to withdraw at any time and say that that was not the right way in which to proceed.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
My third point is my most compelling. I have a nightmare vision of what may happen 12 months' hence, when I am still Minister for Health and the hon. Gentleman, having secured an Adjournment debate in the House, criticises my standing in the way of an excellent proposal that has come forward from his constituency for evaluation. If the time limit appears in the Bill, we shall have to wait 18 months. The hon. Gentleman, who always pursues constituency matters vigorously, will no doubt have been told by the doctors and nurses that they could have got on with the proposal if only the Minister in the previous Parliament had not included an absurd 18-month minimum time limit in the Bill. I know how powerfully the hon. Gentleman puts forward his arguments, and it is largely because I do not want to have to face such a scenario during the next Parliament that I feel compelled to resist his blandishments this morning.<br><br>
I hope that I have explained to the Committee why, although I quite concede the points and principles that the hon. Member for Dulwich and her hon. Friends have made during this important debate, which has provided me with a welcome opportunity to set out the Government's thinking in the <i>Official Report.</i> I hope that the Committee will agree that the Opposition amendments should perhaps be withdrawn because the spirit in which the Bill is going forward confirms the principles that they are intended to underpin. I urge the Committee to support Government amendment No. 149.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should start by thanking the Minister for engaging in real debate and for allowing us to intervene and press questions. I should also like to thank him for helping me realise how important it is to include the need for evaluation in the Bill—he has been quite an eloquent advocate for the amendments of my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich, in fact.<br><br>
I should like to share with the Committee a reflection on the history of the evaluation of some of the many NHS reforms under Conservative Governments over recent years. People in the NHS feel punch-drunk with reforms. No sooner have they got through one massive reorganisation, which was supposed to free the NHS from bad practice in the past, than a new one ensues. It is a process of permanent revolution involving changes, some of which would not have been necessary if the Government had seriously evaluated policies before introducing them. Had they done so, they would not have made so many mistakes.<br><br>
I remind the Committee of primary care provision before 1990, under the old GP contract, which was very unspecific and which has been described as a John Wayne contract: "A GP's gotta do what a GP's gotta do." That is quite a good description. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0516">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
contract allowed GPs to determine what being a GP was about. I think that the Government were right to say that since thousands of millions of pounds' -worth of public money were being spent on general practice, the NHS ought to have a say about the purposes for which that money should be used.<br><br>
In 1990, in the face of some acrimony, the Government introduced the new GP contract, which proposed, among other things, the establishment of a core service which all GPs would provide. That core service included, among other things, health checks for new patients within 28 days of coming on to a GP's list, an annual consultation and domiciliary visit for all patients over 75 years old, cervical cytology screening at maximum intervals of five and a half years for all women between the ages of 25 and 64, reaching immunisation and vaccination targets for children, and responsibility for health promotion.<br><br>
Since the Government introduced the new contract, doctors and health economists have asked whether it is cost-effective to require GPs to undertake all those tasks. Had the Government evaluated the cost-effectiveness of those elements of the core service before introducing them, there would have been an answer to that. It is possible that many tasks that GPs are required to undertake by the contract are not cost-effective, that they spend NHS money on things which do not improve the health of their patients. If that is happening, it is a gross misuse of the limited resources available to the NHS.<br><br>
I take it as read that all members of the Committee believe that the intention of the Bill should be to use the resources available to the NHS as cost-effectively as possible. I refer the Minister to a commentary on the new GP contract which was produced by the Centre for Health Economics at York university in 1991—the year after the introduction of the contract. It concluded:
<br><blockquote><p>"Like many of the Government's health care reforms, the new GP contract is … a radical and unproven new policy. Such 'shots in the dark' should be recognised as such and evaluated to inform future policy choices. Without such evaluation the 'next' reform of the GP contract may be based on hope rather than knowledge. No hopes, however sincere and well meant, can substitute for knowledge in the formulation of health care reforms aimed at using scarce NHS resources more efficiently."</p></blockquote>
A radical change was made by the 1990 GP contract. To what extent has a rigorous evaluation been made of whether the services required by the contract are effective in terms of health and the use of limited NHS resources? I do not believe that such an evaluation has been made. Given that an evaluation of the last major shake-up of GP primary care services has not been made, I must conclude that the Government, despite the Minister's recent comments, are not genuinely committed to rigorous evaluation of their policies. They find it politically embarrassing to have the spotlight shone on Conservatives health reforms because, almost inevitably, mistakes as well as successes are found.<br><br>
The Government must be open. We are dealing with thousands of millions of pounds of NHS money and if it is spent on matters that do not improve health, it is wasted—the money is thrown away. The Government
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
must have the courage to evaluate. As they have proved by their record that they do not have the will to do that unless it is a legal requirement, my hon. Friends have reached the correct conclusion that such a requirement must be included in the Bill.<br><br>
GP fundholding—another primary care reform that was introduced by the Government—was also an untried, untested and unproven policy. It was a shot in the dark. It was not piloted and, for years after its introduction, the Government resisted any thorough evaluation of it.<br><br>
At the end of 1985, Jennifer Dixon and Howard Glennerster wrote an article in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> which the Government have used many times as an endorsement of GP fundholding. However, the article said that there had been no rigorous evaluation and, therefore, that its benefits and costs in terms of patient care could not be judged. In summary, the authors said that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The impact of fundholding on transaction costs, equity and quality of care … is unknown".</p></blockquote>
The Audit Commission decided to carry out a thorough study of the costs and benefits of GP fundholding. It was the first time that such a study had been carried out. I applaud the commission for doing that and for standing up to the Department of Health and Ministers by insisting on doing it. I know from people who worked on the study that the Department tried to stop the commission from carrying it out, but the commission persisted. It produced a long and detailed report, which was balanced and fair. The report found that, on the basis of the evaluation that had been carried out to date, no firm conclusion could be drawn on many issues. As accountants, the commission's members evaluated the costs and benefits of fundholding. It found that the costs of introducing fundholding, in terms of increased management, clerical, equipment and computing costs within practices, had been, up to the end of 1994–95—when the report was completed—£232 million. The benefits in efficiency savings made on fundholding budgets was £206 million. In other words, the costs of fundholding were greater than the benefits released from it for patients.<br><br>
In its conclusion the commission made a number of recommendations. It recommended that the NHS executive should
<br><blockquote><p>"tighten … the criteria for entry into the scheme and require practices to show how they meet the scheme's standards … introduce contracts between health authorities and fundholders as a mechanism for making sure that fundholders use the funds efficiently and effectively … introduce either an accreditation system or an inspectorate that would give an independent judgment on practices' suitability to become, and remain, budget holders."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister tell the Committee which of those very direct recommendations, made to the Department of Health by the Audit Commission, have been implemented? Will he also tell us which of those recommendations will be applied to the pilot schemes to be introduced under the Bill?<br><br>
The central problem with the Minister's response to my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich is that a primary care innovation can be evaluated only against a marker such as an alternative scheme providing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0517">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
similar types of care. Otherwise there can be only a commentary on a scheme, and that does not provide the information needed to assess whether the innovation has been an improvement. There has been no commitment from the Minister or the Secretary of State that the pilot schemes will be evaluated rigorously against comparatives of alternative practice. Without that commitment, I am not convinced that any serious, rigorous evaluation will take place. There will be much experimentation and if there are as many as 800 schemes, there will be war-weariness or permanent revolution-weariness in primary care. If the schemes are not rigorously evaluated, the Government will be in no position to pick winners and losers at the end of 18 months or however long the pilot schemes last. We need answers from the Minister.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
Before I move on, perhaps I may refer the Minister to the article on fundholding by Dixon and Glennerster to which he and his hon. Friends on the Front Bench have referred many times. In their summary they state:
<br><blockquote><p>"Although fundholding has been studied more than any other aspect of the NHS reforms, empirical evidence on the impact of the scheme is still lacking. What we can conclude from the published research is limited because either the study designs have not included a control group with which to contrast the experience of fundholders or the control groups later decided to join the scheme".</p></blockquote>
The article, which is used as a benchmark by the Government for justifying fundholding, states that evaluation is not valid unless the innovation is evaluated against existing practice. Is that what the Government intend to do? If that is their intention—I hope that it is—it is not incompatible in any way with what my hon. Friends propose in their amendment. What would be incompatible would be to have the sort of review to which clause 5 refers—it would simply result in a commentary on the pilot scheme and no basis on which to assess whether clinical practice had been improved in terms of patient outcome following the innovation.<br><br>
There are two other matters to which I hope the Minister will respond, although I realise that he has already spoken on the amendments. When evaluation of a pilot study has finished and conclusions have been reached on the aspects of the pilot scheme that are likely to improve patient care and those that fail to improve primary care, how will the results be disseminated to the rest of the service? How will GPs and other primary healthcare workers throughout the NHS be encouraged, persuaded or obliged to use the good innovations and discouraged or dissuaded from using those which are poor and clinically ineffective? What mechanisms of accountability will there be not just for those involved in the pilot schemes, but for those involved more generally in primary care and general practice to require them to do what is good for patients and to persuade them not to do what is bad for patients? Under the new phase of the national health service permanent revolution, if the evaluation takes
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
place, there will be a wealth of information on innovations in primary care which work and aspects of primary care practice which are bad for patients. If the exercise is simply an academic one and someone in the NHS executive has a little folder with an evaluation report stating that a particular scheme benefits A, B and C and disbenefits X, Y and Z, that would not do patients one scrap of good. We need to know that the results will be disseminated and that those people, who are paid by the state from NHS funds and who provide primary healthcare services, will be required to implement the good practice proposals that the evaluation produces.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer some of the questions that the hon. Member for York asked, but I must preface my remarks by saying that his questions applied broadly and to more than the Bill. Much of what he said—in particular about part II arrangements and the new part I arrangements—could effectively apply to primary care as a whole. It would be good if we included in the Bill a provision that referred only to the new arrangements. We have a policy of raising the qualify of primary care with regard to the new part I arrangements and the current part II arrangements. If the hon. Gentleman reads the collected documentation from the listening exercise, including "Choice and Opportunity" and "Primary Care: Delivering the Future", he will see that the Bill is but one component in the wider evolution of primary care as a whole and the improvement of its quality across the country.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman pressed me on the question of research and about how to disseminate best practice across the country. We are, in many ways, in a better position to do that today than we were a few years ago. For example, one of my first and pleasant duties as a Minister was to go to Manchester to inaugurate its primary care research centre. It forms an important part of our overall research and development policy, which is now more rooted in the Department of Health and which can focus on NHS priorities, including primary care. Before then, that centre had been something of a Cinderella with regard to research.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman may be interested to know that the proportion of NHS research and development spending that is relevant to primary care will be doubled in the new programme from 6 or 7 per cent., or £25 million, to 14 or 15 per cent., or £50 million, over the next five years. That rightly reflects trends in patient activity across the country. A group will research the narrow criteria by which we shall judge the suitability of pilots, their impact on the quality of care and the broad pattern of future developments.<br><br>
The hon. Member for York asked, "What are you going to do about that?" He discussed a pilot that was evaluated as having an excellent effect on the health care of the local population and he asked whether we would put the relevant report in a file and tuck it away in a corner of the Department of Health or in a health authority, after which no more would be heard of it. I have two responses to his question. First, the performance of part I arrangements will be assessed during the discussion process, which will occur during the contracting process between the health authority and those providing the pilot scheme. The mechanism
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0518">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
for the current part II arrangements is not always entirely clear. Secondly, a refreshing aspect of primary care—one of its benefits—is the fact that healthcare professionals are keen, in the vast majority of cases, to respond. For example, in London an initiative was put forward by the Government and no one was obliged to comply with it. Opportunities were available and the scheme was explained to GPs by the north and south Thames regional health authorities. The scheme has broadly been a success, funds have been allocated and progress made. We should not be over-cautious; we should not assume that no one will seek out the results or be prepared to implement them. But even if that were so—especially in respect of part I arrangements—I expect health authorities to pick up good examples by informing themselves of the initiative and its progress across the country. In that way they can ensure, through their on-going discussions with those providing primary care, that a framework is established so that best practice does not take place in isolated circumstances but goes further.<br><br>
I also refer the hon. Gentleman to what we have put on record and to what is developing in the health service in terms of quality and effectiveness. He well knows how difficult it is to prepare effectiveness indicators in primary care when dealing with small populations, but he also knows that that is undergoing consistent development. It is important that over time we are able to produce as firm indicators as we can that work in the real world so that we can measure how primary care is operating in one part of the country when compared with another. I must explain to the hon. Member for York that the diversity of primary care is part of the problem in developing a robust national indicator. Indicators have to be variable because primary care is different, but they will, of course, continue to evolve.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked how we will disseminate any conclusions that we reach. He is aware that there are now far better systems for disseminating information on best practice across the health service. Not all systems are rooted in the mechanism of the NHS executive which, with health authorities, shares best information across the NHS family. One of the great strengths of a national health service is that we can share experience quickly to ensure that best practice is rapidly established. Many centres have specific tasks allocated for dissemination and the bringing together of disparate research. One—the centre for research and dissemination at the University of York—is close to the hon. Gentleman's constituency.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that there are sufficient mechanics across the NHS to ensure that best practice evolving from pilot schemes will be disseminated not just to those in part I—it would be foolish to restrict it to them—but to those who need information to help the delivery of primary care in total. Substantial resources are being devoted to research and development which will take the process further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's unconvincing defence of the indefensible has been extraordinary, conducted
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
with a confetti of notes from his civil servants to get him out of the hole which he has dug. One of the disturbing things about the debate, which has taken us an hour and a half, if the extent to which it simply generates more unease about the Government's real intention behind the Bill. We have not been uncritical, and there are clear areas of concern, but we have been broadly supportive of the possibilities offered by the Bill as a means of improving the quality of primary care. Its outcome will be either very good or deeply damaging. No one could have listended to our debate without concluding that the risks created by the scale of deregulation confronting primary care are potentially extremely damaging.<br><br>
The Minister is clearly much less bold than the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), when he was Secretary of State for Health in 1990. He used florid language to explain why he refused to pilot the 1990 reforms. He thought that he would face a conspiracy of disruption by the British Medical Association. If the Minister denies the importance of evaluation as an integral part of the process, why does not he simply allow primary care to be embarked upon in a completely unregulated free-for-all?<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
It is extraordinary to describe evaluation as a straitjacket. The purpose of undertaking pilots is to understand, in a local, controlled and phased way, the impact of dramatic new ways of providing primary care. The costs to those people who voluntarily engage in the pilots are likely to be wasted effort, squandered talent and a delayed, if not completely halted, process of generalisation from one area of local success to others of national benefit. That leads us to conclude that the pilot process is more about driving through an ideology of deregulation than about experiment and innovation to promote opportunities for improved patient care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Hendry <span class='memberconstituency'>(High Peak)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised to hear what the hon. Lady says. I have considerable contact with GPs in my constituency who are genuinely excited about the Bill's provisions, not because of ideology but because they can see ways in which they can improve patient care. They are delivering services on the frontline and want the opportunity to improve them. Does not the hon. Lady give such doctors the credit of knowing what is good for their patients and communities? Whatever she thinks of the Government's ideology, the people who will make the provisions work have the genuine interests of their patients at heart.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point is made by general practitioners in my own constituency but the proposals have been taken on trust by GPs who have been prepared to believe what the Government say. However, this morning's debate has raised serious questions about the Government's good intentions.<br><br>
We have heard, particularly from my hon. Friend the Member for York, who posed some telling questions, about the Government's willingness to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0519">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
learn from their previous experience of innovation in primary care—we know what happens when people refuse to act on lessons from the past. We want the piloting process to be subject to evaluation, so that every pilot is conducted on the basis that the questions it asks are clear and the answers are recognised as relevant when the experience of that initiative transpires.<br><br>
We also see the process of piloting, linking to evaluation, as rolling out into the process of disseminating the message to a wider audience. That process of development rests entirely on learning from experience that is securely grounded and carefully monitored. The Minister's refusal to accept the amendment is extraordinary. We simply want to ensure that development proceeds on the basis of knowing what works. We opened the debate in a genuine spirit of agreement and consensus. The Minister has denied that possibility so we wish to divide the Committee on the amendment.</span></p>

<p>I call Ms Jowell.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In spite of your thinking that I was my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich, I welcome you, Mr. Anderson, as a fellow Welsh Member of Parliament, to the chairmanship of the Committee.<br><br>
The dozen amendments and three new clauses are even more important in the light of the vote on the previous amendment. They help us to tie the Government down on their intention in the Bill. The Minister's remarks on the previous set of amendments—he said that the Government did not want to set things in stone in the Bill—denies the very purpose of parliamentary scrutiny or, indeed, of legislation as a whole.<br><br>
The Government believe that they have the right to carry on without specifying the exact purpose of the Bill because they are a bunch of good eggs. If the Government are unwilling to accept a system of evaluation such as we have proposed, it is even more important to include consultation procedures in the Bill. That is a fair comment to make about Committee proceedings on all Bills. It is the Murphy's law of Committee proceedings that whatever apparently outlandish set of circumstances one attempts to pose as a hypothesis, what actually happens when a Bill comes into law is the most outlandish hypothesis ever. Bills appear to take on a life of their own when they become Acts because of human ingenuity, the Heisenberg principle of uncertainty and the financial incentive drives people to find loopholes in Bills. If, when I spoke from the Opposition Front Bench on the legislation that became the Electricity Act 1989, I had said that seven years later, most regional electricity companies would be owned by American supply utilities, everyone would have pooh-poohed it and said, "Ridiculous! Even for you, Morgan, that is an outlandish statement". Yet, as time passes, and as human ingenuity is applied to the situation, all proposals become reality in an unpredictable way that goes well beyond a Bill's original intentions. That is why we should include the amendments in the Bill.<br><br>
There should be comprehensive consultation with professional and client groups. The process by which pilot projects are initiated and evaluated or, to use the Government's words, "reviewed", should include a form of obligatory consultation, as prescribed in legislation. That would ensure that the alleged benefits—non-existent benefits, in the case of pilot projects that do not work—are understood and that people other than politicians have a chance to have their say.<br><br>
The amendments break down into two groups, the first of which is the group that relates to local representative committees—LRCs or LMCs and LCCs in Scotland. One of the main obligatory consultees should be local medical committees, which are elected bodies comprising representatives from the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
whole of general practice in any health authority area. The committees have had a statutory framework since 1911 and the introduction of the original Lloyd George national insurance scheme, which was a sort of forerunner to the NHS. The Bill could break up that system. It is somewhat sparse in its consideration of how the representative role of LRCs, LMCs or LCCs will work under a pilot scheme format.<br><br>
Do we want the LRCs to be broken up once pilot schemes exist? LRCs would no longer be so representative of all GPs because pilot scheme GPs would not be obliged to be members of LRCs. That could lead to discrimination within the profession between those doctors who do not take part in pilot schemes and pilot scheme doctors. That would lead to the loss of the integrity of the LMCs in England and Wales and the LCC in Scotland and their ability to express the views of the medical profession on a huge range of issues.<br><br>
The integrity of those committees could be reestablished if pilot scheme doctors were able to vote in LMC elections and were regarded as part of the NHS family in their health authority. The LMC, as a body representative of all doctors, would have the right to consult on proposed pilots and to be consulted on the results of the review before it went national or before it was given a big tick for being a great success or the thumbs down for being a failure.<br><br>
Some of the other amendments refer to patients associations, community health councils and other potential consultee bodies, and would create an obligation to consult before setting up a pilot and at review stage—or, as we prefer to call it, evaluation stage. Before anyone says that the Government do not believe that that is strictly necessary, it is obviously at the knife edge of what they believe is necessary. In Committee, the Government usually say, "Oh well, in the spirit of the legislation we are going to do this anyway, so it's not necessary to put it in the Bill" or, sometimes, they say that the proposal is one that they do not intend to implement so they oppose it on those grounds.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
In this case, the line taken by the Government during debates in the other place falls into the first category. They intend to ensure that there is full consultation with all the relevant professional groups and client organisations—patients' associations, CHCs, advocacy groups and so on—but they do not believe it necessary to include any such measure in the Bill, although, perhaps they might. I think that the final words uttered by the Minister's opposite number in the other place were that the Government were considering whether it was necessary to include an amendment such as the one we propose in the Bill.<br><br>
The Government are within a couple of percentage points of agreeing that an amendment such as this should be included in the Bill. That is how matters were left when they were last discussed in the other place. I believe that my comments represent a reasonable paraphrasing of the remarks made by the Minister's opposite number in the other place. A
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0521">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
month or so has elapsed since that point was reached and further discussions have been held with the relevant professional groups—the BMA, the Royal College, the Consumers Association and so on—all of which are keen to see a stronger obligation to consult widely. We agree with that because we believe that consultation and legislatively obligatory consultation as we propose can help to avoid mistakes.<br><br>
We welcome pilots, but the spirit of piloting is that the medical and other professions will tend to go off in a series of different directions as they attempt to develop a modus operandi for the provision of primary healthcare medicine. There will be an element of diversity of forms of care—that is the essence of piloting. Some pilots will improve episodic treatment of individual illnesses and others will involve the development of continuing responsibility, which is implicit in the list system.<br><br>
We all agree that the medical profession has a retirement and recruitment crisis so we should welcome anything that helps to develop reactions to that crisis in general practice. The crisis relates partly to the 1990 contract and is partly inherent in the changing social reactions to doctors, who have 24-hours-a-day, 365-days-a-year obligations, which can seem fairly terrifying to people in their 20s coming out of medical school.<br><br>
There are many problems and we need to consider how the pilots will solve them. Such problems could be professional or they could be of the gut kind: if there are not enough practising professionals, what should be done? The various solutions will be much stronger and more liable to achieve success if they are the result of full consultation before a pilot is implemented and further full consultation before the pilot is completed.<br><br>
Such are the provisions that the amendments attempt to include in the Bill. They are based on strong advice from the medical and nursing professions as well as from patients' associations and from community health councils. They attempt to ensure that the Secretary of State cannot float off in one direction with a relatively small number of people who have a personal interest in the pilot. The amendments would also mean that, apart from the people in charge of the pilot, those in the health authority who might be persuaded to be enthusiastic about a specific pilot, and the Secretary of State who might be persuaded that a pilot sounds like a good idea, there would be independent voices to represent the totality of the medical profession. The client group or advocacy representatives could have a chance to say, "Oh no, we don't think that would work for the following reasons". Enthusiasm about a particular form of evolution of primary health care sometimes needs to be tempered by the opinions of the rest of the medical profession through the LMC—the primary healthcare collective provider—and those representing patients and consumers more generally.<br><br>
The LMC has the important function of maintaining a balance between the independence of the primary
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
healthcare provider and the state's desire to get the medical profession to provide a basic minimum standard and a universal framework of care for all people regardless of the popularity among doctors of practising in a leafy suburb, a rural area, a city, the Welsh valleys or whatever. The LMC is the mechanism through which the state is able to arbitrate with an independent contractor-based medical profession. It is essential to preserve the integrity of the LMC's representative framework and to incorporate the LMC because that will retain the unity of the primary healthcare profession across a health authority area. The LMC would be one of the principal consultee bodies for the proposal on pilots and their review at the end of the trial period. Given the importance of LMCs, which go back well over 80 years, we believe the Government neglected that consideration when drafting the Bill.<br><br>
We hope that the Government have had time to consider which way they want to go. In the other place it seemed that they were close to supporting some form of obligatory consultation and the continued integrity of the LMC system in the pilots. That would prevent those participating in pilots from becoming a special category of doctors—little princesses. I say little princesses because so many emerging graduates are women. Cardiff medical school is the first to have a student body of more than two thirds women. The average is well over 50 per cent. Cardiff was always in the lead.<br><br>
We do not want medics on pilot schemes to be part of a special category cut off from the rest of the medical profession in their area. That would be divisive. The universality of a successful pilot scheme would be threatened if it were seen to be run by a special category of people. The 80 years of unity in primary health care through the LMCs should be retained and incorporated in the Bill as set out in the 12 amendments and the three new clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heppell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Government have a real opportunity which should not be missed—they are able to restore people's confidence in consultation. Last year, I wrote to all GPs in my area asking what they thought about the future of primary health care and how it should move forward. The responses were interesting. Had I had the opportunity to speak last night, I would have contradicted what the Secretary of State said about GPs views on fundholding and Labour's plans for joint commissioning.<br><br>
A significant aspect of the responses was how grateful doctors were to be consulted. One said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Thank you very much for your letter consulting general practitioners on how we should take primary care forward. We value this opportunity to comment."</p></blockquote>
Another said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Thank you very much for your letter of 7 March 1996. It is refreshing to see a political party taking an interest in general practitioners' views."</p></blockquote>
Yet another said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Thank you for your letter asking for my views on the future of primary care. May I say how nice it is to be asked. I would hope that in the event of a labour government the views of those who work in the Health Service will be listened to. I think in large
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0522">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
measure the low morale of health professionals is that we feel we can see very clearly where the problems are but our views have not been taken into account by this present government. Enormous changes have occurred without consultation, without proper research or pilot studies and despite the government's protestations I do doubt their goodwill towards the health service."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has an opportunity to try to restore people's faith in the Government's goodwill towards the health service. He has an opportunity to persuade doctors that their views are listened to.<br><br>
On Third Reading of the Bill in another place, Baroness Cumberlege stated when replying to an amendment on consultation that
<br><blockquote><p>"consultation will be a key feature of piloting. However, we are not indifferent to the strength of feeling expressed by many of your Lordships and in the light of this we will consider whether some of the undertakings we have given might be given greater force on the face of the Bill. We will, if appropriate, come back with amendments".—[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 30 January 1997; Vol. 577, c. 1267.]</p></blockquote>
I am not aware of any such amendments being tabled, but it would be appropriate to do so.<br><br>
The role of local medical committees is set out in the National Health Service Act 1977, which requires health authorities to consult local medical committees on such occasions and to such an extent as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State. I would have thought that this would be one of those instances when the Secretary of State should be prescribing that and the easiest method of doing so would be to ensure that it is in the Bill.<br><br>
Other amendments refer to patient consultation. The Government's record on patient consultation has been poor, to say the least. Anyone who has attended consultation exercises with a trust and so on will recognise how poor such consultation is. I have been to a number of the annual meetings at which there was supposed to be consultation with the public and patients about what is happening in trusts. I attended one at which there must have been 70 or 80 people and I asked how many were patients. It turned out that they were all from the health authority or other trusts in the area, or were health professionals. The only people who were not health professionals employed by trusts or health authorities at that so-called public meeting were myself and one other person. It can hardly be said that that consultation was valuable. There were plenty of glossy brochures and beautiful slides, but the slides were being seen by people who work within the health authority rather than people who use the services of the health authority.<br><br>
I agree with the Consumers Association which described the current requirements for consultation in the national health service as "cursory and tokenistic exercises". When I pointed out that the figures on remuneration for non-executive directors were wrong, I was told that I was right and that was the end of the discussion.<br><br>
At another meeting I attended there was another lovely slide show, plenty of glossy brochures and an assurance that everything was going well with no problems. Within a week of that meeting we learned about a £3 million deficit—it may have been £5 million. That trust had not thought to mention that at
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
the public consultation meeting a few evenings previously. It had not been considered important enough to mention. That is the problem with most of the consultation exercises. We are shown what the trusts and health authorities want us to see. We are never shown anthing that is controversial or which might give rise to dispute. Another example is the City hospital in my constituency. The health authority wanted to sell some land so that a supermarket could be built on it. The City hospital was up in arms and said that it was land that we could use for the requirements of the health service.<br><br>
When the health authority offered the trust half the money from the sale of the land the hospital trust's view suddenly changed. The trust sent out leaflets to people in the surrounding area in support of the bid by Sainsbury's to buy the land and claimed that extra money would be brought into the trust. I wrote to the Secretaries of State for Health and for the Environment at the time because to me, those leaflets clearly breached planning laws. Councillors on planning committees should not be blackmailed by the idea that health care in their area would suffer if, by turning down applications from supermarkets such as Sainsbury's, they would deprive the health authority of money. I did not consider the responses that I received from those Secretaries of State to be satisfactory.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
In the end, when the rules changed and it was decided that the money was to go to the management executive, the City hospital trust decided that it needed the land—after all, it was not getting the money—and it now has plans for developments relevant to health care on that land.<br><br>
None of those issues was even discussed with the local community health council. I only found about a £4 million deal under the private finance initiative a year after it had started. When I wrote to the health authority and asked why the public did not know about the scheme, initially the health authority denied that it was happening and then it said that plans were at an early stage—although the scheme had gone out to tender a year before I had raised the matter.<br><br>
In the end, when it became clear that something had been going on for a year, the health authority said that it had decided that there was no public interest in the issue and that was why it had not been discussed with the community health council. I said that it was disgraceful that £4 million of taxpayers' money had been used in a deal about which no one had been consulted. Its response was that the chief executive of the CHC was entitled to the minutes of the land subcommittee of the health authority, so he should have referred them back to the CHC. None of that constitutes meaningful consultation. It is nonsense to talk about consultation when anything that is likely to be contentious is sidetracked.<br><br>
The Minister has an opportunity to reassure the public about the Government's health care plans by allowing doctors and other members of the medical profession to be involved in real consultation and,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0523">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
more important, by allowing patients and other members of the public to know what is going on. The pilot schemes have much more chance of success if people know exactly what is happening. We do not want schemes to be dropped into people's laps without their having had a chance to agree or disagree with them. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will reconsider the issue—as Baroness Cumberlege has done—and agree to the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to respond in the debate. I say to Opposition Members that we took the matter seriously. Following the debates in another place, I have closely considered whether there is a persuasive argument in favour of amending the Bill. I am afraid that I must tell Opposition members of the Committee that I am about to disappoint them, but I hope that I shall be able to reassure them that the Bill contains sufficient measures—in combination with what has already been set out in the public domain and the on-going process of shaping consultation—to satisfy their concerns.<br><br>
I turn first to the principal measure of the Bill. Clause 2(5) makes it clear that,
<br><blockquote><p>"Before submitting proposals for a pilot scheme, an authority must (in addition to complying with any requirements about consultation imposed by or under any other enactment) comply with any directions given to them by the Secretary of State about the extent to which, and manner in which, they are to consult on the proposals."</p></blockquote>
The process of consultation is double-layered. A range of existing procedures is already in place and can be built on—that is the first step. The hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) mentioned community health councils. There are statutory requirements to consult community health councils on a proposal that involves a substantive change in how health services are provided.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have before me a Scottish Office document about implementing "Choice and Opportunity". I am told that the English equivalent makes specific reference to community health councils. Perhaps the Minister could confirm whether that is the case. Will he pass on my concerns to the Scottish Health Minister that there does not appear to be a specific reference to community health councils in the Scottish document? Their input, not to mention their role in conducting consultations and disseminating information, is crucial.<br><br>
The Scottish Office document refers to two stages—I do not know whether that is the case for England, too. An initial expression of interest in April and May will be followed by a detailed application at the end of September. Will the Minister pass on my concerns that there should be consultation at the initial as well as the second stage?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I take the hon. Gentleman's point and will examine the detail of his comments. If he reads subsection (5), he will realise that it sets out
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
clearly measures relating to any existing statutory consultative processes. The hon. Gentleman was concerned that the issue was not referred to, or was referred to differently in the Scottish and English documents. The important point in terms of setting out the first layer of consultation is to repeat our present statutory obligations, but if the hon. Gentleman has a special concern, I have noted it. I will examine carefully what he said and, if necessary, write to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The nature of consultation with a CHC about a substantial change in health service provision is already subject to major controversy for two reasons. The first is the very obvious point that no one can decide exactly what is substantial. There is a danger that because primary health care changes are less easy to define, they would not be considered so substantial as changes in secondary health care such as closure of a ward or a hospital.<br><br>
Secondly, temporary changes—which, by their nature, pilot schemes will be—have never been considered as substantial changes. To my knowledge, only permanent changes have ever been considered to come under the statutory obligation to consult community health councils. Will the Minister give some consideration to that problem?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point is answered by the primary legislation, which clearly states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Before submitting proposals for a pilot scheme, an authority must (in addition to complying with any requirements about consultation imposed by or under any other enactment) comply with any directions given to them by the Secretary of State about the extent to which, and manner in which, they are to consult on the proposals."</p></blockquote>
That specifically refers to an obligation to consult on proposals for a pilot scheme, so it answers the hon. Gentleman's point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister advising the Committee, based on the advice that he has received, that all pilot schemes will be referred to a community health council?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, that is the implication of what he has just said. He needs to think about the matter very carefully. I think that he is telling the Committee that we need no additional provision to ensure that CHCs are consulted because one already exists. If he is not saying that it is already obligatory under other enactments, why does he object to our attempt to include the provision?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me explain. I said that the clause must be considered together with my comments about existing CHC rules. If there is deemed to be a major change in provision of service, the existing right to be consulted will remain in place. I cannot give a precise definition of a major service change. The relevant matters are already resolved—CHCs have the right to be consulted on all substantial developments and variations in the NHS. If a substantial variation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0524">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
resulted from the submission of a pilot proposal—I am not discussing the permanent arrangement that the hon. Gentleman raised—CHCs would have a statutory right to be consulted. I expect the health authority and those submitting the proposal to resolve that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether or not the Minister is contradicting me. If I am right, the general procedure is that all temporary changes are not considered to be substantial changes with regard to the obligation to consult CHCs. If so, should not that matter be covered in the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I follow the hon. Gentleman and I take his point. If a pilot proposal is made before a permanent arrangement and if it involves a substantial variation in services, a CHC would have the statutory right to be consulted. Subsection (5) could not be clearer; it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Before submitting proposals for a pilot scheme".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I give way to the hon. Gentleman, I must say that I find it hard to see how I could be clearer or more specific about this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me explain the problem. The Minister seems to be dodging between making permanent an apparently successful pilot and approving of a pilot in the first place. I am discussing the latter, and I think that he is discussing it as well. Will a CHC have to be consulted before a pilot scheme is approved in the first place? If so, that would run contrary to the current practice in the NHS, which is to say that anything that is only a temporary change will not be considered to be a substantial change with regard to the obligation to consult CHCs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to get my mind round the last phrase that the hon. Gentleman used. I shall paraphrase him in words that I find slightly easier to take on board. I believe that he was asking about the original stage of a pilot, which is when it is submitted as a proposal, before it goes to the Secretary of State and the necessary box is ticked and it flies on its way. If there is a significant change or variation in local health service provision at that stage, does a CHC have to be consulted? I think that that is the tenor of his question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated assent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He indicates that that is broadly so. If that is the case, it does have to be consulted. Subsection (5) says that the process of complying with requirements should occur before the submission of proposals. A commonsense understanding of what that means suggests that a CHC would be entitled to be consulted under current regulations.<br><br>
That is, however, but the first plank in the consultation process. Current statutory requirements will also be kept in place and we shall seek out local views and proposals, including those of patients and members of CHCs. The latter are an obvious source of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
advice with regard to any proposal—they are not only consulted on a statutory basis when a major variation is involved. The proposal involves the second plank, which involves what the Secretary of State can do to direct health authorities to ensure that they consult. That is in the spirit of current practice.<br><br>
New clause 6 will extend the right of local medical committees to levy GPs who provide personal medical services. New clauses 17 and 18 would provide for local representative committees, which are also comprised of doctors and dentists, to provide personal medical and dental services, repsectively, to be recognised.<br><br>
We fully accept the need for local representative committees to be able to comment on the impact of pilots on current part II services—of course we do—but that is not the same as taking every aspect of the present world into the new, which is what the amendments would achieve. We are looking for something more flexible in line with the very flexibilities that the pilots are intended to produce.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
I shall deal briefly with the new powers that the Bill gives the Secretary of State. These are powers to make directions setting out who is to be consulted—beyond the layer that the hon. Member for Cardiff, West pressed me upon. Evidence already exists that the Secretary of State is firmly committed to exercising those powers.<br><br>
I have already referred to the national consultative group. The role of the group is developing well and is a fundamental element of the consultative process. Members of the group are supportive of the Bill's principles. Their role is to act as a forum for providing the NHS Executive with initial guidance on issues regarding choice and opportunity as a whole. No decisions will be taker by the group, but it still needs to receive comments from a wider audience. The group will decide how wide that audience should be. That will continue the process of wider organisational participation, which has been carried forward throughout the process leading up to the introduction of the Bill.<br><br>
I beg to suggest to the Committee that a fundamental obligation to consult is already incorporated in the Bill. It would be wrong to extend the detail of that consultation process to a range of pilots, which may be small but wide. I hope that the Committee will accept the Government's assurance that the consultation process, which led to this legislation, will be ensured, not only by my assurances to the Committee, but because that is set out in the processes that are in hand involving the national consultative group. There is more than adequate reason for the Committee to accept that broad consultation will be carried out throughout the process. I hope that the Committee will reject the amendments or that the hon. Member for Cardiff, West will withdraw them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that there will be considerable interest tomorrow in reading the textual exegesis of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0525">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
what the Minister said in <i>Hansard.</i> My understanding of what he said, in the light of his assurance, is that no pilot can be proposed to the Secretary of State without consultation with the community health council</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not what I said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reads what I said—and I shall say it again—it is explicit. If a pilot incorporates a substantial variation in local service, the community health council will be consulted because the original statutory requirement will apply. The hon. Gentleman wants to add an amendment to the effect that every pilot, whether or not it incorporates such a substantial variation, should be submitted to a CHC. Only those that conform to the substantial variation rule will automatically be referred. I cannot think how to make that any clearer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the Minister is now contradicting what he said earlier. We shall need to see the textual exegesis of his remarks when <i>Hansard</i> is printed. It is an important issue and one that will be seen to be important by people outside the House. However, in the light of my interpretation of what the Minister said earlier, and in the belief that we shall have another opportunity to return to the matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 2, line 46, after "included,", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"including information on the transfer of employment and pensions rights of employees,".</p></blockquote>
This requires health authorities or health boards to include information about the transfer of employment and pension rights of any employees in any proposal for a pilot scheme. For many years, the Royal College of Nursing has been lobbying for practice nurses to be entitled to the NHS superannuation scheme in a similar fashion to nurses employed by trusts. Clearly, any employee in a pilot—a nurse or another employee—should be entitled to that. However, there is a prior problem. The Government have not yet dealt satisfactorily with the position of practice staff under existing contracts, notwithstanding the pledge in "Primary Care: Delivering the Future", and a similar pledge in Scotland, that the NHS pension scheme would be open to GP practice staff from 1 September of this year. The problem emerged during debates on Report in another place. Baroness Cumberlege said:
<br><blockquote><p>"GPs will become the employing authorities for the purpose of the NHS pension scheme regulations, and they will be able to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
choose whether they wish their practice staff to become members of the scheme."—[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 23 January 1997; Vol. 577, c. 817.]</p></blockquote>
Allowing GPs to choose whether nurses and other employees receive pension rights goes against the spirit of "Primary Care: Delivering the Future", which states that the exclusion of staff from the NHS pension scheme is "clearly anomalous". For GPs to choose whether they should be part of the scheme is both wrong in principle and would create a new anomaly, whereby nurses and other employees would find that their choice of workplace continued to influence their ability to receive an NHS pension.<br><br>
The problem may well be not the perversity of GPs, but the fact that it could cost them more. The British Medical Association has expressed views on that and I seek the Minister's comments on them. The BMA points out that the key to GP participation is direct reimbursement of the employer contribution, which is 4 per cent. of salary.<br><br>
When staff join the NHS pension scheme, employer national insurance contributions will drop by 3 per cent. of salary because staff will no longer be members of SERPS, which will be a saving to health boards or health authorities. However, health boards or health authorities will not be obliged to direct that back into pension provision, by means of direct reimbursement of employer contributions to the NHS pension scheme. Potentially, therefore, we have the unacceptable situation of a saving on pension provision being spent elsewhere. Will the Minister tell us whether employees of GP practices have pension rights under both existing arrangements and pilots, which is the subject of the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to set out the Government's position on that matter and to reinforce the fact that we have made substantial progress in response to suggestions made to us by a range of professions, in particular the medical and nursing professions, about the provision of practice pensions. Perhaps it might be helpful to set out a little of the background.<br><br>
While a pension scheme is part of an employer's overall remuneration package, there is no precedent for the Government to dictate to GPs what pay and other benefits they should offer their staff. That is the first problem with the hon. Gentleman's suggestion. There has always been a difference between general practitioners as individual employers and those who constitute health service bodies. If it is argued that GPs may not offer such benefits, I point out to the hon. Gentleman that representatives from GPs were among those who argued most vigorously for the change. The argument was forcibly made that unless GPs offered such benefits they would not be able to attract good staff. Instead of trying completely to change the basis on which GPs make decisions about whom they employ in their practices and on what terms they wish to employ them, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) should listen to the arguments put forward by GPs themselves—that they needed the opportunity to offer those advantages.<br><br>
One can understand that, in some circumstances, a potential employee may not want that advantage and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0526">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 117</span>
may want remuneration in another way. In extending the opportunity to GPs and those employed in practices, we would be wrong to examine the issue rigidly and to curtail the advantages that both may see in the extention of the scheme, to which the Government have agreed.<br><br>
It is in GPs' interest to become employing authorities under the NHS pension scheme. Joining that scheme is advantageous to them: it is a good, value-for-money option. I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that it is unlikely—unless mutually agreed in the interests of both employer and employee—that the benefit would be lost to those employed in GP practices.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leith asked me a specific question about reimbursement of costs of NHS pensions to employers for their staff. Through the mechanisms of reimbursement already in place, there will be 100 per cent. reimbursement. The question is whether the costs of any specific GP would be reimbursed directly 100 per cent. That is a different matter. The hon. Gentleman suggests that there should be different arrangements for reimbursing GPs for that element of their staff costs. There are already well-established procedures and usually reimbursement is at 70 per cent. of the cost, although authorities have discretion to pay up to 100 per cent. My answer to the hon. Gentleman, therefore, is that the system already has sufficient flexibility, and if a demand or problem is conceded in an area by health authorities and GPs, the rule could be varied. That system has stood the test of time. It will be possible to vary it at local level should a need be demonstrated.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
On the basis of that reassurance, I ask the hon. Gentleman to reconsider his position and withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot reconsider my position, but I may withdraw the amendment. However, there is still a problem and hon. Members will appreciate that nurses feel that they will be at the mercy at a GP's discretion. That is an unsatisfactory arrangement within the new equality that we want in the primary care community. However, I am not here to criticise GPs who, I am sure, will want to implement those pension rights. However, they have specific financial concerns and further negotiation will be necessary.<br><br>
The Minister described a harmonious world in which there were no conflicts of interest. However, the BMA claims that there is a problem and that further negotiations will be necessary. In the hope that the Minister will continue to talk to the RCN, the BMA and other bodies, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
