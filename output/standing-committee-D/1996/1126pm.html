SELECTIVE ADMISSIONS TO COUNTY OR VOLUNTARY SCHOOLS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>Amendment moved [this day]: No. 50, in page 52, line 46, leave out 'either'.—[<i>Mr. Win Griffiths.</i>]</p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this amendment we are taking in No. 51, page 52, line 47, leave out from 'so' to end of line 1 on page 53.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will remember that this morning I described circumstances in which a selective school could find it difficult to maintain the amount of selection it has previously attained. Under the requirements of the Bill, a school would have to receive permission from the Secretary of State before it could officially reduce the amount of selection. We believe that in such circumstances the Secretary of State would be constrained to grant the necessary permission. It could be said that the circumstances I described would be unlikely to arise in practice, but in fact the way in which the Bill is constructed makes them all the more likely. If for example, in a city area with just one selective school, one or two nearby comprehensive decide that they will also go selective, the school that had previously not had any competition in selection could find that it cannot meet its selection target because there is an insufficient mumber of pupils to choose from.<br><br>
Part of the reason for restricting the extent to which selection can be increased is to avoid the possibility that pupils will be left with nowhere to go. Clause 11 suggests that the Secretary of State is concerned that that might happen. The amendment will allow a natural process by which schools can adjust to the circumstances that face them. While it is right for the Secretary of State to be worried about schools exceeding the numbers they can select without first consulting the Secretary of State, consultation seems unnecessary when a school finds it has to go below those numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I detected that even the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), with all his ingenuity, was struggling with the amendment because it is a rather bizarre one to emerge from the Opposition. I say that for two reasons, one of principle
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>
and the other of practice. In principle, I and the Bill are on sound ground in saying that the mechanism to consider either an increase or a decrease in selection should be equally weighted; I believe intellectually that that is right. However, in practical terms—and that is probably the more important argument in this case—I do not understand how the hon. Gentleman can argue that a school seeking to reduce its selection could do so with no impact on surrounding schools. It is legitimate properly to consider and scrutinise a significant increase in selection, and a decrease in selection merits the same degree of scrutiny because it has the same potential to affect other local schools' admission arrangements and provision of places. I do not accept what I understood to be the hon. Gentleman's contention—that although an increase could have an impact, a decrease would not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If a school that has been selecting 35 per cent. of its pupils suddenly finds that, under the Bill, one or two other schools have begun selecting and that there are no longer sufficient pupils for it to select 35 per cent. of its intake, why should it be required to consult the Secretary of State? For all practical purposes it could not select 35 per cent. of its pupils because there is not a sufficient number of pupils. Even though plenty of others might want to fill places in the school, the school would not be able to accept them because it would need the Secretary of State's permission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am right in saying that the school will have to accept the pupils. It cannot maintain empty places when there are pupils requiring them. I shall check in a moment, but I think that I am right in saying that the picture drawn by the hon. Gentleman could not come about. There is an important provision later in the Bill to prevent that happening—for among other things, the reason given by the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what I was trying to confirm. It seemed to me that the school would not be able to do that. The Minister seems to be saying that if a school that had been selecting 35 per cent. of its pupils found that it could select only 25 per cent., it could fill the remaining 75 per cent. of places without recourse to consultation with the Secretary of State. In what circumstances is there the need for consultation provided in schedule 1?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A distinction should be drawn between the amount of explicit selection that a school wishes to have in its admissions policy—that is what the Bill is about—and what will occur in practice term by term. The important provision that I referred to is clause 27, which we shall not reach for some time. It provides that a school cannot refuse entry to pupils if there are empty places resulting from its inability to fill the selective element of its entry. For that reason, the scenario outlined by the hon. Gentleman could not come about, which is why I am rather confident in suggesting that the Committee should reject the amendment.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 127</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased with what the Minister said. It seemed as if a school might have a problem in filling places if not enought pupils wanted the selected places. I imagine that the Minister was more concerned about schools that decide to change selection policy rather than the practical circumstances. Given the way in which the Minister has outlined his case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 27, in page 53, line 13, leave out 'to any extent'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 28, in page 53, line 14, leave out 'to any extent'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. These are probing amendments. I am unclear as to what is proposed in schedule 1. Specialist schools are another category of school that the Government wish to encourage. The Opposition recognise that some children have a particular aptitude in music or art and that is sensible that those aptitudes should be encouraged to the fullest extent.<br><br>
We are still talking of consultation procedures in relation to changes in admissions policy for all categories of school. It is therefore puzzling that paragraph 2(7)(a) should refer to the proportion of selective admissions exceeding 20 per cent. "to any extent" only in relation to specialist schools, and that paragraph 2(7)(b) should refer, also in relation to specialist schools, to circumstances in which the proportion of selective admissions
<br><blockquote><p>"Would, as the result of a proposed variation, exceed that percentage to any extent."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister explain why those words are in the schedule, what they mean and why they refer specifically to specialist schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of paragraph 2(7) is to confirm two matters: first, that specialist schools have the same freedom as other local education authority schools to select up to 20 per cent. of their pupils by general ability or by ability in or aptitude for particular subjects without central approval; and secondly, we want to ensure that specialist schools have an additional freedom to select a further 10 per cent. of pupils by ability in or aptitude for their specialist subjects, thus making their threshold 30 per cent. in total.<br><br>
For example, if a specialist school was already selecting 20 per cent. of its intake by general ability and 5 per cent. by ability or aptitude for its specialist subject, its threshold for further increases would be 30 per cent., only if the extra 5 per cent. were selected by ability or aptitude for its specialist subject. I am advised that the words "to any extent" after the references to 20 per cent. are necessary for drafting purposes. Further on in paragraph 2(7) at line 18, reference is made to
<br><blockquote><p>"the extent of that excess".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
It makes it clearer to have specific references to "extent" in lines 13 and 15, which are then picked up in line 18 of the paragraph.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 27 and 28 would probably not change the effect of paragraph 2(7), but I am advised that they would make it harder to follow—if anyone can believe that. I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to be difficult, but I genuinely do not understand the Minister's explanation. Will he clarify the drafting necessity and say why such words are necessary in relation to specialist schools, but not to grant-maintained or local education authority schools that go in for selection? What do the words
<br><blockquote><p>"exceed 20 per cent. to any extent"</p></blockquote>
mean—90 per cent., 25 per cent., or what? It is unclear whether the so-called drafting necessity will allow for greater flexibility than would be permitted in other schools. We tabled the amendments to seek that clarification. Can the Minister help?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that we wading knee deep—if not thigh deep—in the way in which the Bill is worded. I confess to the hon. Lady and the Committee that I am relying in such matters on advice from parliamentary consel through the legal experts in the Department.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I finish my attempt at an explanation? I am advised that, because specialist schools operate what I shall loosely describe as a "hybrid" admissions procedure—if I can use that parliamentary term in a different context—a combination of admissions might arise in relation either to general aptitude or by subject. As a result, the words are necessary in the view of counsel who drafted the Bill to clarify the difference between specialist schools admissions and the more general admissions policies of, say, a county school.<br><br>
I am willing to rely on the advice of parliamentary counsel that, to achieve our objectives for specialist schools, the inclusion of the words is necessary to make clear the intention and operation of the provision. I can understand the hon. Lady's confusion because, in a sense, I share it, but if we were to accept the amendment and remove the words, there would be a risk of confusion that would help no one—neither schools nor admission authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are being told that the words are essential to the Bill but, to allay my fears, will the Minister assure me that specialist schools will be treated in the same way as any other sort of school in relation to admissions according to ability? I accept that specialist schools may increase the proportion by up to 10 per cent. for the specialist subject and that levels may vary within that limit, but will such schools be treated exactly as any other school choosing selection by ability in its admissions policy?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 129</span>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must crave the hon. Lady's indulgence on that point. I am reluctant to give her an immediate response because, looking sideways over my shoulder and reading the body language that I see, I sense that were I to attempt to give an answer to her reasonable question, I could mislead the Committee. May I suggest that, after pondering the question and taking advice, I write to the hon. Lady with a proper reply? She could then judge whether she wants to return to the matter. I hope, Mr. O'Hara, that that is in order; I am always reluctant to give an off-the-cuff and potentially misleading answer to a perfectly reasonable question on a rather detailed and technical point. I hope that the hon. Lady will accept that offer in the spirit in which I make it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to do so and await the letter, so I beg to, ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 43, in page 53, leave out lines 23 to 30.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments: </span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 61, in page 53, leave out lines 31 to 40.</p>
<p>No. 15, in clause 4, page 5, line 20, leave out from beginning to end of line 4 on page 6.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I speak specifically to amendment No. 43, which would delete those lines dealing with the post-16 age group—or sixth forms, to use a shorthand. In previous debates, we have expressed our concerns about the Government's intention to allow schools to increase selection levels without going through the publication procedures established under the Education Act 1996. The Government have made it clear that they intend to move down that route, however, and have accordingly proposed changes to the selection arrangements that would not require schools to go through the publication procedure. In cases involving more fundamental changes, whereby the proportion of selective admissions would cross the threshold level, the publication procedures will still apply under paragraph 2(4).<br><br>
Despite the proposals under paragaph 2(4), however, paragraph 3 effectively means that, in relation to sixth forms, schools can move from having no selection to complete selection without having to go through the publication procedure. Will the Minister explain that? It does not seem logical that the Government should require the procedures to apply for all other age groups when fundamental changes are made—when the threshold is crossed—whereas such changes can be made in relation to sixth forms without a school having to go through the publication procedure.<br><br>
As we have argued, such changes in selection levels can have an effect on pupils at other schools and colleges. Under paragraph 3(1), a school could choose to adopt full selection without using the publication procedure even though that change could have a major impact on a local sixth-form or tertiary college
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 130</span>
currently providing places to young people post-16 to study for their A-levels. Likewise, paragraph 3(3) seems to exempt sixth forms from the provisions under paragraph 3(2).<br><br>
As well as the principle involved, there is an issue of making legislation understandable, Some of the answers that the Minister gave this morning demonstrated the fact that the Bill is extremely complicated and confusing. The way in which paragraph 3(1) relates to both paragraph 3(3) and 2(4) is extremenly complicated and not readily understandable to most school governors, heads or parents.<br><br>
Legislation that is as complicated as that is not good when we are talking about the organisation of our children's education. I should like the Minister to explain why sixth-form schools seem to be free to do what they want without going through the publication procedures that apply to certain changes and selection arrangements under paragraphs 1 and 2.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 3 of schedule 1 deals with cases where the publication of statutory proposals is not required for changes in selective admissions to LEA schools, as the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) said. New section 265B—inserted into the Education Act 1996 under clause 4—does the same for grant-maintained schools. Those provisions follow on from paragraph 2 of schedule 1 and new section 265A respectively.<br><br>
Paragraph 2(4) and new section 265A(4) provide that, if there is any change to the proportion of selective admissions that makes a school cross the relevant threshold, statutory proposals must always be published.<br><br>
Paragraph 3 and new section 265B introduce two exceptions—as the hon. Member for Attercliffe has said—neither of which would result in significant changes to the character of a school. Under present law, they would not require central approval. So they are practical measures that make life easier for admission authorities and schools.<br><br>
The first exemption means that schools need not seek central approval for changes in the proportion of selective admissions to sixth forms. For many, that should not be an issue because sixth forms are made up entirely of pupils who come up through the school. It would be an issue only for schools that admit pupils at age 16, and the number of admissions at that age is ususally very small.<br><br>
Entry to sixth forms—whether from within or without the school—is traditionally selective, one way or another. The Department has always taken the view that changes in the proportion of pupils selected to a sixth form does not significantly change the character of a school.<br><br>
The second exemption means that schools will not need to publish statutory proposals when the proportion of pupils selected does not change although a new relevant age group for admissions is introduced—for example, if an 11 to 16 school started to admit at age 12. That would not in itself require
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0172">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 131</span>
statutory proposals because it would not significantly change the school's character by extending its age range.<br><br>
A school might already select more than 50 per cent. of the pupils admitted at age 11. Without the insertion of new section 265B(2), that school would have to publish statutory proposals even if the proportion of 12-year-olds admitted by selection was no higher than the proportion of admissions at age 11.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 43 and 61 would remove the exceptions for sixth-form admissions and new relevant age groups for LEA schools. Amendment No. 15 would do the same for grant-maintained schools. Those amendments would require schools to publish proposals in circumstances where, as I have said, a school's character had not changed at all based on established precedent and practice. That is not necessary and it does not make sense in the context of the Bill. I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what the Minister said, but I want to press the issue of whether there would be a significant change to the character of a school. I agree with what the Minister said in that, for the most part, pupils move to the sixth form through natural progression within a school. Many schools do not currently select their sixth forms and provide a range of post-16 courses for young people with an academic bent and a less academic bent to pursue. It is possible to envisage such a school deciding that it was going to select at that stage and to provide courses only for those of an academic inclination.<br><br>
That would be possible in my city, Sheffield, because we have a mixture of schools catering for an age range of 11 to 16 and a small number with an 11 to 18 age range. So some young people in my constituency change school at the age of 16. Many of them go to the local college to pursue sixth-form and other vocational types of education, but some of them go to the sixth forms of other schools in the city. If those schools were in future to decide that they were going to concentrate on certain academic courses and to select the pupils that they took from other schools, that would fundamentally change the educational arrangements for young people in my constituency; it would also significantly change the character of those schools.<br><br>
Will the Minister explain how it would not be a significant change in the character of a school that at present does not select at all suddenly to decide that it will select completely, and why it would not have to go through the publication procedures laid down for other cases?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am resting on established practice. In our departmental experience of post-16 education, the problem that the hon. Gentleman is suggesting will arise has not arisen—and it will not arise. We should bear in mind that the post-16 environment is radically different from the compulsory five to 16 environment where basic need, the number of places and so on are critical considerations. It is fair to say that in the more
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 132</span>
flexible and competitive environment of post-16 provision, the arrangement proposed, which will allow local discretion for schools to make their own judgments, fits much more logically and comfortably than the approach which I understand to be the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's amendments, under which decisions would on every occasion be referred to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
So I do not believe that the sort of problem that the hon. Gentleman describes need or would arise. However, I can tell him—and I can say this for the rest of the Bill—that if difficulties such as he suggests arise subsequent to the passage of the Bill, we shall, of course, be prepared to reconsider the matter.<br><br>
I must remind the Committee of the tendency—the understandable tendency, perhaps—of Opposition Members to predict with great confidence every time we make a change such as this that there will be chaos and that it will not work. That rather underestimates the capacity and the desire of schools in the communities of Opposition Members to do things that they see will benefit their pupils—whether those aged five to 16 or, in this case, those aged over 16.<br><br>
I think that the hon. Gentleman is basing his argument for the amendment on the assumption that somehow schools will always want to do what is impractical and what will damage the prospects of young people. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and I can agree that that is a misreading of the motivation of everybody in education—which is a desire to do what is best for young people.<br><br>
So I rest my case on a combination of the confidence that I have in the desires of people involved in education and the precedent of the established procedures of the Department for the age group that we are discussing. For that reason, the amendments are unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to what the Minister had to say. With reference to his final point, we are throughout the Committee's deliberations—rightly, as an Opposition—raising concerns that the Bill may allow a school, if it so chooses, to act in a way that may affect not necessarily its pupils but others. Other schools could be damaged if their circumstances are not fully considered. I accept what the Minister said that generally we can trust schools to behave responsibly and that they will not always take the legislation that is handed to them to its most illogical extent.<br><br>
Given that the procedures are not a fundamental change from the existing arrangements and our desire to make progress on other aspects of the Bill, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 44, in page 54, line 10, at end insert

I failed to join in the usual catalogue of praise for your wisdom this morning, Mr. O'Hara. Of course, I do that, but I have to say, too, that it must be an extremely frustrating experience for you to be Chairman of the Committee. You are well known to all hon. Members as someone with expertise and experience in education matters. You have become involved in and shown considerable concern for the schools in the city that you represent, so it must be very frustrating to have to be silent while we are discussing these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Silent? Is that possible?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I mean silent, apart from keeping people like me in order.<br><br>
Amendment No. 44 refers to the consultation process before specialist schools expand their selection. It would apply when the governing body of a local education authority county specialist school requests that the LEA varies the arrangements to allow for an increase in selective admissions. If
<br><blockquote><p>"the governing body reasonably form the opinion that the authority have not made satisfactory progress"</p></blockquote>
after two months, the Secretary of State may require the LEA to implement the proposals.<br><br>
We have three main objections to that proposal. First, it duplicates existing legislation. Section 496 of the Education Act 1996—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. A little levity is allowed in the Committee but it should not disrupt it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is dubious whether the proposal in schedule 1 is necessary because it duplicates existing legislation. Section 496 of the Education Act 1996 allows the Secretary of State to prevent the unreasonable exercise of functions by a local education authority. Therefore, the Secretary of State can intervene if a local authority fails to implement those provisions, but are we to assume that the Secretary of State is doubtful that she can justify using the power within two months of an LEA being approached by a governing body? By definition, if there is no duplication, the actions of the LEA must be reasonable and should not be overridden.<br><br>
Secondly, there is no requirement for consultation, so the Secretary of State has effectively no knowledge of the LEA's views before determining the issue. That is one-sided decision-making that detracts from the Secretary of State's quasi-judicial stance.<br><br>
Thirdly, the process can be activated two months after the application has gone to the LEA when the governing body considers that the LEA has not made satisfactory progress towards complying. The normal expectation would be that the request of the governing body would be reported to the next meeting of the LEA education committee, so the implications for other schools in the area can be properly considered. There should be consultation with the governing bodies of local schools likely to be affected by the proposal. Consultation should not be unduly delayed, and subsequently a report on the consultation should be made to the education committee. It is, therefore, unrealistic to think that all that can be achieved in two
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 134</span>
months. Ministers often lambast local authorities for their slowness in operating, but here they expect local authorities to act with express speed. They assume that local authorities will consult their officers and take into account the proposal's effect on other schools in an area, and that that information should be reported to the education committee before a decision is reached. All that cannot be done in two months. The proposal is, in my view, unnecessary, but if the Government intend to proceed with it, a time limit of at least four months would be much more logical.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To develop their specialist subjects, specialist schools may wish to introduce an element of selection by ability or aptitude in those subjects. The Bill will enable them to select up to 30 per cent. without central approval. It is right that county and controlled specialist schools should be allowed to benefit from this flexibility. But local education authorities, as admission authorities, can block the governors in those circumstances.<br><br>
Where an LEA has not reponded constructively to a request from governors of a special school to change their admission arrangements to introduce or extend selection within the 30 per cent. threshold, the governing body will, under the Bill's provisions, be able to refer the matter to the Secretary of State. If my right hon. Friend, or the holder of her office, decides to approve the governors' proposal, she will be able to direct the LEA to implement it.<br><br>
Amendment No. 44 would require the Secretary of State to consult the LEA and to have regard to its advice before making her decision. I argue that the amendment is unnecessary. The Bill gives governing bodies a right of appeal where they have reasonably decided that the LEA has not made satisfactory progress towards complying with their request. In considering the appeal, the Secretary of State will, of course, consider the circumstances of the governors' requests and any comments from the LEA. Requiring the Secretary of State formally to consult the LEA would delay her consideration of appeals in the very circumstances that the appeal provision was designed to overcome—where LEAs have blocked or delayed reasonable plans for developing a school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister offer schools guidelines about the definition of the phrase in the Bill "reasonably form the opinion"? As he knows, each governing body could have a different perception of the term "reasonable delay". I have in mind periods of the council cycle, such as August, when education authorities sometimes do no meet, and where a two-month delay without councils having responded may be considered reasonable. Will pressure be put on the LEAs by the Secretary of State to respond to a request to resolve matters? There is no pressure on the Department for Education and Employment to respond within two months. It occurs to me that while that interference was taking place, we might lengthen the process whereby an LEA responded and that that might not happen if the governing body did not make representations to the Secretary of State.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 135</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Characteristically, the hon. Lady has made reasonable and proper points. The answer to the first is yes, probably. My only hesitation about it is that as she knows, the entire British legal system is based on the concept of reasonable and reasonableness. There has always been a slight danger of trying to pin down too precisely in words what is, or is not, reasonable. However, I am pretty confident that we would wish to give whatever guidance was appropriate in that respect to help governors decide what was reasonable. The hon. Lady has made a very positive suggestion.<br><br>
As to whether there should be time limits, either formal or not, on the Secretary of State in making her dispositions, I can assure the hon. Lady that these days all Government Departments and Secretaries of State are extremely conscious of judicial review, especially in the matter of unreasonable delays. No Department or Secretary of State that I can reasonably, if not optimistically, envisage holding that office would want to be party to unreasonable delays to this part of the procedure. I give the hon. Member for Yardley the assurance that she seeks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's assurance, but what he said underlines the fact that legislation already exists for the Secretary of State to do what she feels is necessary in the circumstances that apply to a particular school. Although I am prepared to withdraw the amendment, I should be happier if the Minister would agree to a time other than two months, which is not workable. Is it sufficient time if the local authority says that it has referred the request to the education committee, which is engaged in consultation? Obviously, the governing body of the school would decide, but referral is the only action that could be expected within two months, as the process could not be completed in that time. It would depend, too, on the time of year at which the request was made, because governing bodies meet very seldom in some two-month periods during the year. It would be far better to have a more realistic time limit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Our judgement, based on departmental experience, is that two months is the proper and appropriate period in the circumstances. At this stage, I would be reluctant to change it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I shall press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p>7.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 45, in page 54, line 28, leave out 'general'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 46, in page 54, line 28, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>'with a view to admitting only pupils with high ability'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments affect paragraph (5) of schedule 1. They involve words that have come up previously in the Committee—ability and aptitude. The Bill proposes that children may be admitted to schools according to their ability or aptitude at more or less any age from four to 16. Paragraph (5) distinguishes between "ability" and "high ability" in line 28. Aptitude is not mentioned, but the paragraph gives us a chance to explore what Ministers mean by ability and aptitude. I realise that in dealing with an amendment that applies only to specialist schools the Minister may refer to aptitudes for particular specialisms.<br><br>
The distinction being made here is new. Ability and aptitude have been seen previously as ranges that apply to all children. One could not say that some children have ability; all children have some ability and some aptitude in some direction or other. The question is over the definition of the terms. There appears to have been some change since Butler's Education Act 1944.<br><br>
The Bill's notions are problematic. The Bill assumes that we understand exactly what ability and aptitude mean and that we can measure them with sufficient confidence to ensure fairness in determining whether a child should be admitted to a particular school. I want the Minister to spell out his definitions.<br><br>
When I last taught in school, I was in the United States where schools are familiar with scholastic aptitude tests. Students making the transition from high school to college take SATs that give them a score on a scale from 200 to 800. It is actually a scale from 0 to 1,000, but, it being America, no score is reported lower than 200 or higher than 800. I found that my students' scores correlated pretty well with what I thought of their potential.<br><br>
At college level in the United States, far more emphasis is placed on those aptitude tests than on achievement tests. Our system relies heavily on tests of achievement. What tests of aptitude do we have, particularly in specialist schools? A lot of expertise is required to develop tests that properly show children's potential. A measure of what children over a wide age range have learned up to a given point in time cannot be easily translated into a measure of aptitude.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0175">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 137</span>
That point is illustrated by the failure of the system that we have swept away. The system of grammar and secondary modern schools in most parts of the country, and of grammar, technical and secondary schools in others, was based on certain assumptions. First, it was assumed that different children were suited to different curricula. A different range of subjects was taught to the children in different types of school because of the judgments made about them at the age of 11. Secondly, it was assumed that different needs had developed by the age of 11. Thirdly, it was thought that it was possible to allocate children accurately between the different types of school by the use of so-called intelligence tests.<br><br>
We know that that system made many mistakes. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) has already said that it made a mistake about him. We find it difficult to believe that the system deduced that he was suitable for a mundane curriculum. As he explained, his achievements in his company showed very clearly that he was a person of high ability. Ability, as measured by the so-called intelligence tests, failed to select the hon. Gentleman. That is just one example of how any testing system has its limitations. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the Government should state clearly what they mean by aptitude and ability.<br><br>
Other factors make the words a bit meaningless. The Government have accepted, and introduced, a national curriculum. That works on the basis that all children should have a broadly based education and should acquire in sufficient depth a general core of knowledge. We have moved away from the assumption that children should study different curricula according to their abilities.<br><br>
Furthermore, we no longer believe that intelligence is fixed at a point in time—especially at the age of 11—and that ability and aptitude cannot change and develop over time. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth was like a number of other hon. Members and people of unquestionable ability whom the Minister and I meet in everyday life. They failed at one point in time. Given that fact, we should ensure that the system cannot penalise people because of the mistakes that are made about children of the age of 11.<br><br>
In particular, tests at the age of 11 were very poor predictors of performance at the age of 16 and, certainly, of performance in later life. Many children suffered under the system that I have described; the Government must be clear about the basis of their proposals for selection. It is no good just assuming that we all know what we mean by ability and aptitude. If we proceed from that assumption, it is likely that great errors will be made when applying the system.<br><br>
It is significant that the City Technology Trust has recently commissioned the National Foundation for Educational Research to develop tests of aptitude. How will we know, when a science specialist school chooses a child of 11 on the basis of an aptitude test, that there has been no confusion between a child who has scored highly because he or she has natural ability in science, or has scored highly because of the good teaching he or she received? My hon. Friend the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 138</span>
Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) referred to the fact that schools cram children when they know that they will take a particular test. How can we put children on an equal footing? It is important that we have the right definition.<br><br>
I am not confident that the measures are appropriate for achieving the aim that we have been discussing. Perhaps a specialist music school would have a better chance than other specialist schools, because it could at least assess performance. Nevertheless, the Government should be clear. We must have confidence that the tests will be more appropriate and more accurate than those that condemned millions of children—not the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth because he was able to escape. One or two others also got away from incorrect selection. We must ensure that such selection does not happen again and that the Government do not turn the clock back.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Staffordshire, South-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What keeps striking me is a question to which I have not received an answer. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth said that he did not receive the sort of education in which he could have succeeded because he did not pass the 11-plus—many of us did not pass. When we sat the 11-plus, and some went off to grammar schools, those who were directed to secondary modern education did not sit the matriculation or 0-level examinations. In the 1960s, approximately 22 per cent. of the population passed those examinations. They were the only ones, according to the selection process, who were fit and able to attain the dizzy heights of five 0-levels. Nowadays, our youngsters' IQ seems to have doubled, because 44 per cent. obtain five GCSEs. In the days of the grammar school system, 100 per cent. of pupils did not obtain such qualifications.<br><br>
Education is for life. My hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) said that he saw 30 and 35-year old undergraduates at university. It was their first opportunity to attend university. Our ability intelligence, or IQ, seems to alter constantly throughout our lives. Therefore, how can we claim that a selection process will benefit our young people and our country? It is a fallacy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been patient with the hon. Gentleman. His intervention has been rather lengthy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for South-East Staffordshire (Mr. Jenkins) clearly outlined the system's deficiencies. It is different from the aptitude tests that are used in the United States for students who consider going to college. A much higher percentage of students attend college in the United States. The results of one specific aptitude test do not matter because there are a range of colleges to which students can apply. The colleges all publish what they expect from the people they accept. A student would be certain to get into some colleges, lucky to get into others, while others would just suit the student's ability. That happens when a country has a college system that caters for a wide range of aptitude.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0176">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 139</span>
However, as my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Staffordshire said, our system will use selection at a cut-off point for some students. Their opportunity to progress and fulfil their potential will thus be reduced.<br><br>
The Government should define aptitude and ability clearly. They should explain how they would expect the tests to be used, for example, in this instance, when we are talking about a specialist school, but also generally, when there is selection. I should like the Government to make it clear how they would apply this and how they would measure ability and aptitude.</span></p>
<p>7.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill is designed to increase diversity of schools and to give schools the maximum freedom to respond to parents' wishes for their children. That surely means giving as many parents as possible the opportunity to choose from a range of schools of different types. This is familiar ground and the Committee is well aware that that aim underlies the Bill.<br><br>
Included in that is the fact the Government consider grammar schools to be an essential part of a fully diversified school system. The Bill allows governors of county schools to publish statutory proposals to turn their school into a grammar school, where they have requested the LEA to publish such proposals and, after two months, the LEA has not responded constructively to their request. We have dealt with the appropriate procedure before.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 45 and 46 would extend the circumstances in which county schools could publish their own proposals to all cases where county schools had asked the LEA to publish proposals to admit all pupils by reference to ability and the LEA had not responded constructively. That would include cases where a school wished to select all pupils on the grounds of ability in a particular subject or subjects and where a school wished to select all pupils with reference to any level of ability.<br><br>
It may be slightly surprising to members of the Committee, but the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South appears to want to increase the scope for county schools to publish proposals to introduce or extend selection. That would be the effect of his amendment. I assume that he may want to make it easier for schools to select by any level of ability, not just high ability which was the aspect of the amendment which he identified early on. I can assure him that clause 4 and paragraph (2) of schedule 1 provide for that. Indeed, I would go further and say that there is nothing to prevent the admission authority for the school from selecting pupils of average or below average ability up to its threshold. It could do that without statutory proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I read them, the amendments are probing to see how the Government are defining terms in the Bill and how that differs from the way they were used in the Education Act 1944. The terms "ability" and "aptitude" were used differently in that Act from
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
the way they are used here. That is why the terms "general ability" and "high ability" are being questioned. In the past, one could have been able and gone to a secondary modern because one was able in certain subjects. One could have gone to an old-fashioned tech when they were around. We need to know how "high ability" is to be measured. We need an explanation of how the definitions have changed since the 1944 Act and what the implications will be for schools were they to select.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the hon. Lady wanting that level of detail in legislation. It seems to be a constant desire of Opposition Members to see as much detail as possible in statute. I think that I am right in saying that ability or aptitude have never been defined in statute. "High ability" is a convenient shorthand for grammer, if I can put it that way. The sort of tests for general ability are well established in the existing grammer school system and are well understood. Much of the approach that is taken to testing by grammer schools is based on National Foundation for Education Research work.<br><br>
When it comes to aptitude, it is fair to say that different types of specialist schools are developing different approaches to the measurement of aptitude to see what is most appropriate to their specialism—music, mathematics or whatever. That can vary enormously. I cannot imagine that it would make any sense to include in the Bill, as the hon. Member for Barking seemed to suggest, a definition of ability or aptitude. I should have thought that that was sufficiently understood throughout the education system, where testing for ability for grammer school entry is long established and, I am delighted to say, continues in the many parts of the country where there are still grammer schools—140 or so of them, and we hope for more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Kilfoyle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Walton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In Bromley?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All over the country. I am happy for Committee members proudly to announce the names of grammer schools in their areas. My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall) wants to do just that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Marshall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that Q.E. Boy's school in the London borough of Barnet has now become a selective school since becoming grant maintained? Does he agree that there would not be a grammar school left in the country if the Conservative party had not won the 1979 general election, because the Labour party forced local authorities to destroy them, against parents', teachers' and governors' wishes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend who has illustrated an important point: whereas Conservative Members are content for grammar schools to emerge naturally where a demand is established in the community, Opposition Members would presumably want to close grammar schools by force and end the excellent education that they have provided.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0177">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister now answer the question that was put to him on Second Reading? Did not Lady Thatcher close more grammar schools than any other Secretary of State for Education?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What Baroness Thatcher did, in her distinguished career as Secretary of State for Education and Science and, more particularly, as Prime Minister, is interesting, but it does not necessarily inform our work on the Bill. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) may not have noticed, but the odd thing has changed since Baroness Thatcher was Secretary of State for Education and Science and we have moved on in several important ways. The Bill is an attempt to build on our achievements, to bring about genuine diversification of the education system and to recognise the possibility of selection by, where appropriate, ability or apititude testing, but not to include their definition in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept that for a long time there was a consensus under which Labour and Conservative Secretaries of State were happy to close grammar schools? Does not the Conservative Education Association still very much oppose the notion of a grammar school in every town and embrace the comprehensive principle?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members keep on quoting the Conservative Education Association as if it were something with meaning and substance. I am unaware of the activities of that organisation. I do not think that I have ever met the gentleman who claims to run it. It has little influence on the Government's thinking on educational matters. If Opposition Members want to persist in quoting that organisation they are free to do so, but this is the only time that I shall rise to that bait. Hereafter I shall not waste my and the Committee's time by answering such interventions about what it allegedly says, thinks or does. Perhaps that one can be laid to rest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister said a few minutes ago is interesting. I admit to being a little confused about Government policy on grammar schools and selection. I understand that the Secretary of State told a meeting in Norfolk in 1994 that there would not be a change in the status quo and that the creation of more grammar schools was not Government policy. The Minister said the other day, in Committee, that the legislation was permissive and that he was not in favour of or against an increase in selection. He said a few minutes ago that he intended and desired grammar schools to increase in number. All kinds of policy have been offered to us. What is the Government's stance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government's policy is perfectly clear: where there is a demand for grammar school education we wish to facilitate it. That is the point of the Bill. We have made it clear that grammar schools have an important part to play in improving the quality and standards of education in this country—as do specialist schools and colleges. In wanting more diversification and richness in our education system, as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
opposed to the bland uniformity of the comprehensive education so much beloved of Opposition Members, we are on to a winner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before we have any more interventions along these lines, I remind the Committee that the substantive content of the amendment involves a definition of ability, and not the principle of selection. I have allowed several interventions and subsequent debates along those lines, but the Committee should return to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. That allows me to resume my response to the amendments. I think that I had reached paragraph 5 of my notes.<br><br>
I assume that Opposition Members also want to make it easier for schools to select all pupils by reference to different levels of ability, with the aim of achieving a banded intake. It is open to schools to use relevant thresholds to secure a particular band. It is also open to county schools to negotiate banded admissions with their local education authority. But it is right for the special arrangements allowing the county schools to publish their own proposals to be confined to schools wishing to become grammar schools—for the reason that grammar schools are a different and clearly identifiable category, and they select on the basis of ability and of the tests that I mentioned a moment ago.<br><br>
Therefore, the amendment—if the intention of the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South is what I think it is—is unnecessary. It would run counter to the Government's aim of allowing grammar schools to develop in a proper context, as set out in the Bill, and of allowing the maximum freedom to other schools that, without seeking grammar school status, want an element of selection in their admissions policies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak to this amendment, but I shall do so, even though the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) is desperate to get off and do something else.<br><br>
The Minister's brief does not respond to the unease that caused the amendments to be tabled. The Minister's contention is far from the truth: there is no desire to define "general" ability or "high" ability. The amendments would remove the words "general" and "higher" from the face of the Bill. Opposition Members are worried that the inclusion of those words will cause the Bill to do what the Minister previously said that he does not want, which is to ensure that only those children who are selected at five or 11 and who show something called "high ability"—the Minister says that we all know what the phrase means—will be considered valuable in education. <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee will have noticed that I try to chair our proceedings without being excessively magisterial. On a number of occasions, I have appealed for reason concerning the amount of conversation cutting across the debate. There is too much such conversation, and I appeal once again for reason.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara.<br><br>
The Bill will establish an elitism and a heirarchy in schools. The Minister has said that he does not want that. He has said that schools are to be viewed equally, regardless of whether they are secondary modern schools or grammar schools. But when we start talking about only high-ability children gaining access to a particular institution we are by definition creating an elite. It is because we do not want that to occur that the two words should be omitted. I would go further: if the Minister looked at the 1944 Act to see how words such as "ability" and "aptitude" were used, he would realise that he is putting forward a new definition in the Bill. We are not seeking a definition in the Bill but want to remove those words to ensure that there is consistency in the Government's thinking and that doors are not closed to children, either at five or 11, by defining one group as having high ability and aptitude and another as not.</span></p>
<p>7.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will not the hon. Lady admit that the worst form of slamming of doors is that which takes place in Islington where, for most children, the education is quite subnormal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What? I missed the last part of the hon. Gentleman's contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The standard of education is quite inadequate and subnormal, and so indifferent that many parents choose to have their children educated outside the borough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am appalled by the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that the children who attend Islington schools are subnormal. [HON. MEMBERS: "The education is subnormal."] I am appalled that any Conservative Member would dare, when we should be in pursuit of opportunity for all, to classify a particular range of children as subnormal. If Conservative Members want to base their education policy and the content of the debate—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a minute. I was about to respond to the hon. Gentleman's previous point.<br><br>
If Conservative Members want to focus their contributions to the debate on Islington—[HON. MEMBERS: "Yes."] That demonstrates that they have no interest whatever in using the Bill to raise standards in education in all our schools. The only purpose behind the Bill is to pursue some silly, cheap political jibes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not mean that the children were subnormal, but that the results of their education were subnormal. If one examines the record, that is shown very clearly. Conservative Members object to lectures on standards and results from the hon. Member for Barking. Islington, which has been controlled by the Labour party through the Inner London education authority and Islington Labour council—new Labour—for 25 years, has appalling results.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 144</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I—[HON. MEMBERS: "ANSWER."]I will indeed answer and continue to focus on Islington if that is the petty-minded way in which Conservative Members want to proceed. It is most interesting that the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw)—I am reluctant to use that term—always becomes most enthusiastic in debates in Committee or in the Chamber when he deals not with issues but with the lowest form of politics.<br><br>
I say, yet again, to the hon. Member for Hendon, South that to describe anybody, whatever the results in Islington, as educationally subnormal as the outcome—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I heard the term "subnormal". If Conservative Members want me to talk about education I will. The hon. Gentleman described the outcome for many children who attend Islington schools as "subnormal". He should reflect on that word and withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could have used the term "below average" and referred to the latest results tables to prove my point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has withdrawn his use of the term "subnormal" and adopted the term "below average". As I have said on previous occasions, there is enormous room for improvement in many of our inner-city schools. The sad fact that is emerging from the contributions of Conservative Members, whether made from a sedentary position or on their feet, is that they are simply not interested in the Bill or in attempting to take the important steps that we should be taking to raise standards in our schools, particularly those in inner cities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady never did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wants to get up and intervene, I shall be happy to listen to him. I find sedentary, loud-mouth interventions somewhat offensive. Returning to the amendment—[<i>Interruption.</i>] Does the hon. Member for Dover wish to intervene?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Lady concludes, I advise the Committee that I allowed that set of interventions to proceed because debate arose about the use of the word "subnormal", which is an outmoded term in education. However, it is relevant to the content of the amendment, which is definition of ability. We should allow the hon. Member for Barking to conclude her contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to your sagacious advice, Mr. O'Hara. We seek from the Minister a definition of what is meant by high ability. Will the Bill, as Opposition Members suspect, establish a hierarchy of ability and of schools? If that is so, the Bill does not demonstrate a commitment by the Government to ensuring equal opportunity for all our children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a rather more lengthy debate than I had anticipated. This is a probing amendment, with which we have tried to elucidate what the Government mean when they talk about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0179">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
ability and aptitude, how they will apply those terms in particular circumstances and what advice or guidance they will give to schools.<br><br>
People will not receive much guidance from observing the Committee, but it has been a useful discussion. My hon. Friend the Member for Barking has brought out certain features of the Government's attitude to the Bill. It is regrettable that they are not prepared properly to discuss the issues. The brief that was given to the Minister did not deal with the point. There have certainly been different demonstrations of ability—my hon. Friend the Member for Barking has found that the hon. Member for Dover is at least able to demonstrate in Committee, as he is in the House, the fact that he has extremely high ability in personal abuse. He has been unable to demonstrate an ability in sustained argument on educational issues.<br><br>
I will withdraw the amendments because they were probing amendments. The Minister used them to suggest that we agreed with everything else in the schedule, but he knows that that is not true. Matters relating to selection have been dealt with or will be dealt with in discussions on other amendments, and his suggestion was unwise. Nor was he right to suggest in a discussion which you Mr. O'Hara, rightly pointed out was rather off the main thrust of the amendment, that we would automatically reject schools that catered specifically for children of high ability.<br><br>
I recall visiting many schools in West Yorkshire as part of my job when I worked at the university. I visited schools that were grammar schools by virtue of their grant-maintained status and I also visited those, especially during the 1970s, that had been retained as local authority grammar schools. Curiously, those local authority grammar schools—including Heckmondwike and the school at Normanton—have retained their status. They are in Labour-controlled authorities.<br><br>
The Minister should examine the history of education in Leeds. If he did, he would find that the Conservatives played a large role in introducing the comprehensive system in Leeds. Councillor Crotty recognised the value of comprehensive schools and he acknowledged what they had contributed to the educational needs of the city and its children. Many Conservatives—not just the Secretary of State who was based in her former days in Norfolk—worked hard to ensure that the comprehensive system was effective in their areas.<br><br>
It is regrettable that the Government appear to have endorsed the view that excellence is primarily to be defined by reference to selection. As I said earlier, I visited many schools and they often maintained excellent standards. I was particularly concerned with the teaching of science, especially chemistry. I saw how many good schools developed pupils' knowledge of the subject. Independent, ex-direct grant schools selected on the basis of ability. However, some comprehensive schools also achieved high standards.<br><br>
I recommend that the Minister considers those cases and carefully examines the overall performance of schools. For example, Shelley high school—a local education authority comprehensive school—reached
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
excellent standards in science, comparing favourably with schools that are regarded as the most satisfactory direct grant schools in the area.<br><br>
The Minister should ensure that in the guidance he gives to schools, he shows some understanding of the definitions of ability and aptitude. We should have clarity on the issue, but although our debate may have provided some clarity about the Government's views, it has provided only further confusion about the selection process and how it will operate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 62, in page 54, line 32, leave out "towards complying with" and insert "in considering".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may consider amendment No. 3, in page 54, line 32, leave out "may themselves" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"shall consult the Secretary of State before they".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking to the amendments because the hon. Member for Bath has had to leave us. The amendments deal with important issues which we should explore. We have told the Government from the outset that the Bill falls into two parts. One is about the political aspirations of the Government as they prepare the next general election campaign. The second part deals with more substantive issues upon which there is much agreement. We want to explore further the sections of the Bill that can be strengthened.<br><br>
It is important for Conservative Members to take seriously what is implicit in part I and to consider the effect that it will have on the life chances of millions of our children if it becomes statute. It ill behoves Conservative Members to indulge in barracking Opposition Members, who take the issue extremely seriously.<br><br>
8 pm<br><br>
The amendments would apply to a county secondary school that asked its LEA to publish proposals for significant change to allow all pupils to be admitted by selection. As it stands, the schedule would allow such a school to go it alone if it felt that the LEA had delayed unreasonably. I stress that we mean the school; often in these cases, we turn out to be talking about a particular individual—perhaps the head teacher, the chair of governors or another dominant personality at the school.<br><br>
The amendments would simply require the Secretary of State to be consulted before a school went it alone. Talk of consultation is something of a collective cliché in the Committee. During this morning's debate on primary schools, the Minister said that we tended to undertake consultation before we knew what consultation to undertake. That notwithstanding, consultation is a sine qua non for a consensual way of conducting ourselves, in education and elsewhere. It is, therefore, not unreasonable to ask the Minister why the Secretary of State should not be consulted in such cases. Why do the Government feel
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0180">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
that allowing individual schools to go it alone without referring to anyone else will contribute to a fair, democratic and effective education system?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Voluntary and grant-maintained schools can publish their own proposals to become 100 per cent. selective; under existing legislation, county schools cannot. The Bill is designed to make it easier to set up grammar schools where parents want that. We want county schools to have an equal chance to become grammar schools.<br><br>
If the governing body wants a school to become a grammar school, it must start by asking the local education authority to publish statutory proposals to that effect. If the LEA agrees or negotiates alternative arrangements with the governing body, there should be no problem. Schedule 1(5) is intended to deal with a situation in which the local education authority wants to block the governors' plans for the school to become a grammar school. That is why sub-paragraph (2) gives the governing body the right to publish its own proposals if the LEA has not made satisfactory progress towards complying with the governors' request two months or more after receiving it.<br><br>
It is important to note that "complying" in this case means action, not words. It means that the LEA must consult on and publish proposals, not just debate whether the governors' request is a good idea. Amendment No. 62 would mean that the LEA could use words to prevent governors from publishing their own proposal. If, for example, the education committee discussed the governors' request during the two-month period, it would be difficult for governors to argue that the local education authority had not made satisfactory progress in considering—that is the word that the amendment uses—their request because the LEA would have considered it, perhaps even at great length. Even if the way was clear for the governing body to publish its own statutory proposals, amendment No. 3 would require it to consult the Secretary of State before it did so. That introduces an unnecesasry complication into the proceedings.<br><br>
The amendment would undermine or subvert—I understand why it seeks to do this—the new and deliberately chosen path to grammar school status in cases where schools met with deliberate obstruction from the local education authority. The choice of words in the amendment is clever and deliberate and the amendment could, therefore, have the effect that I have described and block indefinitely the progress of proposals. For that reason, and because it undermines the thrust of this part of the Bill, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am quite used to the Minister's paranoia about local education authorities. Requiring the individual school in the scenario that the Minister outlined to consult with the Secretary of State would, however, be a simple and effective check. I do not believe that the Secretary of State will suddenly be flooded with hundreds, if not thousands, of similar cases. The Minister obviously fears that, simply
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
because the Labour party and, in some places, the Liberal Democrats, dominate local government to the exclusion of this own party. It would seem to be to the Government's advantage to allow schools in that situation to consult them. It would not present any barrier to the avowed intention of allowing those county secondary schools to go for grammar school status. It is a mechanism simply to ensure that—in the Minister's terms—in the unlikely eventuality of a school being entirely out of order with the intention behind the Bill, there could be a check before it takes that final step. I can explain it only in the Minister's words—this fear that the Government have of anything and everything to do with LEAs. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I advise the Committee that on the list of the provisional selection, amendments Nos. 48 and 41 are grouped together. In fact, I intend to call them separately.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 48, in page 54, line 42, leave out from beginning to end of line 5 on page 55.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment is to prevent the Secretary of State from being placed under a duty to consider together parallel change of character proposals for a school published by the LEA and by the governing body of the school, thus removing the possibility of an additional delay in the determination of the LEA proposals by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The provisions that the amendment would delete gives no additional powers to any of the parties involved in change of character proposals, but places the Secretary of State under a duty to consider together parallel sets of such proposals. That could be used by a governing body simply to delay the determination of perfectly sound LEA proposals by timing the publication of its own proposals for the end of the two-month objection period on the LEA proposals, thus preventing the Secretary of State from considering the matter until the end of the objection period for the governors' proposals. That could cause a delay of a further two months in determining proposals which could delay implementation by a full year.<br><br>
Sub-paragraphs 4 and 5 of the schedule, which the amendment would delete, quite gratuitously tie the hands of the Secretary of State without adding to the powers of any of the parties involved that arise elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill gives governors of county schools the right to publish their own statutory proposals where their LEA has blocked, delayed or undermined their plans to turn the school into a grammar school.<br><br>
County schools' right to publish proposals will include circumstances in which, in response to governors' request to the LEA to publish proposals to make the school 100 per cent. selective, the LEA has published proposals to vary a school's admission arrangements, but not in the way that the governors
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0181">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 149</span>
have requested. For example, an LEA could publish proposals for, 50 per cent. selection, or proposals that would frustrate the governors' plans in some other way, such as changing the school's catchment area. Where the governors consider that the LEA's proposals do not amount to satisfactory progress towards complying with their request, and therefore publish their own proposals, both sets of proposals will be decided by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
Amendment No. 48 would remove the requirement for the Secretary of State to consider both sets of proposals together. In my experience, that would be entirely impractical. The circumstances in which the governing body of a county school will be able to publish its own proposals, when proposals have already been published by the LEA, inevitably mean that the two sets of proposals will conflict. It makes absolute sense in those circumstances for the Secretary of State to consider the two sets of proposals together. How else could the conflict between the proposals be properly considered?<br><br>
I believe that the amendment does not make sense—intentionally or not, I do not know—in terms of the practical way in which a conflicting set of proposals, which is what we are talking about, by definition, would have to be considered together. That is in the nature of the process, and to seek to deny it would make a nonsense of the part of the Bill that we are discussing. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 41, in page 55, line 5, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(6) The Secretary of State shall, before determining proposals for a change of character published under sub-paragraph (2), consult the local education authority and have regard to its advice.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(7) The Secretary of State shall publish criteria for the determination of proposals under this paragraph and shall have regard to them in reaching any such determination.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(8) The criteria to which sub-paragraph (7) above refers shall include—
<ol>
<li>the desirability of maintaining choice in admissions to parents of all children in the relevant age-group in the area;</li>
<li>the undesirability of adversely affecting admissions to other schools in the same area or those of neighbouring education authorities;</li>
<li>the promotion of opportunities for pupils in the area who have special educational needs; and</li>
<li>the optimal number of surplus places.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
I said to you earlier, Mr. O'Hara, that I could not understand why amendments Nos. 48 and 41 have been grouped together. They clearly differed substantially. Amendment No. 41 would ensure that decisions by the Secretary of State to allow a county school to become a grammar school against the wishes of its maintaining LEA are taken according to published criteria and only after—this dreaded word again—consultation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
This part of the Bill is deeply problematic. It will subvert the proper duty of the dreaded LEA as admissions authority by allowing an individual school to become fully selective on its own initiative and against the wishes of its admissions authority. The amendment would ameliorate that difficulty by requiring the Secretary of State to follow published criteria when determining such cases and to consult the LEA before doing so.<br><br>
The unfettered extension of selection could easily be a great disadvantage to certain parents and pupils, a theme that we have explored already—some might say ad nauseam—in our deliberations. The change of character of an existing school to admit a different set of pupils must mean that some pupils who would expect to be granted a place under existing policies would in future fail to achieve their choice of school. Again, there is a conflict between choice and diversity. It can be lessened only by striving for a proper balance.<br><br>
If local circumstances were such that there was no other suitable school in the vicinity of certain pupils, they could be faced with a lengthy journey to a possibly inappropriate school. I say possibly because we will not know for certain until the system is put into practice. The unco-ordinated nature of admissions policies could lead to all schools within reasonable travelling distance being barred to particular individuals.<br><br>
An allegation has been made about the Minister's putative seat of Bromley where, because of the cross-border incursions of pupils into Bromley schools, which have all gone selective, local pupils will be deprived of their place in that borough. It is essential that the Secretary of State should have regard to the overriding need to ensure that a free place is available to every pupil who requires one in his or her given area. Children with special education needs are particularly vulnerable and could be disadvantaged. There are many additional reasons, which I am sure we shall explore later, why certain schools may not be appropriate for them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would require the Secretary of State to consult the LEA and to have regard to its advice before determining the governors' proposals. It would also require the Secretary of State to have regard to certain published criteria in coming to her decision.<br><br>
The first requirement, for the Secretary of State to consult the LEA is unnecessary. Arrangements for the publication, approval and implementation of proposals will be almost identical to those that already apply to voluntary schools. That means that the LEA will have a statutory right of objection to any proposals that are published by the governors of a county school and, as now, the Secretary of State will take all objections into account in determining proposals. Therefore, a separate requirement for the Secretary of State to consult the LEA before determining governors' proposals would only delay her consideration. The LEA will have ample opportunity to make representations about any concerns it may have during the two-month period for objections.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0182">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 151</span>
The second requirement, for the Secretary of State to have regard to criteria set out in primary legislation, would fetter her discretion in determining proposals and I see no reason for it. The criteria for determining proposals from voluntary and grant-maintained schools for 100 per cent. selection are not set out in statute. The provision is intended to create a level playing field for county schools in that respect. The Secretary of State considers all proposals on their merits and in considering proposals from county schools for 100 per cent. selection, she will as a matter of course take into account all the relevant factors, including the contribution that the proposals will make to increasing the choice, diversity and quality of education in the area.<br><br>
The amendment would add an unnecessary step to the Secretary of State's consideration of the proposals, and would create an inconsistency with the equivalent arrangements for voluntary and grant-maintained schools. I therefore urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p>8.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find that response somewhat unsatisfactory, to put it mildly. I cannot begin to understand why the Government are so afraid of any checks whatsoever on the process. They appear to see everything as an obstacle designed to cater for interests other than those of the ideologues on the Government Benches. That reinforces my view that the provisions have nothing to do with practical education and policy but a great deal to do with ideology and campaigning toward the next election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we are exploring the psyche or motivation of the Government and Conservative Members, let me tell the hon. Gentleman that we have all been scarred by the experience of what LEAs throughout the country have done to intervene in the grant-maintained process. If the hon. Gentleman detects a degree of hesitation—or even, perhaps, a little suspicion—on our part about the motivation of certain people in LEAs, their behaviour in intervening in the process to determine grant-maintained status may go some way toward explaining what the hon. Gentleman finds so difficult to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the Minister being a little afraid of local democracy—after all, when I gave up counting about 22 months ago, I had already counted 220 pieces of legislation enacted by recent Conservative Governments designed to subvert local democracy. It is understandable that people without a belief in something, and certainly without a controlling interest in it—the Conservative party is about nothing if not control, whether in national or local government—succumb to the paranoia that has obviously taken hold of the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us swap subversions. The mechanism for balloting for grant-maintained status in a school is a pure form of local democracy—as local as one can get—with parents in a school being allowed to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 152</span>
participate in a crucial decision-making process. That process has repeatedly been subverted by LEAs seeking to intervene in it. If we are talking about subversion, I am aware of all too many examples of it in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to stray from the amendments, Mr. O'Hara. We shall deal later with further proposals concerning grant-maintained status ballots. Will the Minister tell us how many complaints he has received—and how many of those have been acted on—concerning the reverse of the process to which he referred? I am personally aware of cases in which not only local authorities but local councillors and governors have been deliberately and gratuitously frozen out of the process by people who received active sustenance and support from agencies set up by the Government to enhance the grant-maintained movement.<br><br>
I have nothing against people exercising their ballot in a free, fair and open way; I have everything against a one-sided perspective that does not reflect reality being forced down people's throats. If the Minister's remarks are part of a pretext to explain away the failure of the prediction of the right hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Mr. Patten) that by now more than half our schools would be grant-maintained, I am afraid that they will fall on deaf ears among the electorate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recall asking the Minister how many ballots the Department has asked to be re-run because of improper practices? Has my hon. Friend yet received a reply from the Minister?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. My hon. Friend is right to point that out, because I do not believe that the Minister can give a reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two out of all those ballots. Of course, that will not matter to the Minister, because I believe that the record will show that this morning, when we discussed primary schools, the Minister said that he does not care about the detail, once he has provided the options. Yet when it comes to providing options concerning grant-maintained schools, the Government also provide all the support necessary to get momentum going behind them.<br><br>
I noted what the Minister said earlier about the demand for grammar schools and selection. It is his right and privilege as a Minister to make that option available, but he seems highly selective in the options he is prepared to make available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend share my surprise that after the tirade we heard from the Minister last week, two ballots had to be re-run?

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think Mr. O'Hara, that you would take kindly to my speculating on those matters at this stage. However, the Minister is certainly a little specious in his approach to grant-maintained schools and to the relationship between the ballots and LEA's activities. I well recall various Conservative Members raising groundless allegations against a school in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), the Leader of the Opposition which were withdrawn when it was shown that they were without foundation. After those Conservative Members had used the privilege of the Floor of the House to make the most disgraceful allegations about intimidation and the LEA's conduct, the headmaster of the school concerned had to disabuse the people of this country about the allegations.<br><br>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 55, line 13, leave out "and" and insert "or
<br><blockquote><p>(iii) make provision for the termination of the admission of pupils by reference to ability or aptitude".</p></blockquote>
I am surprised that the amendment stands, rather oddly, on its own. It makes greater sense if seen with amendments that we shall move to later to clauses 2, 4 and 8. Its intention is to ensure that just as schools that are currently not selective will have a duty under the Bill to go through a procedure to decide whether they want to introduce selection, schools that are currently grammar schools—and thus have selection—will have to undergo the same processes and be treated in exactly the same way, both in regard to consultation and to reviewing their admission procedures.<br><br>
Given that the Minister has frequently said that the powers provided in the Bill are permissive and that he and the Government are anxious to ensure choice and diversity, it seems to us that consistency is demanded, that permissiveness should exist for schools that are currently grammar schools and that choice and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 154</span>
diversity for them should be the order of the day. Amendment No. 29 makes sense in relation to the others.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our reading of the amendment was not quite what the hon. Lady proposed. I shall try to explain what we believed she sought; perhaps we shall finish in the same place, as there seems to be no difference between us on the matter.<br><br>
Our reading of the amendment was that it sought to apply the provisions of the Bill to the effective ending of selection. Having taken high-powered legal advice, we reached the conclusion that the effect of the preceding provision found in paragraph 6(1) (a) (ii), relating to the alteration of the proportion of pupils to be selected, included altering it to zero—that is, doing away with selection altogether, which is what the hon. Lady seeks. In other words, I am saying that the amendment is unnecessary. I am advised that what she seeks is already provided, although it is somewhat buried in paragraph 6(1) (a) (ii).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that reassurance. I was advised by the Clerk that, to be consistent, the provision should be made in all the relevant parts of the Bill. On the understanding that there is already consistency in the treatment of all schools, whether or not they are selective, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 55, leave out lines 17 to 19 and insert—

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 155</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are back again on the question of consultation as it appears in paragraph 6 of schedule 1. The wonderful arrangements that the Government appear to be making when a change to selection arrangements is to be made that does not require the proposals to be published, mean that the admissions authority can make such arrangements as appear to it to be appropriate. That seems to mean that the authority can do whatever it pleases, as it is the authority's judgment whether the arrangements are appropriate. The wording is so loose that it almost invites a judicial review. Legislation that leaves such gateways wide open should be avoided.<br><br>
We understand the Government's problem on consultation; their track record is hardly perfect. In a previous life, I was on the other end of Government consultation. I remember the Government asking local authorities such questions as, "Is the poll tax a good idea?", yet when they received a 100 per cent. response that it was not, they carried on regardless.<br><br>
The Government have devised a variety of ways to get around the difficulty that consultation may not always produce the results that they want. In their proposals on industrial relations, instead of looking for majority agreement among those voting in ballots, they are considering demanding a majority among those eligible to vote. In a famous debate on a Housing Act, when discussing the potential opting out by tenants from local authority control, the Government even looked for a majority of eligible people to vote no in order for a consultation not to proceed in a certain direction.<br><br>
It seems that the Government have decided that the best way to avoid consultation going against them is to say that those who are consulting can decide who to consult. In other words, if they think that they will get a result from someone that is contrary to their proposals, they will not consult him. In the end, it is for the admissions authority to decide who to consult.<br><br>
The Minister will doubtless say that paragraph 6(3) provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"the admission authority shall have regard to any guidance given from time to time by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
That is fine, but "have regard to" does not mean that he has to follow it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister can say that from a sedentary position, why does not the Bill say that the authority should follow the guidance? The words "have regard to" simply mean that the authority has to take account of the guidance, not that it must implement it in detail. The authority can read it and judge whether it fits the situation.<br><br>
8.30 pm<br><br>
If it is the Government's intention that the Secretary of State's guidance must be followed, why did not the Bill state that the admission authority should carry out consultations according to the
<br><blockquote><p>"guidance given from time to time by the Secretary of State"</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 156</span>
or that it should follow the Secretary of State's guidance? Paragraph 6(3) would then not have been necessary because everything could have been contained in paragraph 6(2), which would have avoided any doubt. The wording of the schedule is unclear; it could be interpreted by an admission authority to mean that it did not have to follow the guidance absolutely.<br><br>
It would be helpful if the Minister could explain what the guidance is likely to include. We have expressed our worries about the level of consultation because parents whose children attend a school that proposes to change selection arrangements have a right to be consulted. Furthermore, we have made it clear that other schools may be affected by such proposals and we want to ensure that they are involved in the consultation arrangements.<br><br>
If the minister can give the committee an absolute assurance about the guidance, which will be recorded in <i>Hansard,</i> and say that the words "have regard to" mean that an admission authority must follow distinctly the guidance in all its forms, we might reconsider whether our amendments are necessary. However, at present we are worried that the schedule, as drafted, will not make it necessary in all the circumstances for an admission authority to follow absolutely the Secretary of State's guidance. Will the Minister explain the nature of the consultation process and tell us whether it must be followed or whether it will simply be a recommendation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether Opposition Members want me to repeat our earlier discussion about the nature of the consultation. I thought that I had made it very clear that the nature and extent of consultation are already well established, but that under the Bill, we shall want to consult interested parties before determining exactly how the consultation process will work. That caused great hilarity this morning. I was not sure why, but we shall want to consult those involved to try to get the consultative process right.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Attercliffe has difficulty with the words "have regard to". We do not want to make the position absolute because we want to strike a proper balance between flexibility and discretion. It is reasonable to allow schools to determine that, but we want to provide a proper framework for the consultative process in the schedule. As with so many matters in the education world, individuals or interested groups have recourse through sections of existing statute to the Secretary of State if they are dissatisfied with the way in which the school has used the processes, or ultimately recourse to the courts—a route that we should not want to encourage, but it is always available to individuals and interested parties.<br><br>
I resist the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that the schedule should be worded to make it an absolute requirement for the admission authority to follow the guidance. In some cases, that would be unnecessary or undesirable. It is fair to say that in most predictable, reasonable or commonplace circumstances, the consultation process will be required by schools. They will need to have regard to the guidance issued and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0185">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 157</span>
follow the well-established paths, although—who knows?—we may want to alter, improve or increase them. All the protections available under the existing regimes, therefore, will still be available under the process described in the schedule. The difficulties that the hon. Gentleman thought he had identified will not exist. In a number of different interlocking and interrelating ways, the protections that the hon. Gentleman seeks are already contained in the Bill, so I argue that the amendments are unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the Minister is saying. He seems to be arguing that the new procedures on consultation arrangements will be simpler than those that already exist, so that there will not be a problem. I am probably missing the Minister's point, but my understanding is that the proposals before us are a way of speeding up the process of changing selection arrangements in certain circumstances—they are a shorter version of existing requirements to go through formal procedures and publish proposals.<br><br>
It had occurred to Opposition Committee members that, as the Government are trying to find a fast track for admission authorities to secure changes in selection arrangements in certain schools, the proposed consultation arrangements might also be fast track and exclude organisations or individuals who otherwise might be consulted. That is the reassurance we seek from the Minister; will he say whether the consultation will involve all the parents in the school seeking a change in the selection arrangements? Will it involve other schools in the same local authority or admissions area that might also be affected by that change?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am now caught in a dilemma; I want to say a simple "Yes" in reply to the hon. Gentleman's questions, and I strongly suspect that I shall end up doing so. Having said this morning, however, that we intend to consult on the contents of the guidance that we shall issue, and having said that I imagine that the guidance will cover similar ground to that in existing established practice—I mentioned the appropriate circular this morning—I am somewhat reluctant to give a cast-iron guarantee at this stage on the contents of the guidance and the extent of the consultation that will be required. I think that I am on pretty safe ground in saying that I would be very surprised if consultation was not extended to the parents at the affected school, and I mentioned feeder schools this morning. I also note that amendment No. 57 refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"the governing bodies of all schools within the area of the local education authority within which the school to which the proposal applies is situated".</p></blockquote>
There is much common ground between us, so I do not see any difficulty; the amendments deal very much with the kind of territory that we shall cover.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me and allow me a tiny bit of latitude. The only question concerns whether we go further than the amendments suggest, not whether we shall exclude any of the areas mentioned. It is very much in the interest of the school that wants to make such changes to get this right and to ensure that they are carrying with them as many
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 158</span>
people and interested parties as possible. It would be an unwise school that sought to go ahead with such a change without consulting the material groups and individuals—the parents and the other schools in the catchment area with which the school has a relationship.<br><br>
I do not expect any difficulty, but I stop a little short of undertaking to ensure that the guidance will contain such and such, because in doing that I should pre-empt the consultation process that I have myself proposed, which would make me vulnerable to Opposition Members saying, "There you go again; you said you would consult, but you have already pre-determined the result."<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member for Attercliffe will forgive my hesitation and nervousness, but I think that I have said enough to give him a pretty clear idea of our intentions and the reassurance that he needs as the basis on which he can safely withdraw the amendments—the ground has already been covered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I understand what the Minister has said. I think that he has been saying that he does not want to prejudice the results of the consultations on the consultation arrangements. However, as part of the consultation on the consultation, he will suggest that the eventual consultation must include reference to feeder schools, other schools affected and the parents of the school in question. On the basis of that, and given the Minister's assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 55, line 23, afer "may", insert "having regard to the advice of the local education authority and to the impact on the number of surplus places.".<br><br>
The Minister has recently said that it is in the interests of schools to get matters right and that it would be an unwise school that did not take a certain action. However, is not the law sometimes intended to stop people doing things that are unwise and not in the best interests of the wider community?<br><br>
I recommend the amendment because it would place a duty on governing bodies of county schools at least to have regard to the advice of LEAs on the impact of having a number of surplus school places when they publish proposals to become wholly selective.<br><br>
The amendment is essential because LEAs are responsible for funding and strategic planning. They are there to give curriculum advice, look after buildings, oversee funds and be in touch with local needs.<br><br>
The Minister has just said that parents voting for proposals was the essence of good local democracy. Surely, if parents wanted their local schools to become grammar schools, they would pursue that with the local authority and make their views clearly known to local councillors. If they did so, surely LEAs could pass on that wisdom to the governing body during
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0186">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 159</span>
consultations. There is no requirement to consult LEAs about such matters, but it would be perverse not to consult LEAs in such circumstances.<br><br>
We have heard some interesting arguments today. About an hour ago, we heard the real truth—the essence of what the Bill is about. When my hon. Friend the Member for Barking said that the Bill is about Islington, the hon. Members for Dover and for Gravesham (Mr. Arnold) and others said "Yes". So the Bill is not about what is heppening in Kent or other parts of the country, but about what is happening in Islington.<br><br>
I can tell Conservative Members that people in my constituency would not even know where Islington is. In fact, I do not know where it is. I look forward to Conservative Members telling me where it is. Clearly, Islington is the centre of the Conservative world, which is why we hear so much about it. There is a danger in that because London Members and those with constituencies in the outer-London area are obsessed with London politics and education. Although that is important, there are many other places in Britain.<br><br>
I want to talk and hear about what is happening in other parts of the country. There are 500 schools in Devon alone. We have a large population who have probably never visited London in their lives, nor have they any ambition to do so. They had the ambition to send me to London to speak up for them, but they have no desire to come here themselves. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Barking will intervene and tell me where Islington is. I do not know, and neither do the good people of Devon.<br><br>
8.45 pm<br><br>
It was interesting to see the Minister, who is so often stretched out in his chair looking like the Cheshire cat that has found a body, suddenly become animated when he started talking about LEAs and local democracy. He said that some schools had been "scarred" by the LEAs, but I think he meant to say that he is scared of the LEAs, the democracy that comes with them and the views that they express. At some stage, we shall hear, as we have done before, why we should take no notice of LEAs or listen to small groups because no one turns out for local elections. Therefore, the many thousands of votes in local elections, including Islington, which is Labour—are as nothing. More important are the views of a few people on a governing body who may, or may not, represent what is happening locally.<br><br>
The real reason why our amendments have been rejected by the Government is their dislike of democracy. It is just like the opt-out ballots. The parents keep getting it wrong. Either they do not vote in the first place, or they vote no, which has happened in many areas in my constituency because people do not want to opt out.<br><br>
The Minister could perhaps overcome his paranoia about LEAs and accept that the governing body should at least have regard to—not be bound by—
<br><blockquote><p>"the advice of the local education authority"</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 160</span>
on the matter of surplus places, which the Minister often tells us is so important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman became a little carried away and lost me during part of his argument when he started talking about grammar schools. This part of the Bill refers to specialist schools and we should stick to that subject when considering the amendment.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's concern is somewhat misplaced not only because of the consultation process that we have already discussed thoroughly but because of the provisions covering the possibility of school places in a particular area being somewhat tight. If an increase in selection means that some pupils are unable to find places at a local school, clause 12 can be invoked as it provides a safety net for those circumstances. Beyond that, as the hon. Gentleman knows, there are well-established further safety nets that are now enshrined in the Education Act 1996—the consolidation legislation—in which either the Funding Agency for Schools or the LEA can direct a school to take pupils, if appropriate, or in more extreme or unusual circumstances, can provide new places altogether.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman may not be entirely happy with the thought of the Funding Agency for Schools, rather than the LEA, providing places, but let us concentrate on the point that is bothering the hon. Gentleman. I am confident that the problem will be covered by the combination of clause 12 and the overriding provisions that already exist in statute, and that that will continue, if there is a possible threat to the provision of places in a locality as a result of the more permissive regime in the Bill. There are more than ample mechanisms in place—under clause 12 and through existing statutes—to protect the provision of places. The amendment is unnecessary; I ask the Committee to reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not persuaded by the Minister's remarks. It is absolutely essential that note be taken of the local education authority's views on such a change of nature of a school, which is a matter of such importance to a locality. I shall press the matter to a Division.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Ms. Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that we are about to have the pleasure of a response from the Under-Secretary of State.<br><br>
Amendment No. 18 has nothing to do with Barking, the constituency that I am proud to represent. Barking has comprehensive schools throughout; it does not have an opted-out school. It has performed rather poorly in many examinations in the past year but has established a large number of important initiatives, including the Gatsby project on the teaching of mathematics, in which schools working with the local authority are making a determined effort to raise standards. No doubt all members of the Committee will join me in congratulating Barking council on its efforts and on the beginnings of an improvement in results. It is demonstrating our consistent opinion that comprehensive schools working together in a family with the local education authority's support, and with a focus on raising standards and effectiveness, can achieve results. However, it still has some way to go.<br><br>
The amendment is not about Islington either. However, it should interest some Conservative members of the Committee in whose constituency there are grammar schools. Its purpose is to test the consistency of the Government's approach to the Bill.<br><br>
The Government have said throughout that they do not especially favour selective education or want more selective schools; they want permissive legislation—those words have been used by the Minister several times—to facilitate parental choice. If that is so, and the Government want to be consistent, they must ensure that permissive legislation applies to all schools, not just to those that are currently comprehensive.<br><br>
The amendments would ensure that consistency of approach. There are grammar schools in the constituencies of the hon. Members for Hendon, South and for Sutton and Cheam (Lady Olga Maitland). I am sure that they, and other Conservative
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 162</span>
Members, want their constituents to have the same choice, and for the same permissive legislation to apply in every school in their constituency as it would apply in our constituencies were this politically motivated Bill to become law. An attempt to achieve consistency underlies these amendments, which would allow those schools that are currently selective to become comprehensive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But they do not want to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is very good at passing remarks from a sedentary position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply to the hon. Member for Dover and then I will give way. The hon. Gentleman, who cannot resist the temptation to intervene—too often from a sedentary position—says that they do not want to. If he is so convinced that that is the case, he will support me in ensuring that the legislation is in place to give those schools and communities the choice to reaffirm, if necessary, their desire to maintain a selective school. All it would require is for the selective school to reconsider whether it wanted to remain selective. It would be subject to the same consideration as comprehensive schools in that respect. No one would deny selective schools that choice; the amendments would determine that they have it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for giving way. The grammar school in my constituency, to which she refers, has more than 800 applicants every year for 90 places. Can she tell me of any comprehensive school that is so over-subscribed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I am absolutely honest, I cannot, off the top of my head. However, if the hon. Gentleman were to give me notice of the question, I would find out the answer. If the school in the hon. Gentleman's constituency is indeed so popular and valued, he should have nothing to fear from the amendment, which would simply ensure that current grammar schools undertake the same review of their selective arrangements as the Goverment want comprehensive schools to do.<br><br>
Two sets of amendments have been selected, the first of which relates to local authority schools, the second to grant-maintained schools; again, that is for consistency. The Bill's emphasis, set out in clause 2, is to encourage schools to increase their selective intake. The amendments are designed simply to present schools with the options, if they want them, of reducing the proportion of children whom they select by ability or of ending the process of selecting pupils and becoming comprehensive. I stress that we want simply to put that choice to people. If the Government and Conservative Members really believe in parental choice and that this is a bit of permissive legislation, I cannot understood why they cannot let permissiveness hold across all parents, all schools and all constituencies. The amendments take a common sense approach, support for which is necessary if hon. Members are to be consistent.<br><br>

9 pm<br><br>
The Bill, of course, presumes that schools want only to become more selective. I do not understand why that presumption exists. There seems to be no evidence that schools want to be more selective. We have repeatedly drawn evidence to the Committee's and Ministers' attention showing that most schools do not want to be more selective. I understand that only one in 100—it may be one in 1,000; I am not sure whether I have put enough noughts on the end—of those who responded to the Goverment's White Paper showed any interest in the concept of selection. Only 1 per cent. of respondents want it; so the Government have put forward a Bill built on the presumption that schools want to be more selective.<br><br>
The Minister has said that the Opposition do not know what the Conservative Education Association is. Okay, we will not talk about that association now, although its evidence appears whole-heartedly to condemn the Government's proposals. We shall not talk, either, about the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, for whom I feel sorry. During her period of office, she has been lumbered with all sorts of bits of legislation for which I believe that she has shown no personal support, such as the idea of grammar schools in every town or the introduction of nursery vouchers. When she retires from office during the next six months and reflects on what she has achieved, she will feel sadness and regret that she had to push through Bills for which she felt no personal commitment.<br><br>
Let us leave the Secretary of State aside and consider two Conservative education authorities whose views we know. Bromley has said consistently that increased selection would damage choice. Westminster—the flagship Conservative council, so often held up to us as a council whose performance we should admire—clearly said that increased selection would limit choice.<br><br>
If all local education authorities, all schools and all those who responded to the White Paper have demonstrated a propensity towards comprehensive education rather than secondary modern and grammar schools, it must surely be proper and fair to allow public opinion to hold sway and let all those groups have the facility to consider once a year whether they wish to retain selection in the admissions procedure.<br><br>
I shall say just one more thing, because I can see how restless Conservative Members are becoming. Do we need this provision? The first education measure with which I was involved was the Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained Schools Act 1996. During the proceedings on that Bill, we were told that the introduction of nursery vouchers would lead to greater diversity and encourage the growth of nursery places in the private and voluntary sector.<br><br>
We are only half way through the pilot stage for nursery vouchers in four authorities, but my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport and as members of the Select Committee on Education and Employment, recently visited Norfolk to take evidence
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 164</span>
on the experience of Norfolk county council since the introduction of the vouchers. What was so fascinating about that evidence was that with one voice—a particularly strong voice from the private and voluntary sector—everybody agreed that the introduction of nursery vouchers had threatened and killed off many private and voluntary places. Therefore, the scheme has diminished choice.<br><br>
The practice of the Act did not meet the Government's intentions. The Government should learn the lesson of that legislation. So much is decided in haste and repented at leisure. If the Government do not allow every parent in every school to think annually about selection and admission proceedings and if the provision is limited to comprehensive schools—and secondary moderns in areas where there are already grammar schools—they will go up the same route that they followed with nursery vouchers. They will enact something that does not meet their objectives. The same could be said fo the legislation on grant-maintained schools, which also has not been a success by any standard for the Government.<br><br>
We simply ask that the Government treat all schools fairly and give all parents—whether they live in Hendon, Sutton and Cheam or Amersham—exactly the same choice as they wish to give some parents. If the Government wish to be consistent and to demonstrate they are concerned for all parents, and not just a few, they will accept the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is my intention to allow the debate on this group of amendments to proceed until 9.15 pm. If the group is not disposed of by that point, I shall suspend the Committee until 10.30 pm.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mrs. Cheryl Gillan)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best not to detain the Committee at this late hour.<br><br>
The amendments would require all schools, including wholly selective schools, to consider not only whether to introduce or extend selection, but to consider whether to decrease or end selection. It is clear that parents throughout the country want local schools to consider introducing or extending selection. We agree with them. The clause will ensure that governing bodies do that on a regular basis and tell parents what they have decided and why.<br><br>
Selection is an important matter, which deserves proper consideration as part of a school's strategy for improving standards and responding to parental wishes. The clause does not place any requirement on schools to introduce or extend selection; it only requires governing bodies to consider the matter.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Barking will be quite pleased to know that there is nothing to prevent a school from considering whether to seek to reduce or end its selective arrangements, but we do not require it do so. A decision to reduce the number of selective places may require the publication of statutory proposals if the reduction would mean that the school has crossed the thresholds in schedule 1 or clause 4 or, in certain
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0189">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 165</span>
circumstances, if the reduction in the number of selective places were to change the character of the school significantly.<br><br>
Obviously, there is an exemption for wholly selective schools. It is not necessary for them to consider whether to increase or introduce selection. All places are already filled by pupils of high ability or aptitude.<br><br>
Removing the word "high", as amendment No. 47 suggests, would mean that a small number of schools that use selective tests to place pupils in ability bands would also be exempt from the annual review. There is no reason for schools that band pupils in order to preserve their comprehensive nature to be exempt from considering whether taking a higher proportion of able pupils would be welcomed by local parents. I urge the Committee to reject amendment No. 47.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rather surprised by the Minister's reply. The amendments are reasonable. The Government constantly claim that they are committed to consultation, to ensuring that all parents have a choice, to diversity, to a dynamic education system in which there is continual change and schools can alter their character. If the Government's commitment to those principles is genuine, they must accept the amendment.<br><br>
The assertion that grammar schools will raise standards is not generally believed. If the Bill was enacted, and even five schools chose to become grammar schools, but subsequently found that changing their admissions procedure had led to a lowering of standards in a specific area, local people should have an opportunity to reconsider whether they wished to retain grammar and comprehensive schools in their community. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I have been given a message.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend agree that, given the Minister's statement this morning that he was happy for people to move from selective to comprehensive schools, it is sensible and logical to<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 166</span>
place an obligation on schools to consider that proposal? They could then choose whether to implement this permissive measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Yardley. The amendment should be supported in that spirit. If it is not accepted, the rejection will confirm suspicions that we have often expressed, that the Bill has nothing to do with quality of education, raising standards or even choice. The measure is about narrow, party political interests, mixed with a little bigotry. As the Secretary of State said in the Select Committee on Education and Employment, the Bill will not see the light of day because it will not be enacted before a general election. After that, we shall focus on raising standards, not on structure.</span></p>
