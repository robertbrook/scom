I warmly welcome you to the Chair, to preside over this morning's proceedings, Mrs. Dunwoody. I do not think that the task will be arduous, either in the time it will take or in the need to deal with dissension in the ranks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main provision of the Bill, which has, I believe, been accepted by both sides of the Committee, is in the new clause 1, and therefore it will be for the convenience of the Committee to accept the proposed order of consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>New Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>POWER OF CERTAIN LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO TAKE STEPS TO MINIMIZE GENERATION OF HOUSEHOLD, COMMERCIAL OR INDUSTRIAL WASTE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>'After section 63 of the Environmental, Protection Act 1990 there is inserted—</p>
	<p>	<i>"Power of waste collection authority or waste disposal authority in relation to generation of controlled waste</i></p>
	<p>63A.—(1) A relevant authority may do, or arrange of the doing of, or contribute towards the expenses of the doing of, anything which in its opinion is necessary or expedient for the purpose of minimizing the quantities of controlled waste, or controlled waste of any description, generated in its area.
	<ol>
	<li>Where a relevant authority in England ("the first authority") proposes to exercise any of its powers under subsection (1), it shall before doing so consult about the proposal every other relevant authority whose area includes all of part of the area of the first authority.</li>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. James Clappison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
I join my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Waller) in welcoming you to the Chair this morning, Mrs. Dunwoody. It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. There was no Second Reading debate for the Bill, so I take this opportunity to congratulate my hon. Friend on bringing the matter forward. The Government agree with the principle behind the Bill, which would permit local authorities, should they choose to do so, to investigate and promote methods of minimising waste generated in their areas, and to take follow-up action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 1 and the amendments that I shall move subsequently are technical measures, designed solely to help achieve the Bill's purpose. We agree with the Bill's sponsors that clarification of local authority powers on waste prevention is necessary. We simply want to establish the Bill correctly in the context of existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the advice of parliamentary counsel, it is proposed that the Bill's provisions should, by means of new clause 1, be inserted into the Environmental Protection Act 1990, as a new section 63A. It is better for the new provision to appear in the existing Act as an integral part of United Kingdom waste legislation. The new section 63A(1) of the 1990 Act will give relevant authorities—meaning waste collection disposal authorities—powers to act to minimise the generation of controlled waste. It will be up to the authority to decide whether to exercise the power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New section 63A(2) of the 1990 Act will require an authority that decides to take action under the section to consult those other authorities that are responsible for the same, or part of the same, geographical area, to avoid setting up measures that run contrary to each other. Subsection (3) sets out the definition of the relevant authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 1 is intended to replace clauses 1 to 3 of the Bill, and therefore I shall oppose those clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall follow the precedent set by my hon. Friend the Minister, and say a little about the Bill in general terms, since, as he pointed out, there was no Second Reading debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that practical examples of the benefits that the Bill may bring are more useful in showing its value than any theoretical justification. I am therefore delighted to be able to state facts. In my constituency, the Keighley Business Forum is in the vanguard of organisations that are joining the public and the private sectors to develop a strategy against waste in all its forms. The Bill would assist all parties to work together with a common purpose. In its waste minimisation and management programme, submitted to the Yorkshire and Humberside regional office last month as a local challenge proposal, Keighley Business Forum stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Business has begun to realise that sound environmental performance is not peripheral, is not an optional extra; it is key to staying in business."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0642">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
In this matter co-operation between local authorities and local industry is essential. Local authorities are expected to deal with waste and recycling is one of the more acceptable options for doing so. However, they have no power to take action or to co-operate with other bodies to prevent the waste being produced in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is unfortunate, because waste elimination, reduction and re-use are identified by the Government in their White Paper "Making Waste Work" as the most valuable objectives in the waste hierarchy, ahead of recovery and disposal. As Friends of the Earth, to which I pay tribute, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Rather than throwing precious resources into the bin, we should be trying to conserve them."</p></blockquote>
Keighley Business Forum succeeded last year in winning a skills challenge bid for its initial project involving 23 companies. It plans to work with 200 small and medium-sized enterprises to encourage a strategy of waste prevention. It believes that by incorporating sustainability into the economic development of the district, a platform can be created to attract badly needed new investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It goes without saying that local authorities have a vital role to play, and the Bill would enable a partnership approach to be adopted in co-operation with such councils, including Bradford metropolitan council, because a common position is needed to build sustainable local economies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is it so important? In my constituency, the only means of disposing of local waste at present is by landfill. At the rate of present usage of void space and with the lack of proposed new sites, the available space will be exhausted within three or four years. Any additional transportation will mean a cost increase to business, making Keighley a less attractive location for investment. Alternatives to landfill, therefore, must be developed fast and prevention is better than trying to deal with waste after it has been generated. Nationally, we produce enough waste to fill Lake Windermere every nine months, a fact that is vividly shown in the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue concerns not only business but individuals. I am grateful to Sarah Miller and Ann Link of the Women's Environmental Network, which encouraged me to introduce the Bill, and suggested some practical ways in which local authorities can promote waste saving: for example, by publicising cheap repair schemes for household items such as vacuum cleaners and washing machines, which may otherwise be disposed of if they go wrong; by persuading local restaurants to cut down on the unnecessary waste of food; by discouraging businesses from producing unnecessary publications and paper and by finding ways to reduce product packaging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, another project in my constituency is the Russell street project. It is an innovative training organisation focusing on skill shortages and was
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
created through the inspiration of a local man, Mr. Dick Taylor. The plan is to develop strategies with local firms to handle packaging waste and to refurbish furniture and equipment which would otherwise simply be thrown away. A vast amount is thrown away from offices and people's homes although it is capable of being re-used if a little work is put in to add value to it. The Bill will help organisations such as the Russell street project, which has close links with Calderdale and Kirklees councils in west Yorkshire. Those councils are following a waste minimisation strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome the work done on the Bill by Mr. Ron Bailey and the other officials. There has been a great spirit of co-operation among the Minister, his officials, myself and those who have advised me and between the Government and Opposition. That must be right. The Bill is a valuable means of ensuring that we shall have a collaborative strategy towards minimising the waste produced by our throw-away society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Joan Ruddock 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, Deptford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join in welcoming you, Mrs. Dunwoody. It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to support the Minister's amendments to the Bill. I remind the Committee that the Bill was originally presented to Parliament by my hon. Friend the Member for Glanford and Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley), and I was a sponsor of that Bill. Therefore, I support wholeheartedly the hon. Member for Keighley and I congratulate him on his success in getting the Bill this far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received many strategies from the European Union that have been transposed into United Kingdom legislation, but deficiencies still exist in the strategy for waste prevention and minimisation. We have strategies for recycling, incineration, heat recovery and a whole raft of policies that are incredibly important. However, the Opposition strongly believe that there is a need to reduce waste at source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recently considered producer responsibility regulations are also deficient. The Government chose to consult with industry and set aside the interests of local authorities. That was regrettable, and we hope that the approach will be changed in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill goes to the heart of where many responsibilities lie, which is with local authorities. In this country, 70 per cent. of controlled waste and 90 per cent. of household waste goes to landfill. As the hon. Member for Keighley pointed out, that is an incredible volume of waste. He provided a good example of what that implies. We can all envisage the enormous quantity of waste that would be needed to fill Lake Windermere once, let alone several times. For that reason we support waste reduction at source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join in congratulating the Women's Environmental Network. As the hon. Member for Keighley pointed out, the network has brought forward proposals that the House can accept, and it has provided many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0643">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
positive examples of what can be done. We must explain to people why it is important to reduce waste, and how each of us can make a contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's amendments will provide a framework through which the Bill can be put into effect. I do not need to take any more of the Committee's time, so I will reiterate our support for the Bill. In the short time remaining for this Parliament, I hope that we shall ensure that the Bill becomes law so that ocal authorities are given new powers to help us all reduce the production of waste.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Austin-Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Woolwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to add my support to everything that has been said. As a former leader of a local council and a former chair of an environment committee, I am only too aware of the problems that face local authorities in straying into areas that may be regarded as ultra vires. I was involved many years ago with a project for the greening of local government, when it was questioned whether it was legal for the local authority to pursue certain promotional measures on waste prevention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend all the examples that have been mentioned—especially the encouragement by local authorities for the repair and re-use of electrical and household appliances, which would not only reduce waste but provide employment and training opportunities, especially for young people. A number of other benefits will also come from steps to prevent waste.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I add my tribute to the Women's Environmental Network, Friends of the Earth and the other bodies that have been mentioned. The hon. Member for Keighley said that landfill was probably the only available option for waste disposal. We are not here to discuss matters of waste disposal, but hon. Members will know that there has been a move towards incineration. This is not the place to discuss the pros and cons of methods of waste disposal, but there is an issue relating to waste prevention and the role of local authorities. With the effective privatisation of waste disposal and the move towards incineration, it is possible that local authorities could become locked into contracts that guarantee a particular tonnage and calorific value of waste. That could be seen as encouraging waste production rather than reducing and preventing it. The Bill is useful in drawing the attention of local authorities to the possible conflicts in some of the approaches that they are adopting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to add my support to the Bill. It is vital to introduce measures that will reduce the amount of waste, instead of trying to solve what we shall do with the waste when it is produced. The hon. Member for Woolwich (Mr. Austin-Walker) said that waste need not only be
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
disposed of only by landfill, and I agree with him. Incineration is a growth industry. In my constituency, Castle Cement is looking to use the incineration of waste products as a form of energy. It is also considering ways of using its cement kilns to destroy waste, and I am totally opposed to that. If the Bill will reduce sensibly the total amount of waste that is being produced—I do not mean by more regulations and heaping massive costs on to industry and consumers—it will have the endorsement of not only consumers but industry. It adds massive costs to produce the packaging on some of the goods that we buy these days. An example of that is the packaging on software, which is very bulky, but which contains perhaps only a disk and a small booklet. A more sensible approach by industry to packaging some goods would lead to a massive reduction in the amount of waste that is produced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Robert Spink 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Castle Point)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add my congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley on introducing this small but important measure. The reduction of controlled waste is most important for my constituents because they suffer doubly from the generation of controlled waste. It will have not only an economic and environmental impact on everyone, but an impact on the quality of life of my constituents. We suffer from poor air quality because we are surrounded by landfill waste disposal sites. Any measure that will reduce the amount of waste at those sites will be greatly welcomed by my constituents, so I have no hesitation in paying great tribute to my hon. Friend for promoting the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
