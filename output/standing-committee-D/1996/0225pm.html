</ul></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments is concerned mainly with the distribution of general practitioners and the role of the Medical Practices Committee in that. However, it also includes amendment No. 107, which Labour Members call the whistleblowing amendment.<br><br>
The Government have conceded that the Medical Practices Committee should be given a role in the approval of pilot schemes, but amendment No. 111 does not go as far as either the Medical Practices Committee or the Opposition would like. The Government amendment would require the Secretary of State to consult the Medical Practices Committee if it appeared to him that the pilot proposals would have an effect on the number of GPs in the area, but would not require him to take account of those representations. Amendment No. 43, which has the support of the Medical Practices Committee, would require the Secretary of State to
<br><blockquote><p>"have regard to any representations made to him by them".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 60 would require all agreements to be submitted by the health authority to the MPC
<br><blockquote><p>"as if they were applications to provide general medical services".</p></blockquote>
The debate about the role of the Medical Practices Committee, in relation to part I of the Bill, flows naturally from this morning's long debate about the importance of evaluation. Conservative Members did not use their voting strength to uphold our argument, but we are sure that in their hearts and minds they were persuaded by it. We want sufficient strategic capacity, under the Bill, to ensure proper distribution of general practitioners. No disadvantage should arise out of whether a general practitioner's patients are in pilot or non-pilot areas. The strategic role of the Medical Practices Committee is well established and developed, and we want to ensure consistency in the quality control offered by the MPC under parts I and II of the Bill. Otherwise, no adequate quality checks will be possible on general practitioners' practice.<br><br>
It is worth reflecting on the effectiveness of the Medical Practices Committee. Since its creation in 1948, by virtue of its verification of doctors' capabilities and the legitimacy of their qualifications, there has been only one bogus general practitioner. Other doctors, such as hospital consultants, do not undergo the double checking of which the Medical Practices Committee provides the second tier, and we read, not often but more often than we should like, of bogus doctors being appointed as locums or to other positions in hospitals. This morning, we clearly identified the considerable deregulation that the Bill proposes. We want to ensure that that deregulation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0530">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
does not extend to evaluating a doctor's ability to practise, or to the distribution of doctors, in a way that could jeopardise patients' safety.<br><br>
Later in our proceedings, we will consider other aspects of the Medical Practices Committee's responsibilities for general medical services that the Bill amends. The Medical Practices Committee is worried that no progress has been made on the question of who places GPs on the medical list.<br><br>
The Minister believes that health authorities, as responsible public bodies, can be expected to do that properly, but we fear that not all health authorities have the ability to do that. They do not make other medical appointments. NHS trusts appoint hospital doctors. Some health authorities have already suggested that if such a function were delegated to them, they would ask the MPC to act as their agent. In the light of such recognition by some forward-looking health authorities, why not enshrine the responsibility for placing GPs on the medical list in the Bill?<br><br>
The MPC is not satisfied that health authorities will act in accordance with the Bill's intention to allow on the medical lists only those GPs whose prospective partners have received approval in principle. Without sanctions, the system will be open to abuse. For example, if the MPC does not approve in principle a request that is supported by a health authority for an additional partner, there is little to prevent the health authority from ignoring the MPC's ruling and granting the application.<br><br>
The MPC is worried that that will happen sooner rather than later and that the proposed safeguards will be insufficient. Clearly, no one wants such an outcome. Therefore, we shall press our amendments to safeguard the Bill's requirements.<br><br>
Government amendment No. 111 deals with central work force planning. The British Medical Association and the MPC share anxieties about it. The Bill creates two different work force planning systems. Under one system, health authorities—boards in Scotland—make decisions through the Secretary of State about doctors who join pilot schemes. Under the other system, the MPC, or its Scottish equivalent, has a remit for determining GP recruitment or replacement under the current GP contract.<br><br>
It is clear that central work force planning is essential for the continuing nationwide delivery of high-quality care. That is linked to the importance of strategic oversight by the MPC. The British Medical Association believes that one overall body should be established to examine work force planning and distribution between health authorities and that that responsibility should not rest solely with the Secretary of State.<br><br>
In response to the British Medical Association's concerns, not least on checking admissions to the medical list, there have been extensive discussions involving the GMC, the MPC and the Department of Health about maintenance of a national overview of the medical work force and its distribution. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
Department's stated intention is to establish a national group to bring together the MPC and the resource allocation group to examine work force distribution between health authorities. That group is intended to advise the Secretary of State and the MPC on the boundaries that govern decisions on private schemes and on the appointment of part II GPs.<br><br>
The national group, the MPC and the Secretary of State would all be informed by local work force plans developed by the health authority in conjunction with local medical committees. The MPC and the national group could each raise concerns about those plans with the Secretary of State where necessary. The national group would be charged with maintaining a national overview of the medical work force and its distribution as well as resources issues.<br><br>
The new national group can, in the Department's, view, be non-statutory, but the statutory MPC would be expected to act within set parameters. That gives further cause for concern. We are convinced that emasculation of the Medical Practices Committee is intended. In the absence of any proven effective means of safeguarding the quality and safety of general practice in the tricky business of innovation and piloting into new waters, we believe that there may be a danger to quality of treatment and potentially to the safety of patients.<br><br>
The Government's slightly moderated but not yet satisfactory provisions on the Medical Practices Committee move from the position taken earlier in the draft primary care instructions. Under the heading
<br><blockquote><p>"Manpower Issues: the medical list and the MPC"</p></blockquote>
those instructions state:
<br><blockquote><p>"The MPC should have no power of veto over proposed pilots or long term part I arrangements."</p></blockquote>
At paragraph 12.2, they go on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where a pilot has been approved in an area, the MPC will carry out their manpower planning role for the residual GMS provision. In doing so they should take account of the supply of GMS provided by the pilot and operate as normal on the remaining GMS requirement. We could do this by way of placing an expectation"—</p></blockquote>
a gentle responsibility—
<br><blockquote><p>"upon them rather than through legislation."</p></blockquote>
Turning to the MPC, which is important in the context of the amendments, the drafting instructions add, at paragraph 12.5:
<br><blockquote><p>"We do not intend the Bill to have powers enabling the Secretary of State to abolish the MPC"—</p></blockquote>
we are all relieved about that—
<br><blockquote><p>"merely to modify its role in the new context of service delivery."</p></blockquote>
On vocational training checks, the instructions say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Only where the contract was with an individual GP would the authority be required to confirm that the doctor was vocationally trained or otherwise qualified under the EC directive. In all other cases the obligation would rest with the practice/Trust and would be a contractual matter and should be covered by any directions or regulations issued on contracts."</p></blockquote>
The background is important because it makes clear the scale of deregulation that this technical clause represents. We shall listen to the Minister, but we are enormously disturbed by the fact that the intention to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0531">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 123</span>
deregulate is greater than would appear from the drafting of the Bill.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
Our amendment on whistleblowing should be included in the Bill. It is essential that no doctor should find that they are less able to protect the interests of patients because of any new employment arrangements envisaged by the Bill. Doctors should be able to speak out if the conditions in which their patients are treated or are being cared for give cause for concern.<br><br>
Doctors do not blow the whistle lightly. Almost inevitably, it involves revealing confidential information about a patient, a group of patients or the conduct of colleagues. In almost every case, the action is taken only after the most careful consideration.<br><br>
Doctors' freedom to blow the whistle represents an affirmation of the traditional basis of medical practice that puts doctors' first loyalty to their patients and recognises their wider societal obligations as secondary to that. It also recognises that doctors must be free to exercise clinical judgment in respect of individual patients.<br><br>
In its 1993 publication "Medical Ethics Today", the BMA observed that there can be no free or informed debate on health matters if those with an expert contribution to make are excluded from the right to contribute. That is also recognised in paragraph 330 of the Whitley council's terms and conditions of service for hospital, medical and dental staff, which stresses:
<br><blockquote><p>"A practitioner shall be free, without prior consent of the employing authority, to publish books, articles etc. and to deliver any lecture or speech, whether on matters arising out of his or her hospital service or not."</p></blockquote>
If general practitioners are not employed on those terms—we know that the trusts' contracts of employment vary considerably—that freedom is compromised.<br><br>
As early as the early 1990s, whistleblowing became an issue for all health workers. It was brought to the fore by the sacking for gross misconduct of nurse Graham Pink who publicly voiced concerns about the welfare of acutely ill geriatric patients in a ward that he considered to be dangerously understaffed. In 1990, Mr. Pink was charged with a breach of confidentiality when he informed the media of the situation after the health authority said that it could not improve staffing levels.<br><br>
The case raised anxieties for all health professionals, particularly as it coincided with the so-called gagging clauses introduced into the employment contracts of trust hospitals. That has important implications for the way health professionals support or isolate colleagues for whistleblowing.<br><br>
The BMA considers it an ethical duty for doctors to take action against unsafe standards of care. It follows that doctors should also support, and not discriminate against, those who are brave enough to speak out about standards which are unacceptable. Although
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
paragraph 330 of the Whitley terms and conditions of service remains in force for staff on existing contracts, the freedom of NHS trusts to negotiate contracts for new staff has in some cases led to an attempt by trusts to impose new types of clauses within contracts.<br><br>
An example of those confidentiality clauses, the so-called gagging clauses, is as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"in the course of your work you may have access to confidential information which should not be disclosed to any other person unless in the pursuit of your duties or with the specific permission of the employing authority."</p></blockquote>
It is patently ridiculous for a doctor or any other member of staff who wants to raise concerns about the treatment of patients in the hospital to have to seek the permission of the employing authority before doing so. We want to ensure that doctors still have that freedom to speak out as a result of the Bill.<br><br>
It is also worth recording that the General Medical Council has now further clarified its attitude, making it clear that the first duty of the doctor is to the care of his patient. It adds that a doctor has a wider duty "to protect all patients". That duty to protect all patients is defined by the GMC as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"You must protect patients when you believe that a colleague's conduct, performance or health is a threat to them.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Before taking action you should do your best to find out the facts. Then, if necessary, you must tell someone from the employing authority or from a regulatory body. Your comments about colleagues must be honest. If you are not sure what to do, ask an experienced colleague. The safety of patients must come first at all times."</p></blockquote>
There is a clear consensus in the medical profession about the importance of doctors' freedom to speak out. We could spend considerably more time addressing the kind of organisational issues that would obviate the need for this course of last resort. But I am sure that we will return to that on many future occasions.<br><br>
The amendments can be seen as protecting the interests of patients in two ways. First, they ensure that the Medical Practices Committee continues to have proper oversight of pilots. Secondly, they ensure that the powers that GPs currently have as independent contractors to speak out on behalf of their patients are not removed from them should they become employed by NHS trusts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Thurnham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bolton, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I welcome you, Mr. Anderson, and assure you that I wish to speak only briefly to amendment (a) which is in this group and stands in my name. It calls for the Secretary of State to report annually to Parliament on the distribution of general practitioners in the regions of England, Scotland and Wales.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment is to draw attention to the need to study regional variations. I very much support the aims of the Bill and the way in which it recognises the important and innovatory role of GPs and others in providing primary care. We got a shock a few years ago in my constituency when the chairman of the family practitioners committee was sent to prison for six months for prescription fraud. We are very proud of our medical services in Bolton and I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important Bill.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0532">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 125</span>
The Secretary of State said on Second Reading that primary care in inner city areas does not match the standards in the rest of the country. I want to draw attention to the figures in my constituency and in the north-west region.<br><br>
The Black report pointed out, in 1980, the large differences between the regions. I am sad to say that many of the anomalies and differences to which that report drew attention are still with us. I want briefly to mention three examples: children's services, renal services and dental health.<br><br>
I start with children's services and the perinatal mortality rates, which have been high in Bolton for many years. I recently tabled a parliamentary question on statistics to the Secretary of State for Health and was surprised to find that the question was referred to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is now responsible for reporting on health statistics. My reply, from the director of the Office for National Statistics, which comes under the Treasury, showed that the number of still births and deaths within the first week per 1,000 live births in Bolton was 40 per cent. above the national average, according to the figures for the past five years.<br><br>
The national average has deteriorated, which is against the overall encouraging trends in "The Health of the Nation". Sadly, in Bolton there has been no improvement in the five-year period covered by the figures. That shows the differences in the regions and the difficulties faced in inner-city areas. I call on the Government, when they consider approving pilot schemes, to pay attention to the regional differences and to go further than merely approving them, by encouraging the introduction of schemes that tackle the difficulties in each of the regions.<br><br>
There is great public concern in Bolton about the services in nearby specialist children's hospitals at Pendlebury and Booth Hall. Both hospitals are the subject of closure proposals and I hope that a decision will be taken quickly to provide services, preferably at Hope hospital. It is important to know how well primary care services are adapting to the changes as they take on more and more of what used to be done in the hospitals.<br><br>
I was shocked recently to find that the north-west is the only region that does not provide a full range of renal services, especially the new disconnect system, which provides a much better service for people who require peritoneal dialysis, giving a better quality of life and mobility. One of my constituents, who works for the emergency services, said that he might be invalided out of the services if he does not have the disconnect system. He asked why it was not available in the north-west. A national health service should deal with such differences. I understand that it is a matter of cost, but economies could be made if the Government took decisions about the provision of renal services in the north-west.<br><br>
The proposals rationalise services with two hubs and spokes. We want services in the Manchester
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>
Royal infirmary and at Hope hospital to provide a good service to local people in Bolton and other parts of north Manchester. The director of renal medicine at the Salford Royal Hospitals NHS trust wrote to me stating the benefits that would occur. He said that at present
<br><blockquote><p>"only half the patients who could benefit from life saving dialysis therapy are on treatment."</p></blockquote>
He feels that the development of in-patient centres at Hope hospital and the Manchester Royal infirmary could address that problem by providing much better access for patients. Bolton residents would benefit significantly from the proposed changes. There would be twice-weekly renal clinics, dialysis within the district and a specialist renal physician working closely, often daily, with the clinicians and other healthcare professionals in the community and the hospitals. The consultation paper stresses the importance that the spoke functions would provide in facilitating links with primary care.<br><br>
Following my recent questions, the Minister will be aware of my concern about dental health, in particular children's dental health. After my recent questions, the Minister is aware of my concern. The paper "An Oral Health Strategy for England" contains a map from which it is clear that the north-west region is the worst for dental health. Tables published by the British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry sadly show Bolton at the bottom of the national league table, along with north and central Manchester. It is significant that the bottom 12 areas, all in the north-west, suffer from low natural fluoride in the water. In the top 12 regions of the country, the water is mostly fluoridated or has good amounts of fluoride in it. The table also has a Jarman index—a socio-economic index that shows clearly that fluoride is the principal factor in determining children's dental health.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
The North West regional health authority is unhappy that it fares so badly. It produced a brief for me which, sadly, shows that the trends are adverse. In Bolton, the percentage of children who are free of dental caries has deteriorated to 26 per cent. in the latest, 1993–94, figures, from 41 per cent. in 1987–88. It is clear that it is not merely a minority ethnic problem, but that it affects the population in general. Good primary care services are required.<br><br>
The Government set a target for the country. They want 70 per cent. of five-year-old children to be free of dental caries by 2003, but I shall be amazed if Bolton achieves that objective without considerable changes. The same story emerges in respect of the number of decayed, missing or filled teeth among five-year-olds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the amendments relate to GPs, not to dental services. I have been fairly relaxed so far, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will end his remarks shortly.</span></p>

and the fact that the health of children's teeth may have implications far beyond their visists to their dentist. Children suffering from a heart defect may die if they have a problem with their teeth; dental infection can affect the heart. In many ways, the health of teeth is indicative of the population's health. I am using those extreme examples to illustrate the importance that I attach to the Minister considering these schemes, when he is asked to approve them, in view of the extent to which they tackle the severe regional differences that affect the targets set out in "The Health of the Nation". All of us support the targets. We congratulate the Government on aspects on which they have had some success, but if success is being achieved nationally despite significant regional variations, I urge the Government to tackle the problem.<br><br>
Figures for toothpaste consumption are indicative of people's approach to general health. Television figures show that, in Granadaland, toothpaste consumption is only half of that in southern England. The Government must deal with those regional differences to bring about greater conformity in dental health.<br><br>
The Minister may remember that both of us were elected to the House on the same day in June 1983. I doubt he enjoyed the satisfaction that I felt that my 5,000th day as a Member of Parliament was on Valentine's day. When my supporters asked me how I might best celebrate, I decided that the best thing that I could do was get 5,000 toothbrushes to distribute to the five-year-olds of Bolton. I am pleased to say that the North West regional health authority supported the initiative, with sponsorship from North West Water, which was also concerned about the dental health of children and adults in the north-west. Goldsborough Healthcare which provides primary health care in my constituency, SmithKline Beecham, and <i>Bolton Evening News,</i> well supported by Bolton Wanderers—the captain came and spoke to the children on what it felt like to be top of the league table rather than bottom—all supported the initiative. I hope that that initiative will go some way towards highlighting the need to redress regional differences throughout the country.<br><br>
I am grateful to you, Mr. Anderson, for allowing me to speak at length on the problems that occur because of regional differences throughout the country. I hope that the Government will ensure that pilot schemes take account of regional differences.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Tony Wright <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for long, but I want to refer to the two areas covered by the amendments. The first concerns the distribution of general practitioners and the role of the Medical Practices Committee. The purpose of the amendment is to strengthen the committee and I want to put on the record its response to some comments that I made on Second Reading. The Medical Practices Committee took exception to my comment that if all was well in the best of all possible worlds, we would not have the present inequitable distribution of general practitioners. The committee revealed some
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
interesting information, namely, that, of the 15 remaining unadopted or open areas in the country reporting on their progress in reducing that number, two are in my constituency. I want to make amends to the Medical Practices Committee by recording the way in which it sought to interest the health authority in the matter. It discussed with the health authority what it could do about the problem jointly. That was to the committee's great credit. I was struck by the central point in a letter from the MPC, which stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"As the MPC has power of negative direction only, it cannot make GPs go to areas of greatest need, even if it has created the vacancies".</p></blockquote>
I suggest that that is the central point. If we are serious about matching health provision with health need, a power of negative direction is not sufficient. We must be able to put the resources where they are required.<br><br>
I spoke so enthusiastically about the Bill precisely because I saw the possibility of its intervening in areas such as I have described, where the existing planning machinery has not produced the answer to the problems of under-provision.<br><br>
The amendments would give the MPC the role that it needs in the allocation of doctor arrangements. I do not want medical bodies to be able to prevent important developments, but I want them to press for those developments.<br><br>
I turn to what has been called the whistle-blower amendment—amendment No. 107. I do so only because I have a track record. A couple of years ago I introduced a ten-minute Bill—the Whistleblower Protection Bill, which was taken up as a private Member's Bill the following year as the Public Interest Disclosure Bill by my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig). Despite being high on the list of private Member's Bills, the Government took an instant dislike to it and managed to kill it. That was scandalous. That Bill was extensively consulted upon for about two years. It won widespread support from a range of business and voluntary organisations, all of which had come to understand that having whistleblower provisions in law would greatly help them to detect fraud and maladministration and to prevent unpleasant things from happening. One response to the attempt to insert whistleblower protection into legislation is to say that it makes life more uncomfortable for those who provide services. The point that we should understand, however, is that it makes life easier. All our evidence—this was echoed by Lord Nolan when he considered these matters—shows that we discover that things are going wrong when people inside organisations tell us that they are going wrong. That has emerged from inquiry after inquiry and case after case—right up to the recent spate of dreadful child abuse incidents in children's homes.<br><br>
We are not using a rhetorical ploy when we say that it is important to ensure that general practitioners' current independence and their right to speak out should be preserved when we change their status and they change from being independent contractors to salaried employees. The Government will tell us that codes have already been issued on the behaviour of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0534">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 129</span>
health service employees in such matters. There are such codes, and we could discuss whether they were adequate, although we have no time now. When they were first issued, they said something the extraordinary—that health service employees could talk to Members of Parliament about their concerns only after they had told their employers. That seems to many of us to be a breach of the relationship between ourselves and the people we represent, who should be able to talk to us about anything at any time.<br><br>
Nothing in the amendment says that people should not go through the official channels or seek to raise matters internally first—that was an explicit part of the Bill to which I referred. When setting up schemes and new arrangements, however, it is important to ensure that those involved—particularly when they move from independent contractor to salaried status—are not prevented from raising public interest concerns about events inside those operations. I hope, therefore, that the Government will take a more generous view of the amendment than they did of the Bill to which I referred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley <span class='memberconstituency'>(York)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I too will seek to be brief. I had the opportunity on Second Reading to talk in some detail about the distribution of primary care resources and of general practitioners in different parts of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. I do not intend to repeat my arguments. The Minister of State replied briefly at the time, and I hope that he will now be able to give us a more considered response to the current inequitable distribution of GP resources.<br><br>
In a sense, that issue goes to the heart of the Bill. If the Bill results in health authorities being able to use pilot schemes—which they will be able to do—to improve primary care services in areas where they are inadequate, I would welcome and endorse it, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich (Ms Jowell) said, to the extent that it provides an opportunity simply to deregulate primary care as a medical discipline, it worries me greatly. It would tend to concentrate not only resources, but innovation and new thinking in areas where primary care was the strongest and, which, because they were nice to live in, attracted people to practice there.<br><br>
I support amendment No. 43, which will require the Government, when implementing the Bill, to ensure that provision of personal and general medical services in each part of the country is adequate. I also support the amendment of the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham).<br><br>
On Second Reading I welcomed the Government's decision to introduce this year, for the first time, a needs-based element in the distribution of resources for primary care. It was their first stab at doing that, and I do not criticise them for not having a fully developed formula at this stage. I congratulate them on bringing it in this year.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 130</span>
5.15 pm<br><br>
The new formula is based on the relation between need and utilisation of services in the actute sector, that is, on the needs weighting that is used for the hospital and community health services formula. In time, we will see a primary care needs-based funding weighting related to the need for primary care. Will the Minister give us an idea of the time scale for the work that his Department has commissioned to develop a primary care-based needs weighting for those services?<br><br>
I greatly enjoyed the contribution of the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East. It was a very good speech—until the end, when it started to become a Thomson directory for health appliances. Its core point was that there is a correlation between the distribution of resources for primary care and the health status of the population.<br><br>
I asked the Library to examine, region by region, the needs weighting that the Government introduced this year for primary care and to let me know to what extent this year's primary care funding for health authorities in each region is above or below the target figure set by the Government's weighted capitation target for primary care. The two regions that are furthest below target are north thames region and north-west region, about which the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East spoke. North Thames region is £1.22 per patient below target, while north-west region is 95p per patient below. That is about 6 per cent. below target, which means that each patient in the north west is getting 6 per cent. less than their needs-related fair share of the primary healthcare budget.<br><br>
The two regions that are currently funded most above target are south and west and Anglia and Oxford region. In the former, each patient is funded £1.48 per patient or 9.5 per cent. above the target allocation for the region, based on the health status of the population, while for the latter the figure is £1.88 per patient or 12.1 per cent. above target.<br><br>
The Government clearly intend to shift resources over time, presumably by using growth money rather than cutting the money that is available for primary care in regions that are relatively well provided for. Can the Minister indicate the time scale for that shifting of resources? Until we know that, people in north-west region—and, indeed, in west midlands region, northern and Yorkshire region and in Trent region, which are all funded below target—will not get their fair share of primary health care resources. That will affect the health status of people who live in those areas.<br><br>
To illustrate the point, I checked the four regions that are furthest from target—north Thames and north-west regions, which are funded below target and south and west and Anglia and Oxford regions, which are funded above target—against the public health common data set on a range of public health indicators. I found, for example, that in the underfunded north Thames and north-west regions the proportion of low-birth-weight babies—a good
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0535">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 131</span>
indicator of the state of the population as a whole—was above the national average. In contrast, the proportion of low-birth-weight babies in the two regions funded above the national average—southwest and Anglia and Oxford—was below the national average. So, those regions that have more money for primary care have a population with less of a burden of ill health.<br><br>
If one examines all the indicators—the stillbirth rate, the age standardised mortality rate per 100,000 people, the standardised ratio for all causes of illness and for all avoidable causes of illness—one finds that they show a higher burden of ill health in the underfunded regions than in the better funded regions. For example, the 1993 age standardised mortality rate per 100,000 people in the north Thames region shows that 754 people per 100,000 died. In the north-west region, the equivalent figure was 872, but in the southwest it was 708. In Anglia and Oxford, the figure was 722 per 100,000.<br><br>
The death rate in the underfunded regions is higher than in the better funded regions. The figure showing years of life lost as a result of avoidable disease per 10,000 members of the population is higher in the north Thames and north-west regions than in the south-west and the Anglia and Oxford regions.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East said, those figures illustrate a problem that was brought to our attention some 17 years ago in the Black report. The inequalities in health have widened rather than narrowed in that time, although the general health status of the population has improved. It would be extraordinary if it had not improved—it has got better in every developed, industrialised country in the world. However, in terms of people's expectation of living a long and healthy life, the gap between rich and poor and north and south has widened. No hon. Member can believe that that is a satisfactory outcome of health policy.<br><br>
We now have a tool to evaluate whether the distribution of primary health care resources fuels or reduces inequalities. The Bill offers the Government a mechanism to tackle health inequalities and to reduce the gap. I shall listen with care to the Minister's reply to the debate to ascertain whether the Conservative Government intend to use the tool available in the Bill—and the distributional formula on whose introduction I have congratulated them—to reduce health inequalities in this country, specifically and as a matter of policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an important debate. Two specific matters were raised, and another, wider one was discussed by the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East. I shall begin by responding to the points made by the hon. Member for York (Mr. Bayley) and I shall do so in the context of the Medical Practices Committee and the distribution of general practitioners. The hon. Member for York appeared to concentrate on the general distribution of resources, which is a slightly wider matter but where GPs go and are able to work will depend on it.<br><br>
It may be helpful to the Committee if I first clear up the point raised by the hon. Member for Dulwich, who
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 132</span>
was worried about the checking of doctors' qualifications. Health authorities already do such checking. I shall return later to the functions of MPC exercises. Presently, there is a double-checking system in that the MPC also considers the, information provided by the health authority.<br><br>
What has not emerged from our debate so far is the important relationship that has already grown up between the MPC and health authorities in providing information about local need on which the MPC eventually bases its decisions. That partnership has been growing for some time. As the hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Dr. Wright) pointed out, the MPC as an organisation has a power of negative resolution—it can declare a vacancy but it cannot compel anyone to fill it. It can identify an area of underdoctoring and agree to a vacancy being filled when an application is made. The Bill addresses the other side of the important coin better than through the corollary of what the hon. Gentleman said.<br><br>
I cannot envisage what the MPC would do if it had a positive power to fill vacancies—how it would dragoon anyone into a vacancy who was not prepared to go there voluntarily. That is why it is important for the Bill to recognise the role of the MPC with respect to part I arrangements.<br><br>
I shall now turn to the detail of discussions about the proper role of the MPC. I willingly concede that there was considerable debate within the Government about the right way to put a mechanism in place that would allow us to maintain a national overview of the GP work force. As the hon. Member for Dulwich and her hon. Friends pointed out, one of the most important aspects of the Bill is that it provides an opportunity to deal with inefficiencies throughout the system. We considered the problem at great length and consulted all interested parties, widely. It is clear that many organisations made representations to the hon. Lady and her hon. Friends. I suggest that many of the initial concerns upon which those representations were based have now been allayed. I thought that that point had been dealt with in another place where similar amendments—though not exactly similar—were withdrawn. It has been useful to have this debate of substance on the issue.<br><br>
I want to explain the Government's perspective in the context of amendments Nos. 111 and 112, which fully reflect Government decisions. As I said earlier in Committee and on Second Reading, one of the recurrent themes in the primary care listing exercise was the need to improve equity in the distribution of general medical services—the issue rightly raised by the hon. Member for York. We have' always been committed to ensuring a coherent balance between local and national views of the GP work force and ensuring that decisions on pilots and more permanent arrangements take place within that framework. That is why we have had lengthy discussions with all concerned.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
We reached the conclusion that the distribution of GPs within a local authority area should be subject to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0536">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 133</span>
light-touch national safeguards. We decided that the best way to achieve that would be to bring together the undoubted expertise of the MPC and of the resource allocation group, which has been doing increasingly good work in this sector, to establish the framework for the distribution of GPs between authorities. It is important that distribution according to need is understood in the context of the triumvirate of expertise given by health authorities, the resource allocation group and the MPC.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
I should like to pay tribute to the role of the Medical Practices Committee in all that it has done in a statutory framework, which is nearly 50 years old, to maintain, within its powers, proper distribution of general practitioners across the country. It is possible that the Bill will give the MPC the chance to enhance its role in part I arrangements to participate in a meaningful way so that its great experience can be recognised and will endure.<br><br>
I shall set out to the Committee the detailed way forward. The first step will be to issue early guidance to all health authorities to ensure that they work jointly to develop primary healthcare work force plans with local medical committees to reflect a particular need for development within their areas. Those plans will become the reference point for MPC decisions and practice vacancies, and subsequently the Secretary of State's decisions on pilots.<br><br>
The second step will be to establish local plans within the national framework for national health service work force planning so that the profession, the MPC and the resource allocation experts are able exceptionally to comment on plans and raise concerns with the Secretary of State. That will ensure that the MPC has the necessary detailed information for discharging its continuing duties in relation to part II services.<br><br>
Joint work will be established between the resource allocation group, the MPC and representatives of the profession and health authorities to analyse relative need for general practitioners between health authorities and to set the framework for the way in which the MPC should operate in the new arrangements. The national view of relative need will set parameters for the MPC's decisions on part II practice vacancies and the Secretary of State's decisions on pilots. The Government envisage that such a national body will have a continuing role in work force matters.<br><br>
The next step will be to ensure that effective local planning in the new framework is in place by 1 April 1999 so that a coherent view of the work force and the fair distribution of GPs as they relate to both new and existing arrangements can be achieved. I hope that I can convince the Committee that there is a firm view about how progress should proceed.<br><br>
That brings me to the parallel point raised by the hon. Member for York about cash allocations within
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 134</span>
general medical services cash limited resources. Perhaps I can point out to him that the weighted capitation formula was introduced, other than for out-of-hours developments, in 1997–98. It incorporated two measures of need—age-related need and additional need. It also incorporated a measure of cost—a market forces factor. I am grateful to him for acknowledging the work carried out by the Government and officials in developing the formulae, which he agreed are difficult to get right. It is important that we continue to develop them. They mark a step towards achieving a fairer distribution of resources. No formula is perfect, but we are dealing with an evolving process. The formula will be kept under constant review to take advantage of more advanced statistical techniques and latest information. To incorporate that in a robust way that leads to greater equity in developing the formula and in adding other indicators is a matter of constant evolution on which we are happy to be persuaded.<br><br>
The hon. Member for York made the point about how matters stand in the move towards targets across the country. The gist of the hon. Gentleman's comments in a speech or an article—I make no apology for not remembering his words verbatim—was that there was no point in thinking that one could move towards a more equitable health service without the underpinning factor of continuing real resources being devoted to it. I seem to recollect that the hon. Member for York was talking about politics in the context of another party rather closer to home when he said that any policy not based on that principle was likely to be seen as unreasonable. That is the basis on which movement towards target in terms both of GMSCL and of HCHS resources is made by a Government who have consistently applied increasing real-term resources to the health service.<br><br>
It is not possible to meet targets in one leap. One of the reasons why that would not be satisfactory, as the hon. Member for York would concede in any event, is that we have an ongoing debate about changing the formulae and making them more responsive. Targets change over time, but, as they have set out a trend, so the Government have consistently moved towards them.<br><br>
The hon. Member for York asked for a specific time scale. I cannot give him that, but I can tell him that Ministers consider a number of criteria when they examine such matters: one is equity. We endeavour to move within the increasing resources towards targets wherever possible, but are always conscious of the fact that there are two points: first, in a growing health service, it is fair to share at least a proportion of the growing resources around the service so that people throughout Britain feel that there is planning for growth. We have been able to do that in recent years and I hope that all Committee members will welcome that. Secondly, it is important when adjusting resource allocation, be it in primary care or in HCHS allocations, to ensure that it is not done in a disruptive way—that would dislocate the provision of health services, which I do not believe would be welcome.<br><br>
I hope that my comments will underpin to the hon. Gentleman the importance that the Government attach
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0537">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 135</span>
to the issues that he raised. The matter is ongoing and is seen specifically in the context of our ability exactly to deal through the legislation with the problem of inadequate doctoring in certain parts of Britain. Of course, I take on board the fact that there is considerable frustration in primary care because it is not possible to provide proper doctoring in every area. That is one of the problems that the Bill is designed to cure. I suggest that the current system for examining medical manpower—general practitioners—is more sophisticated than the one that was formerly in place in terms of part II arrangements and I hope that the Committee will consider the issue in that light.<br><br>
I turn to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East. In the context of the other services that he mentioned that were not entirely within the scope of the amendment, of course, the same applies: the purpose of the Bill is to enable people to allocate resources to the areas of need. That applies to all areas in which general practitioners might be interested and to dentists who take an interest in oral health. I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance.<br><br>
Amendment (a) would require the Secretary of State to
<br><blockquote><p>"report annually to Parliament on the distribution of general practitioners".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Bolton, North-East did not dwell too much on that point, but I shall deal with it anyway. Statistics relating to general practice, which include the number of GPs and their distribution, are already placed in the Library twice a year for England and Wales and annually for Scotland, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that his amendment deals with matters that are already satisfied.<br><br>
The other important debate, which was introduced by the hon. Member for Dulwich, dealt with what is commonly known as whistleblowing or as gagging charters. We hear much about such matters in the press and from Opposition Members. Of course, they must be right: there must be a gaggers' charter under which no medical practitioner or nurse can speak out because every morning when I listen to "Today", I never hear a doctor or a nurse. When I woke up this morning and I watched BBC breakfast television, I was clearly seeing an illusion when I watched a programme about what had been happening to emergency services in London. When I reached the Department, clearly I read the only newspapers in the country that contain reports about what is happening in the NHS and in hospitals. I do not mean to suggest that this is not an important matter, but the hon. Lady's argument is rather overdone.<br><br>
The Opposition have often discussed whistleblowing. It is a difficult matter of which we constantly have to be aware. However, the matter is well dealt with in the Bill. An Opposition Member referred to the important guidance that we issued in June 1993. It sets out the rights and responsibilities of all NHS-employed staff—not simply medical and nursing staff—to raise concerns about healthcare issues, and it will apply to the staff who take part in pilots.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
The hon. Lady raised an ancillary point about what would happen to staff who have different contracts of employment, and for whom the standard clause that applies in national contracts is not in place. Of course, all the contracts that apply in the NHS have to be seen in the light of that guidance, which is explicit—it provides a framework in which local employers can develop local procedures to handle the relevant staff. It also complements professional and ethical guidelines and codes of practice.<br><br>
The hon. Lady was right to point out that many healthcare professionals have other standards by which they must abide, including professional codes of ethics. I expect them to abide by those codes. In professional matters, the professional ethic rules. Many people have implied that our guidance is sinister or something similar. However, it stresses an important point that is often omitted by Opposition Members when they discuss it which is that it encourages staff to take on board the fact that if there is a problem, they have a positive responsibility to take it up with management, to discuss it and to seek to have it resolved. Far from encouraging staff to remain silent and to avoid resolving matters, the guidance's impetus is that those concerned should do something about it. It also clearly states that whatever they say should be taken seriously by managers and that their comments should receive full and sympathetic consideration.<br><br>
The guidance makes plain the basis on which NHS staff can raise their concerns about the health services and it recognises the major principles—which are extremely important and which no Committee member would wish to breach—of patient confidentiality and fidelity to an employer, which I make no apology for mentioning. Those principles hold unless an employee concludes that in his assessment the public interest outweighs the relevant needs. As I recall from when I last read it, the guidance also stresses the fact that that balance has to be struck by the employee. He may of course make a judgment that is ill-founded—he may make a casual judgment that it is much more fun to take the matter to the local press than to resolve it through the normal channels in the relevant hospital. I do not mean to suggest that the fundamental right to raise such matters will be impaired in any way.<br><br>
Salaried GPs who take part in those arrangements under part I will be subject to the same arrangements as other employees, and they will retain their professional integrity. Such matters do not arise in the same way for GPs taking part in the new arrangements: they are guided by professional ethics in the way that they deal with the public's medical problems in the wider NHS.<br><br>
I hope that I have allayed some of the concerns about the matter. We have had an important debate, and I hope that the Opposition will not press the amendments to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must briefly reply to one point that the Minister made and to one point that he did. He referred, delicately and obliquely, to something that I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0538">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 137</span>
wrote some time ago and which has been widely circulated by Conservative central office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is very useful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that is is very useful. It would have been more useful and would have better informed the public if he had quoted what I said in full, which was that the rate of growth provided for the NHS by the last Labour Government was considerably greater than the rate of growth since 1979 under this Government. I simply wanted to put that on the record.<br><br>
My second question, which the Minister did not answer, was whether the Government intended to use their cash allocation formula for cash-limited general medical services and the Bill's provisions, as a matter of direct Government policy, to reduce health inequalities in the United Kingdom. What is the Government's opinion on that?</span></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to that second point. I shall allow the hon. Gentleman to set the record straight in his own way and leave others to read <i>Hansard</i> and be their own judges of the matter.<br><br>
The Bill's purpose is to promote a service that provides better health care for patients. It is founded on the principle that there should be better equality of distribution according to need, as identified in a formula that applies nationally. That principle applies both to allocations for HCHS and for GMS cash-limited resources. I do not want to dance on the head of a pin in terms of terminology, but the implication must be that if services are improving for a range of patients and we are taking measures to attack demonstrated need, there is little difference between the hon. Gentleman and me on the principle or purpose of the Bill. But it is not within the Government's or anyone else's power to say that the Bill will achieve what the hon. Gentleman suggests. We can set objectives for changes in primary care and, of course, consider the effects.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I clarify what the Minister just said? He said that he did not believe that reducing health inequalities lay within the Government's power. I am happy to give way to the Minister if he will confirm that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will make the point in the words that I choose to use and not in the hon. Lady's words. We have power in government to set in place mechanisms that we hope will achieve certain results. The results of this legislation will be an improvement in primary health-care services. We shall be able to target resources more closely on identified need—need that is identified by health authorities that have responsibility for considering such issues. Those are the terms in which I choose to express the Bill's purpose.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 138</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To return to this morning's debate, if we were assured that there would be clear evaluation criteria, perhaps the yardsticks to which the Minister refers would be explicit and provide some public benchmark of the Government's success in meeting the targets that the legislation intends to achieve. The Minister's remarks in responding to the debate, coupled with his extraordinary refusal to accept the need for including clear evaluation criteria in the Bill, give us no confidence that the Government are serious about creating any purposeful link between the Bill's powers and the inequalities and inadequacies in primary care experienced by so many of our constituents.<br><br>
I should like to deal briefly with two other matters. The hon. Member for Bolton, North-East made an interesting proposal when he suggested an annual report on the availability of GPs. The Minister should realise that to say that information is available because it is placed in the House of Commons Library, does not carry much conviction beyond the precincts of the Palace of Westminster. Even that is regarded with some scepticism here and is regarded as a way in which to hide information rather than to shed light on any matter.<br><br>
I shall refer now to our concerns about whistleblowing. I regret the fact that the Minister sought to parody what the amendment would secure. He should read carefully what is said by people who speak out about conditions in the health service. In most cases, such people will have some immunity because they are trade union representatives or representatives of professional bodies.<br><br>
Each hospital should have proper management procedures whereby matters of complaint and concern can be raised. If some junior members of staff believe, for example, that the management of the hospital, the trust or the unit in which they work is the reason for their complaint or the cause of the act of neglect that they wish to raise, they are not likely to go to management representatives confident that they will take the necessary purposeful action.<br><br>
We are talking about a belt-and-braces approach to ensure that, if people are being harmed in the secrecy of a hospital or in the secrecy of what is a highly trusting relationship, we maximise and not compromise the protection that can be afforded to them. It is a great pity that the Minister has not recognised that the amendment is not being advocated as the only way in which matters of concern must be raised. It would be a course that is open to staff. Staff who pursue such action do so only after heart-searching and careful thought.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Hendry <span class='memberconstituency'>(High Peak)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: How can the hon. Lady ensure that people will not take advantage of such action for malicious reasons? For example, some people who have been dismissed when they have not performed well have sought maliciously to damage the organisation for which they formerly worked. It seems that such people could claim protection under the whistleblower's charter. By the time the reasons for their action were discovered, the damage would have been done. The matter would

have been highlighted on the front pages of newspapers and broadcast on the local television channels, and the damage that they wanted to do would have been done. What redress could be taken against those people?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely the hon. Gentleman's point. I have had experience of individuals who are pursuing vendettas because of malice, as I am sure have other members of the Committee. People come to our surgeries with dossiers of information about wrongdoings of one sort or another and, as Members of Parliament, we must judge whether those who are making such claims are genuinely motivated to do so. It is my view, and I suspect that it is the view of other hon. Members, that people who are pursuing a vendetta that is motivated by nothing but malice reveal themselves before they do the damage that the hon. Member has suggested.<br><br>
I do not wish to delay the Committee further in what I think has been a full and useful debate. I have listened to what the Minister said in response to our concerns about the Medical Practices Committee. We shall return to a more specific debate about the role of that committee later in our proceedings. I beg your indulgence, Mr. Anderson, to move amendment No. 107 formally at the appopriate time. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
There are two issues raised in the group of amendments. Amendment No. 46 is another example of a minimum service requirement that we raised in the Committee last Thursday. Amendments Nos. 44, 45, 69 and 70 deal with the right to information, which is another important issue of the Bill and of health policy as a whole. It was raised by the shadow Secretary of State for Health in reference to public participation in the health service. Information is crucial to any meaningful participation in the health service and that is a central reason for it. There are other reasons for providing meaningful information so that the health service as a whole can be held to account. In this case, the reason for providing information is so that patients can make decisions about themselves and, in particular, can have confidence in the new pilot arrangements.<br><br>
The right to information falls into three areas. First, there should be information about what services are offered in pilots, compared with general medical or dental services. That is important so that the public can be reassured about and have confidence in the pilots. They must know that the same minimum standards are being offered by the pilots as by general medical or dental services.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 45 and 70 state that there should be information about what would happen if the pilot scheme should be terminated or varied and that patients should know what their rights are to withdraw from the scheme and the consequences of doing that.<br><br>
Clause 3(2) refers to any participant in a scheme withdrawing, except the health authority or board. However, there is no reference to the way in which patients' interests would be protected in such a situation. That is the issue at stake. The Consumers Association has expressed concern. It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Patients should understand that where a pilot scheme may be terminated, alternative arrangements may be difficult to make."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Minister could comment on that.<br><br>
What happens when a large number of patients are left without provision following the termination of a pilot? Again, the Consumers Association suggests that the Medical Practices Committee might need to be involved in advertising for a replacement.<br><br>
Patients who are being served by pilots will need to have clear information about what would happen in the event of it being terminated. Clearly, that is a possibility because it is explicitly mentioned in the Bill. Concerns about services are even greater when we turn to dental services. Of course, there is no right for an individual to be put on a dentist's list. Perhaps the Minister could address those concerns.<br><br>
Amendment No. 46 requires that pilot scheme doctors providing personal medical services should be obliged to offer emergency treatment and treatment for temporary residents in the same way as part II GPs. That is another minimum service requirement that is necessary for there to be equity between

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
patients using pilots and those using general medical and dental services.<br><br>
The BMA has expressed concern about the matter. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Without such an obligation, gaps in service provision may arise between personal medical services and general medical services areas".</p></blockquote>
6 pm<br><br>
People may not mind if pilots bring about improvements, but they do not want any dimunition of services on offer. It is desirable to have such an explicit guarantee included in the Bill and we would like to hear the Government's view on that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can set at rest the mind of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) on the specific points that he raised. He referred to the first criterion of amendment No. 45 which is that patients are
<br><blockquote><p>"to be informed about what services will be offered them in comparison with provision under general medical or dental services".</p></blockquote>
I agree with the principal that there should be adequate information about such matters. However, I beg to differ with him about whether the Bill is the correct place in which to set out primary legislation in respect of part I arrangements when it is clearly inappropriate in respect of part II arrangements. Perhaps he is seeking to probe our intentions.<br><br>
The new arrangements aim to improve patient services, allowing them to be delivered in different ways that are better attuned to local needs and circumstances and will promote consistent high quality. GPs will be expected to provide services that will satisfactorily replace the current general medical service, which is available to everyone in our communities. The hon. Gentleman made the important point that, at present, there is no similar right to be registered. However, GPs will either contract for the full range of services currently available under the general dental service or, for specialist services, such as orthodontics or oral surgery.<br><br>
The point that the hon. Gentleman raises is dealt with elsewhere in the legislation. The simple fact is that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will not approve a proposal that does not set out the overall standards and values that will apply and does not have the project's clearly defined aims and objectives. Underpinning that, in a sense, is our discussion this morning: the point is that patients will get a service that is improved not diminished.<br><br>
The second criterion of amendment No. 45 is that patients should
<br><blockquote><p>"be informed about what would happen to them should the scheme be varied or terminated".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
Let me remind the hon. Gentleman of current provision. GP practices already provide, through a range of material, such as practice leaflets, information on the range of services that they offer their patients. That will be an important consideration when examining the arrangements that are proposed for a pilot scheme or the permanent arrangements that will follow. However, that matter is better covered by the contract, which can be backed up through the wide direction-making powers of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, if necessary. One of the reasons why I say that to the hon. Gentleman is that, with patient information, there is a constantly evolving scene of what is better.<br><br>
No doubt the hon. Gentleman has visited a number of general practices and, like me, he will probably have asked GPs what information they give to their patients. It is often of variable quality. We take an interest in that matter to ensure that it can be developed over time. That is happening satisfactorily with current part II arrangements, as an evolutionary process in which GPs and their staff are taking part on a voluntary basis. It is not right that we should set that out in primary legislation.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leith asked what would happen if a GP practice left a pilot or if a pilot was varied in such a way as significantly to affect patient services. Of course we expect practices to notify their patients of any change in service that might result, exactly as is required under the part II arrangements.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the criterion under which patients would be informed about their rights to withdraw from the scheme and the consequences of so doing. The principle from which I approach the matter is that, albeit that we have fascinating debates on Second Reading and in Committee, I do not expect members of the public—who expect a seamless primary care service—to read the <i>Official Report</i> of our proceedings in great detail. I do expect, however, that the delivery of primary care be made to seem a seamless process. That is why the new arrangements will in no way change patients' rights to find a new GP or dentist.<br><br>
Under the Bill, patients will be in the same position, whether they are with a GP or another organisation providing primary care under part I or part II arrangements. They should notice the change only because the quality of service has improved, not because the arrangements, as they affect them, have substantially altered. We anticipate no reason why they might want to leave services that have improved, although I acknowledge that that happens. I give the hon. Member for Leith the firm assurance that patients will not be placed at a disadvantage if they choose to leave their GP. There is a substantial amount of information currently available to the public about how to do that, if they wish. I believe that that information is entirely adequate.<br><br>
Amendment No. 46 deals with the important matter of temporary residence. I suggest to the hon. Member
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0541">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 143</span>
for Leith that that can best be dealt with as a standard term in all health authority contracts with providers, exactly as are other matters that from part of the current terms of service for a GP. It would be in nobody's interest for the existing arrangements for the immediate and necessary treatment of a temporary resident not to be picked up in the new arrangements.<br><br>
The GP terms of service are currently set out in regulations. It would be bizarre if, as we move to a more flexible contracting system, we were to elevate to primary legislation everything that we expect GPs to do under their terms of service—that is a matter for contracting. It is important that the service remains firmly in place, and the hon. Gentleman rightly asked for reassurance about that.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will agree that the amendments are not necessary to ensure that quality standards are maintained in the schemes set up under the Bill. I hope that the debate has been useful and that I have been able to cast some light on the Government's intentions.</span></p>

MAKING OF PILOT SCHEMES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 49, in page 4, line 1, leave out "implementing proposals" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"receiving notification of approval from the Secretary of State'.</p></blockquote>
I hope that the amendment will not detain the Committee for too long. The clause as drafted requires health authorities to publish details of pilot schemes
<br><blockquote><p>"As soon as reasonably practicable"</p></blockquote>
when implementing them. The amendment would require details to be published as soon as practicable after
<br><blockquote><p>"receiving notification of approval from the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
That would ensure that people had a chance to comment on proposed schemes and raise matters of concern before they were established. The implementation of pilot schemes will rely heavily on their securing local support and cooperation, and we believe that expediting the announcement of the decision would serve that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to respond constructively to the hon. Lady, because it is important that proper notification be given. For the benefit of the Committee I shall set out what clause 4 provides. It provides for publication to take place after schemes have been implemented—that is, after contracts have been drawn up and signed. That is the crucial point. There are two stages in the process, the first being
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0542">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
consultation about the proposals when they are in a formative state. The best possible moment to introduce them to the consuming public and to those who will use the services is at one of certainty. That would be most beneficial to those likely to be affected by the proposals in terms of service provision.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
Once approved, the scheme might, for various reasons and in several respects, be varied. There could be some changes between the point of approval by the Secretary of State—which is the point at which the hon. Lady seeks to place the proposals in the public domain for the scrutiny of those who are likely to be affected—and the stage of certainty when contracts are signed. I am not saying that those changes would be radical; that would invite a revision of the whole procedure. However, I set several practical tests. There may be some changes in staff—for example, one of the GPs may retire in the interim to be replaced by another, or working through the proposals in the contracting process may reveal several flaws in the plans which require correcting. Exceptionally, some providers may also choose to drop out of pilots after approval, but before implementation. The rest of clause 4 provides for those matters, so there would be no virtue in publishing the details of them. I suggest to the hon. Lady that it constitutes unfinished business and that rather than publishing proposals that may not continue to the conclusion of the contracting process, the right moment to do so is when the contract is concluded—when there is certainty in the provision of the service. That is a better moment than the one the amendment would provide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not wholly convinced by the Minister's response because it is perfectly possible, without going into great detail about the personnel involved, to make public the health service purposes and benefits of a pilot scheme. However, in view of the Minister's position—unconvincing though it is—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 4, line 4, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(5) A participant in a pilot scheme (other than the authority concerned) may withdraw on reasonable notice at any time after the proposals relating to him have been implemented."</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that GPs are allowed to withdraw from the pilot, on giving reasonable notice, if they wish to do so. It is clearly in patients' interests that where pilots are thought to be failing, for whatever reason, GPs who wish to withdraw and revert to their previous contractual arrangements are able to do so. The amendment is intended, in the interests of all concerned, to make that process as easy and speedy as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to reinforce that point about which there is not only agreement, but alternative and proper provision in the Bill. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
amendment is unnecessary. I agree with the hon. Lady that the whole tenor of the debate has been one of encouraging voluntary participation, in not only the lead-up to pilot schemes but throughout the implementation period and the institution of permanent arrangements. A guarantee is already included in clause 3(2), which provides that a pilot scheme cannot go forward unless it includes satisfactory provision for a participant to withdraw. That is a comprehensive provision which applies both before and after implementation of the schemes. In effect, therefore, all the amendment adds is a reference to notice and in the practical world, it is inconceivable that the Secretary of State would not include in his consideration of withdrawal arrangements the need for a reasonable period of notice.<br><br>
In any case, we envisage that that would be a standard term in the contract between providers and health authorities. Neither party to the contract would be able to progress without robust provision being made for the ending of pilots schemes, or for individual providers to leave.<br><br>
I know that people in the profession have always questioned the Government's determination to allow withdrawal from schemes should practitioners decide to do so. I understand the hon. Lady's need for reassurance, but what is in the Bill and what would be found in normal arrangements for giving notice would be sufficient to meet that requirement. I suggest that she should consider withdrawing the amendment.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>(1A) In the case of any other pilot scheme, all of those providing, or purposing to provide, piloted services under the scheme may together make an application under this section to become a single health service body.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 120 to 123.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with some outstanding points about how NHS contracts will work in piloted arrangements. The aim is to ensure that the benefits of the NHS—simplicity and dispute resolution by the Secretary of State—can play a full part in the new arrangements.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 119 to 122 make clear who may apply to become a health service body. These provisions relate exclusively to those who provide or propose to provide piloted services. Under new clauses 19 and 20—the Committee will recollect that they were tabled last week—and the further amendments that we undertook to table, the provisions of clause 14 will apply only to members of the NHS. They are consequential and tidying amendments.<br><br>
Individual GPs and dental practitioners can already apply to become health service bodies under the Bill. The amendments make it more clear that applications can be made by various groupings from within the NHS family—for example partnerships of GPs. They ensure that such groupings can comprise a single health service body, sharing the same NHS contract. They ensure also that once such a group has been granted health service body status, each time its membership changes—for example, if one partner in a partnership retires and is replaced by another—it does not have to reapply for such status.<br><br>
Of course, if the body changes in such a way that would make it non-qualifying for any other reason, it would not be able to fulfil the purposes of the contract. It would not have vires to do so. The provision fits in well with the flexibility in the provision of services that the Bill aims to permit. It will give appropriate groupings of providers access to the full benefits of health service body status.<br><br>
Finally, amendment No. 123 will remove a power that will be provided elsewhere in the Bill. I commend the amendments to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends and I have several detailed questions on the drafting of the amendments. We want to ensure that the Bill does not permit the commercialisation of primary care through sleight of hand, drafting error or drafting intention. We do not want the Bill to allow private companies to employ doctors or nurses, to set up pilot schemes or to accelerate the dangerous process of the commercialisation of the NHS.<br><br>
The history of the amendments and new clauses tabled on this matter fills us with no confidence about the Government's competence or conviction. The British Medical Association's hostility has brought the Government to this position, rather than their own
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
conviction. Having said that, why is the term "body corporate" used in amendment No. 119, rather than "qualifying body"? Can the Minister reassure the Committee that that will not allow commercial interests to become health service bodies?<br><br>
At this late stage in Committee proceedings, we are still waiting for the Minister to table further amendments and new clauses. Presumably, they will not be tabled until Report. That is yet further evidence of both the chaotic management of the Bill and its extremely sloppy drafting. It is very usual for the Government to be still tabling such important amendments at short notice, and we are deeply sceptical about it.<br><br>
I look forward to the Minister's response, but we know that he has had to trim his words to some extent to ensure that the BMA is happy with the formulation reached. I know that the BMA is not entirely happy with the use of the term "body corporate"; all the BMA's instincts make it suspicious of it, as are my hon. Friends and I. Our concern is that this position has been reached not because the Government believe it to be right but because they fear a BMA campaign before the general election.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are going round a race track that we went round at some length during my not entirely successful attempts to convince the hon. Lady about what we meant in this connection. I can give an assurance, for the <i>Official Report,</i> that the amendments are entirely consonant with my previous undertakings on commercialisation.<br><br>
The hon. Lady raised a specific point about the use of the term "body corporate". When those who are qualified to contract with health authorities for the provision of arrangements under part I of the Bill wish to band together in partnership or some other vehicle, the question of "body corporate" will arise. That is why it is in the Bill. However, I can reassure her that only individuals and bodies that are members of the NHS family, as now defined by the Bill, will be able to use those provisions. The term "body corporate" must be seen in that context. I hope that the hon. Lady will be reassured by that undertaking, which is the firmest I can give on what I concede to be an important point.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"including cessation at that person's request".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would allow GPs to cease to be NHS bodies, if they wished, either on withdrawal from a pilot scheme or if they wanted to change their method of dealing with contracts. Clause 14 allows potential and actual providers of personal medical services to apply to the Secretary of State to become health service bodies. One result is that certain arrangements made with other health bodies would be NHS contracts. The Bill must ensure that the prescribed circumstances permitting a person to cease to be a health service body include cessation at that person's request.<br><br>
For an NHS body, any contracts entered into are not legally enforceable, and the Secretary of State is required to arbitrate in disputes. That provision was contained in section 4 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990. We believe that that flexibility should be preserved for GPs who may want to leave pilots or come out of the system to have legally binding contracts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is helpful for me to be able to clarify this point. The hon. Lady pointed out that the amendment would ensure that the providers of services in pilot schemes could withdraw from their contractual status as health service bodies if they chose to do so. Many of the arguments that I deployed against amendment No. 28 apply in this case.<br><br>
I can give the hon. Member for Dulwich an assurance. The Bill already provides a regulatory framework to deal with a health service body which ceases to have that status. Just as providers of services will be able to choose to become health service bodies, so they will be able to stop being health service bodies, subject to sensible transitional arrangements. I am sure that the hon. Lady will have no quarrel with that. The choice is implicit in the voluntary principle that is behind not just this initiative, but the legislation.<br><br>
Clause 14(7) specifically allows for regulations to set out how the provisions will work in practice. clearly, if a provider wants to give up health service body status in mid-contract, that will have all sorts of contractual implications and implications for the survival of the pilot and for the patients involved. That will need to be spelt out in advance of implementation of a scheme. In any case, contracts will have to be crystal clear on what happens in such circumstances.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
As all arrangements, including health service body status, are entered into voluntarily, providers will be able to ensure that everything is satisfactory before they enter a scheme. For a scheme to be satisfactory, it must be complete in terms of the legislation, and that covers the approach to entry into and exit from the scheme. The possibility of exit from a scheme must not result in disruption of patient services, and it should be possible to defend the rights of those working in the pilot.<br><br>
I hope that that clarification is helpful and that the Committee will agree that the amendment, although worthy in intent, is unnecessary.</span></p>

THE DENTAL PRACTICE BOARDS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be a shame for the Committee to approve the clause without paying tribute to the work of the Dental Practice Board and the Scottish Dental Practice Board. They are extraordinary institutions that were created because general dental practitioners are paid a fee per item of service. Hitherto, there has been no need for a parallel body for general medical practitioners, whose remuneration is determined by their contracts.<br><br>
Despite the fact that the Dental Practice Board was set up primarily to approve fees to dental practitioners, it has—incidentally and importantly—the benefit of evaluating and vetting the quality of dental practice carried out by the dentists who claim for fees. When the English and Welsh Dental Practice Board gave evidence to the Select Committee on Health's inquiry into NHS dental services, it told us that in rare but extreme cases it picked up attempts by general dental practitioners to defraud the NHS by claiming for work that was clinically impossible.<br><br>
For instance, we were told that on rare occasions a dentist will claim for the extraction of a tooth which the Dental Practice Board's records show was claimed for as an extraction several years before. It also has a disciplinary function. It will provide evidence of the rare cases of dentists defrauding the NHS, but will also comment on the quality of dental work undertaken by general dental practitioners.<br><br>
It is a useful check to have in the system. Dentists, like doctors, believe that they should have the clinical
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0545">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 151</span>
freedom to carry out the appropriate treatment for a patient. We have in the past considered whether general medical practitioners should submit to an authority, presumably the health authority, a clinical practice plan that explains what the nature of that clinical practice will be. Concern has been expressed that that could interfere with the clinical freedom of a general medical practitioner. Have the Government considered introducing a similar body or similar arrangements to enable health authorities to check on the clinical appropriateness of interventions made by general dental practitioners?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that last question is no, because it would not be appropriate. I should like to use this short debate to join with the hon. Gentleman in his tribute to the Dental Practice Board in England and Wales and the Scottish Dental Practice Board. The whole purpose of the clause is to enable them to extend their expertise in obtaining quality through the dental reference service across the system to the new part I arrangements. It is an important extension of the power. It is one which they broadly welcome, and it will benefit the general delivery of dental health care on both sides of the border.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 15(3)(b) empowers the Dental Practice Board to conduct or commission surveys or other research. Could the Minister clarify what that means? How far would it go? Would it include the effect of fluoride in water? Could pilot practices include the addition of fluoride in certain selected areas? Would that come within the terms of the Bill as a pilot initiative? Can the Government participate in pilot surveys? It has been suggested to me that VAT on fluoride toothpaste should be reduced. Could that be done in a particular area as an innovative experiment to see whether it led to more use of toothpaste and, hence, better oral health? What is the Government's stance towards fluoride legislation? North West Water has said that it would not add fluoride to the water unless the Government introduced legislation to require it to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To remain within the scope of the debate, I have to assure the hon. Gentleman that what he suggests is not within the scope of the Bill. Separate legislation deals with that general policy area, of which he is well aware.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that in my constituency the Liberal Democrat candidate is campaigning against fluoridisation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, but my hon. Friend has made his point. The other points that the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) made concerned matters that are undertaken in general research terms through the oral health budget which is a better way of looking at things than through this Bill.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take Government amendments Nos. 151, 152, 157 and 158.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Last week, I set out for the Committee the new clauses we tabled to prohibit anyone other than specified members of the NHS family from providing piloted services. Amendments Nos. 150 and 151 make equivalent provision for the permanent arrangements that may follow pilot schemes. Amendment No. 150 deals with England and Wales and amendment No. 151 with Scotland.<br><br>
I should like to draw some features of the definition of the NHS family for the purpose of permanent arrangements to the Committee's attention. First, the definition includes those who already provide services in permanent arrangements, and those they employ in connection with the provision of such services. The definition of the NHS family for the purposes of piloting includes those who provide services in pilots, and their employees. It is consistent to extend the definition in that way for the purpose of permanent arrangements. It means, for example, that a nurse who is a partner in a practice and provides services in permanent arrangements will be able to provide services in other permanent arrangements.<br><br>
Secondly, the new provisions ensure that those who are members of the NHS family in Scotland are able to provide services in England and Wales, and vice versa. That is a sensible and congruous way in which to proceed.<br><br>
Members of the Committee may have noticed that some of the definitions in the new provisions are structured differently from those in the equivalent pilot scheme provisions—for example, the definition of medical practitioners who are eligible to be providers of services under the new arrangements. The hon. Member for Dulwich made a point about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 154</span>
that earlier. I assure the Committee that that arises from the different structure of the provisions on pilot and permanent arrangements, and not from differences in substance. I repeat the assurance that I was happy to give the hon. Lady. I confirm that the regulations mentioned in the definition of "qualifying medical practitioner" will include requirements for suitable experience that correspond exactly to those in force for existing arrangements—and to those we have used in the pilot scheme provisions.<br><br>
Amendment No. 152 removes from clause 20 a definition that now appears in the amendments that we propose to clause 19. Amendment No. 103 inserts a definition of "health authority" in the NHS (Scotland) Act 1978.<br><br>
Last week, the Committee agreed to amendment No. 98, which put beyond doubt the ability of NHS trusts to provide piloted services. Amendments Nos. 157 and 158 make equivalent provision in respect of permanent arrangements for England and Wales, and for Scotland. I commend the amendments to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I compliment the Minister on his beautiful reading of the brief. He has no problem with dyslexia, the wattage of the lights or opticians. Unlike me, he does not require attention from the latter.<br><br>
The length and complexity of the amendments, and their late presentation—they arrived by fax on Friday night—to members of the Committee cause problems. A sort of dental procedure has taken place, by which the BMA managed to extract the Government's teeth. It persuaded the Government that, if the Bill was to be passed with the consent of the BMA as the doctors' union, it was vital to restrict or deny commercialisation at port of entry through the measure's pilot provisions. We are happy that the BMA has applied pressure that perhaps an Opposition cannot exert. It has drawn to the Government's attention a problem that is additional to those that they would normally face during the forthcoming electoral and democratic processes.<br><br>
We will be creating trouble for them, of course, but they did not want additional trouble from the BMA. Time after time, the BMA has come back for more and it appears that it has got it. The Government have had to give up the ideas that they may have had—I say this without any mind reading—regarding potential commercialisation and points of entry via the Bill.<br><br>
The Minister referred to Government amendments Nos. 157 and 158 and the way in which they would provide for a trust to provide personal medical services. We are not clear about the parallel with dental services in this respect. The oddity about the Bill is that it goes in the opposite direction of what the Government have had to do in creating new methods of dealing with dentistry. In providing those new methods, the provisions of the Bill were anticipated. The Bill is about pilot schemes to extend primary health care in new directions and forms. That has already been a problem with dental services over the past five or six years because of the problems that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0547">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 155</span>
arose when the previous Secretary of State fell out with the British Dental Association. It was argued that as we already have trusts employing dentists of last resort, we should now have health authorities employing dentists. The Bill does the opposite. Instead of health authorities employing general practitioners, we are talking about the trusts—not the health authorities—employing them.<br><br>
This has been an unintended pilot experiment in the direct employment of the providers of primary health care—in this case dentists, although the pilot scheme would be interesting for general practitioners, despite the difference between the two professions. It would be interesting to regard that as a pilot for the purposes of the Bill, but one which had fortuitously taken place over the past five years. Has the scheme whereby health authorities have employed dentists for the first time worked? If not, fine—one can say so, and explain that that is why doctors will not be permitted to be employed by health authorities under the terms of this pilot scheme. If, however, we said that it had worked, but, for some strange reason, we did not want to use the parallel offered by the Bill, that would be a little odd, as we would have had the benefit of an unintended pilot scheme.<br><br>
The Bill is all about pilot schemes and how to evaluate them. We are saying that we will not evaluate the unintended pilot scheme that has taken place over the past five or six years since health authorities have been employing dentists of last resort when the independent dental contractor service has broken down over large areas of the country. How have the Government sought to evaluate the relative benefits and disbenefits of health authorities rather than trusts employing dentists rather than doctors with respect to the pilot phase that would be initiated by the Bill, considering that they have had a free gift of a pilot scheme that has already taken place in one specific primary health care area?<br><br>
Those are the points that we would like the Minister to take a little further to give us an idea of ministerial thinking about only trusts being the potential employers specified by Government amendments Nos. 157 and 158. I should be grateful for the Minister's comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have picked up in general terms the specific point made by the hon. Gentleman. Let me set this in context. The hon. Gentleman is right that health authorities already have powers directly to employ salaried dentists or to make provision for primary care where none is available.<br><br>
The issue before the Committee is rather different. We are debating proposals—on which the profession was consulted widely—about taking on the new generation of care. The conclusion which flowed from the debate was that the provision should be by means of contracts between health authorities and the profession, either directly with a dentist or through another mechanism—the hon. Gentleman suggested a dentist employed by a trust.<br><br>
It would be wrong to go back on what was clearly an important part of the consultative process—we had
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 156</span>
this debate when discussing a previous amendment—and I again emphasise that, wherever possible, it is desirable to ensure that the function of the health authority, as the purchaser of health care, and the contractor is separated where possible from the role of provider. The Opposition have often suggested that that role should be fudged. I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that that is why we are looking to use the structure that the Committee is considering to develop primary care, both through general practitioners and other professionals who will put the pilots together, and through dental practitioners who will provide that service either as individuals under contract or through trusts. That is why we are considering the structure in such a way.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about evaluation. Simply, the current powers—I am sure that he would concede that this is more relevant to dentistry than to the provision of primary care—are reserved and used differently across the country. I am not sure whether it would be possible to apply what is happening in respect of salaried dentists to the Bill. A reason for that is that the terms on which salaried dentistry is currently provided are highly restrictive—they are not typical—and it would not be desirable to use them as a model for a new generation of the provision of dental care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point is simple: if health authority provisions and employment of salaried dentists have been that bad—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If not—the Minister is indicating dissent—why does he observe that principle as though it were accepted throughout and as though there had been a testing of the fact that there must not be a fudging of the distinction between the direct provision and the purchasing or commissioning of health care? If he is not saying that direct employment of dentists by health authorities is all that bad, what is all the fuss about?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that I made to the hon. Gentleman is that I am not suggesting that it is bad, but that it has always been in the context that there had to be a reserve mechanism to show demonstrated need where care could not be provided by general dental practitioners. A reason why that mechanism had to be present—and was used more often—was that when the health service was set up it was not possible to have a medical practices committee for allocating dentists around the country. Dentists were all self-employed individuals, so the reserve power has clearly been more frequently used.<br><br>
I am not criticising what has happened to salaried dental services. I am saying something entirely different: because the service was intended as a fallback position, the conditions in which it could be provided have, of necessity, been highly constrained. The Bill will roll out broader terms for the future provision of service, so the debate is not a suitable context in which to look for the success criteria which could be applied to the new provisions.</span></p>
