	<p>Government amendments Nos. 130, 131, 136 and 141.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment deals with the right to choose. That is a difficult issue because the British national health service has had a two-way tradition of non-intervention: when a medical practitioner wants to remove a patient from his list, he can do so without giving a reason. The same applies when a person wants to leave one doctor and go to another: there is no compulsion to give a reason or to make arrangements for a replacement to maintain the doctor's list. Patients have no responsibility for maintaining the list size and no reasons have to be given. It is a matter of free choice, which preserves the best doctor-patient relationships, unsullied by considerations of commercial practice, viability for the doctor or problems that the patient might have in finding another doctor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain problems have always attached to the tradition. In rural areas, for instance, there is no effective choice. More recently, doctors have been under greater pressure to be tighter about how far they are willing to travel and to take consideration of the fact that some patients are much more expensive to treat than others. That is the reason for the amendments, which deal with doctors' consent and patient choice. Can a doctor refuse a patient without giving a reason? Should there be a reason? In general, opinions have changed which is why the amendments are worth serious Government consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past 50 years, it has generally been accepted that a doctor should not have to give a reason for not wanting a patient on his list. If a relationship breaks down, it has been considered to be better not to go into it or to give reasons, as that could colour the willingness of another doctor to take the patient on. By and large, doctors have not refused patients in rural areas because they know that there is no choice and that the next nearest doctor might be 20 miles away. Common sense has prevailed. Why has that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0553">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>163</span>
changed and why is the amendment now worthy of serious consideration?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason is that doctors now are, perhaps, far more commercially driven. They might be fundholders with cash-limited instead of non-cash-limited drugs budgets, which means that they might have reasons not to take patients who have a high drug dependency—for example, people on Interferon being treated for cancer or those having expensive anti-AIDS treatments. If patients think that a doctor wants to get rid of them for a financial reason, should the doctor have to state that that is so—that the person is very expensive and is making an excessive call on the doctor's limited budget for drugs and hospital treatment? That causes problems because there may be restrictions on the doctor's ability to ask a patient to leave his list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies with dentistry, which does not have the same universal coverage as medical practices. There is no obligation on dentists to accept someone on to their list. All Committee members recognise that dentistry must approximate in one way or another to the same universal coverage as medicine. Despite the Government's boast that NHS dentistry has expanded, there is still a problem. I suspect that even they recognise that the expansion of NHS dentistry is very patchy and that it is difficult for fee-paying adults to obtain NHS dentistry in vast swathes of the country. It is in the interests of NHS consumers to clarify the relationship, which the amendments would do. They would make it a matter of public policy for general dental practitioners and general medical practitioners to think more seriously about their obligations in the new climate of the NHS, of which they are a part. They are cogs in the wheel of the provision of universal coverage of medical or dental primary health care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill is eventually enacted, we shall move into an exciting new era that involves pilot schemes providing dental and medical services, but more safeguards are needed. The amendments would provide them for people needing NHS dentistry, which has been extensively withdrawn, or NHS medical care. Could a pilot go ahead in an area that has a select population of patients who are easy and cheap to treat? Other people might say, "That scheme is not in my interest. How come I am being left out of this exciting pilot?" That person might happen to have an expensive condition to treat, which would put burdens on his doctor through repeat house calls or night calls or expensive drug provision—if the GP is a fund holder—which might include Interferon or the various treatments for AIDS. I hope that the amendments will establish how the Government intend to ensure that patients as consumers will be given the rights that people probably always thought that they had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All Committee members know, through our constituency surgery experience, that there is much more tension between patients and doctors or dentists than there used to be. When I came into the House 10 years ago, it was rare for patients who had been asked
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
to leave a doctor's list to accuse the doctor of removing them for financial reasons, but that is not uncommon today. People commonly say to me, "My child has been ill frequently this winter, and I have had about about 10 house calls. Now the practice wants me to leave the doctor's list." We know that the only reason is the money that is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such matters are poisoning the relationship between patients and doctors. The safeguards that the amendments contain would neutralise the poison and strengthen the belief among patients as consumers that they have rights and that doctors will not exploit in a one-sided manner the traditional right to ask someone to leave their list without giving a reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should strengthen access to NHS dentistry. For some people, a dentist's surgery may be 40 miles away. For example, in Pembrokeshire in west Wales, four people had to hire a minibus to travel 40 miles to the nearest NHS dentist in Fishguard. They all got seen, got back in the minibus and went home again. That was never what was envisaged for universal primary health care when the NHS started. We and the Government are talking about an NHS that is primary-healthcare led, yet people are making minibus journeys of 40 miles across a Welsh county to find that health care. That makes people feel that we have a primary-healthcare-withdrawing NHS, not one that is primary-healthcare led. That is already happening with dentistry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consumers and organisations that represent them feel that their rights need to be strengthened. The Government need seriously to consider how to undo some of the side-effects of the changes since 1990 with the new GP contract: the breakdown of negotiations between dentists and the Government in the mid-1990s, and GP fundholding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's provisions could also increase patients' fears that they are not getting a fair crack of the whip and are being taken off lists without explanation—although they suspect that money is behind it all. In reality when someone ceases to be on a doctor's list, we are talking about the breakdown of the doctor-patient relationship. If people can be assured that money is not causing doctors to remove them from the lists, they would be reassured about doctor-patient and dentist-patient relationships. However, dangers have occurred largely since but not entirely because of the 1990 contract and the breakdown of the dentist contract negotiations in the early 1990s. There are far greater tensions in dentists' and doctors' surgeries when someone is removed from the list now than there were when I became a Member of Parliament in 1987.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not accept the amendments, will the Minister explain how the Government intend to remove that increasing tension in the relationship over the issue of which list a patient is on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Tony Wright 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for missing the first few minutes of our proceedings. I want to speak briefly about amendment No. 115, which deals with the removal of patients from GPs' lists and to which, I hope, the Government

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>165</span>
will respond sympathetically, because it deals with a long-standing issue. The Bill provides us with an opportunity to correct an anomaly in current arrangements. I have thought that this should he done for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many years ago, when I had a proper job, among other things I used to chair a community health council. That was when I first became aware of a series of difficulties and anomalies arising from GPs' independent-contractor status. For example, it was impossible to discover how many GPs had had complaints upheld against them. It seemed reasonable that in asking patients to select their GPs it was a matter of public interest to know whether they had had a string of complaints upheld against them by the relevant service committee. However, that information was confidential and so patients were, in a sense, choosing in the dark. I thought that that was indefensible because, although there should be no public interest in knowing of unsubstantiated complaints, patients should know about complaints upheld. Complaints about hospital services are now published—and quite right too. That means that we can judge specific hospitals and trust specific centres on that index amongst others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue that I am discussing now is similar. It seemed unfair to me that GPs could remove people seemingly arbitrarily from their lists without having to give reasons and without any means of appeal—because they were operating as independent contractors and could do what they liked. Nothing in their contracts said that they had to give reasons for their actions. Once they had decided that a relationship had broken down they could simply announce it to the family health services authority or the health authority, as it is now, and the patient would be removed from a list. Is that a satisfactory arrangement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was during the past few years, when many people came to me as a Member of Parliament saying that they had been removed from doctors' lists, that I began to take a renewed interest in the matter. Some cases were apparently indefensible given the nature of the family or illnesses described. Whole families had been removed because of incidents that happened with one family member. On the basis of that evidence I went to what was then the FHSA in Staffordshire and said, "Will you tell me about the removal patterns of general practitioners in my area?" The first response was that that was confidential information and was not to be disclosed. After further discussion, it provided a list showing the removal pattern of patients which revealed that my area had nearly the highest number of removals in the county, second only to an area of Stoke-on-Trent. The most difficult areas in social, economic and health terms had the highest level of removals from GPs' lists. The evidence also showed enormous variations between GPs. Some were removing quite readily and some were removing hardly at all, but none had to give reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of my interest, the FHSA discussed the matter with some of the heavily-removing practices. It
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
was kind enough to write to me saying that perhaps because of my interest the removal rate in some of those practices had declined in the following year. But that is not the way to improve a system which presents many different problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had an especially difficult constituency case a year or two ago involving Mr. Dylan Jones who suffered severe mental illness and who had spent years of his life alternating between mental hospital and prison. In desperation, I wrote to every conceivable authority about him. His mother constantly came to see me to tell me that either he was going to kill someone or he was going to kill himself. He was not being supported properly in the community and, as he was under no continuing GP care, drugs were being prescribed for him in a reckless way. In October 1995, a consultant psychiatrist and others, as a result of requests made by myself and others, went to visit him but he had just killed himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That case, to which I referred on Second Reading, was reviewed by the relevant trust. It recognised that he was an extremely vulnerable person who was not receiving continuing GP care because he was on a three-month rotation. GPs did not know him—they did not want to know him. He was sitting on excessive and inappropriate prescriptions which allowed him to do things to himself that he would not otherwise have been able to do. The review concluded that for an extremely vulnerable person with a high dependency, the lack of contining GP care was the prime factor in causing his death. It drew attention to the need to review the problem. The Bill enables us to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked at the British Medical Association's advice to general practitioners on this, last issued in 1994. It says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The GMSC's guidance recommends that GPs should consider writing to patients who are removed from their lists, to explain the reasons for the removal. It is a matter of common courtesy to do so, and explanation will avoid any misunderstanding of a doctor's motives."</p></blockquote>
Well, I commend that, but the fact is that doctors do not have to do that and routinely do not. They do not provide reasons for removal and, if reasons are given, they are not open to challenge. We have to decide whether that is acceptable. I do not think it is; it is arbitrary and many GPs would accept the need for a different regime. I hope that the GPs who will operate under the Bill's provisions will adopt a different regime but, in the Bill, we can finally correct that anomaly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are only asking for reasons to be given and for some right of appeal. The amendment would not end the right of doctors to remove patients from their lists; it simply suggests a process that they should go through beforehand. I hope that the Government will respond positively to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to add a brief point to the debate. In my experience, the problems relating to GPs are different from those relating to dentists because, as yet, there is not a pronounced shortage of GPs. I believe that it is often in the GPs' interest to give reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A constituent wrote to me because she wished to change her GP. She changed doctor and, shortly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0555">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>167</span>
afterwards, wrote to me again with the same request. She went through a third and then a fourth GP practice, and the fourth practice she approached happened to be the one that I use myself. After a short while, she wanted to change practice again, which was entirely acceptable to the practice. However, because it was also my practice, I inquired why that lady was constantly on the move, and why the move was sometimes initiated by her and sometimes by the GP. It turned out that her behaviour was clearly unreasonable because she would call whichever GP she was registered with at all hours of the day and night, and request home visits when they were clearly unnecessary. After a while, when the doctor would not visit her at home, she would ask to be moved or the GP would ask her to move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That lady clearly had a mental problem. GPs had advised her that she should see someone at a higher level, but she refused to accept that she had a problem. That situation went on for many years without the lady having any knowledge of why GPs seemed to be behaving unreasonably in keeping her off their lists. The reason was that her behaviour was unreasonable. Having written to her to explain why I no longer felt able to request that she be transferred again, she clearly thought that she also had an unreasonable Member of Parliament and she told me that her last GP was a disgraceful schmuck, so I got some idea of the difficulties that she caused.

I believe that it would often be in a GP's interests to give a reason. In the sort of case mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Dr. Wright), the amendment would be helpful in protecting the patient because the GP would have to give a logical reason. The reason often suggested—that someone is registered with a fundholding GP who does not want the excessive cost—would not be acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should assert the right to be registered with a dentist also. I go to a dentist who was part of a joint practice. When changes were made in the way in which dentists are paid, his partner decided that he no longer wanted NHS patients. My dentist was thrown out of the practice because his partner did not even want NHS patients on the premises. When people discovered that that dentist was no longer willing to treat NHS patients, some of them found it difficult to find another dentist in the area. We should assert the right of people to have NHS dentistry. That would not solve the problem, but it must be part of the provision to which citizens have a right as part of the NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mr. Gerald Malone)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to respond to a debate on an important aspect of the NHS—the doctor-patient relationship. Perhaps it would be helpful to the Committee if I were to put the problem into perspective. The number of people who are removed from a GP's list each year represents only 0.15 per cent. of those on the patient list. That is a very small average percentage. What is more, there may be a number of reasons for patients being removed from a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
list. When someone moves, the GP may request that the patient be removed from the list, or a patient may die and be removed from the list.

I am not pooh-poohing the arguments, but putting them in context. I recognise that the matter is important for each individual patient and it is quite right that the Committee should consider the matter, as shown by the Government amendments extending the right to choose a medical and dental practitioner with the new services that will be available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister whether the 0.15 per cent. has been a stable figure or whether it has drifted upwards, as I suspect from anecdotal evidence from constituency surgery casework.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the basis suggested by the hon. Gentleman that the figure must have drifted upwards according to his casework, the figure is still very low and not one on which a noticeable trend could he spotted. If the trend were upward over a period, it would be a matter of concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be absolutely clear about the figures. I discovered that the figures in my area were out of variance with the national figure. Indeed, the figures supplied to me in relation to Staffordshire suggested that the highest incidence, at 0.577 per cent., was in north Stoke, followed closely by Cannock at 0.557 per cent. There was a significant variance between Cannock and the next area, which was south Staffordshire. Between 1992 and 1994, there were 385 removals in Cannock with a huge variation among practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister can produce an overall figure of 0.15 per cent., I am discussing an example where the figure is 0.557 per cent. That is a significant figure and relates to many patients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but I am not sure whether his figure includes the three components that I mentioned—perhaps he can enlighten me. Patients can be removed by the doctor at the doctor's request for a range of reasons, not simply because the doctor no longer wants to treat them. The other two categories are that patients have moved away and perhaps neglected to set their records in order, or that they have died. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman knows whether the figures that he quoted from his health authority account for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand that to take the global figures is misleading because they cover normal removals. I am discussing patients who are

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
removed from doctors' lists for other reasons. I asked that my health authority explore the reasons that were given. Typical reasons from high strike-off practices were; failure to attend hospital appointments or follow medical advice, persistent demands for unnecessary home visits, and demands for sick notes or for exemption from jury service. We could discuss whether such reasons should legitimately enable doctors to remove some of the most difficult patients from their lists in some of the most stressed areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not entirely certain whether such reasons apply to the whole figure mentioned by the hon. Gentleman or to a proportion of it. If the hon. Gentleman is concerned about the issue, perhaps he could write to me about it with the detailed figure and I will examine it. Clearly, if an unusual trend is being exhibited, we should be concerned about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can provide the figure for the trend over time in absolute numbers: in 1992–93, the figure was 78,900; it rose in 1995–96 to 82,139. A small increase has occurred in the overall figures, but I have not yet been able to extrapolate from that a trend over time in percentages—I have not brought my calculator with me. However, when considered against the increase in GP principals that has taken place over a similar period, I suggest that perhaps the hon. Gentleman could accept that the figure is relatively stable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah no. The important comparison would be with the time before the GP contract came into force in 1990. I do not know whether it is possible to find the figures from 1989 to the present day—they would probably be more significant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot provide those figures at present. If the hon. Gentleman wants to persist, doubtless he will do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it would be helpful if I set on the record the very important basis on which the doctor-patient relationship relies. That is what the Government amendments aim to extend into the new arrangements. The relationship is highly personal, so it has always been felt best that there be a balance, on both sides, as the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) rightly remarked in his opening remarks, about whether to maintain the relationship. If patients decide, for whatever reason, that a doctor is no longer for them, they have a positive right to be registered somewhere else. Similarly, if doctors feel unable to treat a patient any longer, they are no longer obliged to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real issue for the Committee is to explore whether the arrangement can be abused by doctors—that was the gist of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Cardiff, West. We must consider whether the system to control any potential abuse should be set in primary legislation or whether it should be dealt with in other ways. The medical profession takes that matter extremely seriously, and it always has done. Guidance issued by the General Medical Council in 1992 makes it crystal clear that it is unacceptable to discriminate against patients on the grounds of age, sex, sexuality, race, colour, beliefs, perceived
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>170</span>
Economic worth—a point that has been touched on repeatedly this morning—and the amount of work that is likely to be generated by a person's clinical condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The GMC is the profession's regulatory authority and it has a range of sanctions that it can take against a doctor who acts in a manner that it considers to be unacceptable. If there were evidence that a doctor had, for example, removed a patient purely on the grounds of economic worth, the GMC would take action that would bring the GP before the professional misconduct committee or the pre-proceedings committee. The GMC's sanctions are heavy: the ultimate sanction is the removal of the doctor's registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, West argued earlier this morning that the Bill should contain provisions stating that a doctor should declare whether a patient was removed for economic reasons. If we did that, doctors—knowing that they would incur the GMC's sanctions—would not be likely to declare that that was their reason. Acceding to his suggestion would not get us very far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The General Medical Services Committee of the BMA has issued several commonsense recommendations to GPs. For example it said that they should consider sending a brief letter to patients who are being removed from lists informing them of that fact and outlining the reasons why that action had been taken. That is common sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we debate the theory of such matters, it is important for Committee members to appreciate the fact that the doctor-patient relationship, which exists in a practical and often difficult world, may break down in ways that make it unreasonable to restrict the freedom of either party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly believe—on the basis of discussions that I have had over a considerable period with professionals, patients and those who use the service—that using legislation to require reasons to be given could act as a smokescreen behind which those wishing to depart from a relationship could hide. That would be unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) made an important point about vulnerable people, especially those who suffer from mental health problems. In light of the Ritchie report, which studied such matters, it was recommended that when a patient has, or might have, a mental illness, it is essential that his or her needs are specifically dealt with before removal from a GP's list is considered. I am glad that he raised that matter as it gives me the opportunity to state that, although I do not think that it would be proper to deal with that matter in primary legislation, it is important to realise that we, the medical profession and the relevant service have recognised the potential difficulties that may arise. There is—and always has been—a method to tackle the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of dentists was mentioned. Amendments Nos. 79 and 80 are analogous to the amendments relating to GPs. They would prevent dentists from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0557">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>171</span>
refusing to accept patients without reasonable grounds and require regulations to be made compelling dentists to give their reasons for refusing to treat a patient. The same reasons that I advanced in relation to GPs also apply to dentists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If amendments Nos. 81 and 82 were accepted they would give the Secretary of State a new power to arrange for the distribution of patients unable to obtain dental treatment among various dentists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To use the Secretary of State as a patient distribution system for the dental profession, with the result that patients turn up, unwanted, at dentists' surgeries, would not be the best way of establishing a sound basis on which to carry forward the new and innovative arrangements in the Bill. I am not at all convinced that statutory provision is necessary. We need powers to put in place salaried dentist schemes for those who are unable to receive treatment elsewhere—the sort of initiatives that we introduced following out listening exercise—and powers to provide access funds, so that patients who are unable to gain access to dentists have facilities to do so. We also need the co-operation of the dentistry profession, without which everything is meaningless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have persuaded the Committee that we do not need to include such obligations in the Bill, although they are taken seriously by Government and by the professions, who have concern for the delicate issues raised by Opposition Members. In the light of what I have said, I hope that the amendments will not be pressed to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been one of our most evenhanded debates, with the least disagreement between the two sides of the Committee. In his response, the Minister accepted what we said in its fundamental form—namely, that there was a problem in allaying patients' fears about why they had been removed from the list and whether the decision was fair. From our experience as Members of Parliament, we all know that somewhere in the patient's mind is the thought that he or she has been removed for reasons that benefit the doctor, that the system is loaded against the patient, and that it is too easy for the doctor to remove a patient without reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept what the Minister said, namely, that we do not want to initiate anything that will require doctors to incriminate themselves and land them in front of the GMC for unprofessional behaviour—for example, for removing a patient who happens to have a high drug cost and whom it economically benefits the doctor to remove. We do not want to include any measure in the Bill that could cause doctors to lie in order to avoid self-incrimination, or to incriminate themselves by admitting that they have removed the patient for an economic reason. That would be absurd. But we all agree that there is a problem and we need to find the right vehicle for solving the range of problems that have been referred to in this morning's debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers are also Members of Parliament with constituencies and I am sure that there are vast
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
quantities of correspondence in the Department of Health on how to strike the right balance between the rights of patients and the rights of doctors—and dentists too, where appropriate—to preserve, in its best possible form, the patient-doctor relationship. That relationship was at its best in the period up to 1990 when the new NHS GP contract was introduced, along with care in the community, which has posed additional problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give notice to the Committee that we shall seek leave to withdraw the amendments so as to give us more time to think of the right solution to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Care in the community, which is one of the major developments of the past seven years, undoubtedly poses problems of the sort mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood. He specifically referred to the three-month rota. In Cardiff, we have a six-month scheme for people suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, under which GPs agree to take on a patient for six months. They know that it will mean trouble; they know that such patients demand drugs and threaten to kill themselves, or the doctor, but the GP agrees that for six months he or she will take on the burden of looking after a patient and, after six months, the patient is handed over to the next doctor. That is not in the best interests of the patients because they need continuity of responsibility, which is at the heart of the list system in primary health care, but it is all that doctors can cope with. They may get someone else's schizophrenic patient and pass one of their own, whom they may have looked after for the past six months, to another GP. One way or another, they feel that the burden is shared among all GPs. It is an informal system and not very good, but it is the best that we have come up with so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can we solve that problem, which is one of the unintended side effects of care in the community, and which will now be dealt with at primary health care level in rural areas? It may be reasonable for patients to be taken off a list in suburbia or an inner-city area where there are other general practitioners, but what about remote rural areas?

A famous case in Presteigne on the Welsh-English border three or four years ago affected patients in England as well as Wales. Vaccination and immunisation targets in the primary health care contract could not be met because a large number of patients led an alternative lifestyle and did not believe in vaccination and immunisation for their children. As a result, the GP lost the 5 per cent. or whatever it was of his contract for not reaching the 90 per cent. target for vaccination and immunisation. He could not reach that target because some of his patients were conscientious objectors to vaccination and immunisation. He told those patients that they must leave his list because otherwise he would lose money. That raised an issue of ethics. He could not persuade them to have their children vaccinated and immunised and it was their free choice to make that decision.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>173</span>
I know of family health services authority directors in Wales who told GPs that if a certain patient was removed from their list, the authority would put that patient back on the list. Health authorities have the right to force doctors to take a patient back, usually for six months, after which the GP tries again to remove the patient from his list. In rural areas there is no real choice and the patient must remain on the list. How can we solve that problem in rural areas where there is no choice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem in rural areas is the high cost of drug therapy for cancer with expensive drugs such as Interferon, Retrovir and so on. I think we all agree that there is a problem. We must get the balance right so that patients do not think that doctors have it all their own way and can remove patients from their list for economic reasons. We must allow lists to be run on a basis of trust and understanding between the doctor and the patient. The relationship is triangular because reasons are usually given to the family health services authority, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood said, but are often not given to the patient. In some circumstances that may be right, because the reason may be actionable. All sorts of problems arise in that triangular relationship. Now that we are moving towards pilot projects such as those on which the Bill is based, I appeal to the Government to try to solve the problems in the doctor-patient relationship—the Opposition will try to do so—in the new NHS without creating a problem of self-incrimination and without interfering with the relationship with the General Medical Council, which is the policeman of professional standards for the primary health care professions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems in dentistry are slightly different. The Minister realises that people perceive, rightly or wrongly, that provision of universal primary health care in dentistry is now patchy. The Government devised the residual fall-back service to solve a problem of their own making. It is something of a two-tier service, which is not an exciting prospect for the new millennium. If, after further consideration, we can solve the problem in the best problem-solving traditions of western democracy, we shall all be happy.

dispensing practice and the responsibilities of pharmacists to ensure national standards. Opposition Members recognise the importance of retaining national standards in the large number of local pilots. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society sets national standards and is rightly concerned that the Bill may allow a health authority to contract for a specific additional pharmaceutical service with different contractors, with resulting variations in standards of pharmaceutical practice. It is vital that the Bill incorporates a mechanism to ensure that national standards are maintained throughout the pilots. That is the purpose of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second amendment is more technical, but it, too, is important. Without it, the Secretary of State will be free to set out unspecified additional prescribed circumstances which may require doctors to be removed from the dispensing list, possibly depriving patients of a necessary and valued service. Only dispensing doctors found by the NHS tribunal to be incompetent should, we believe, be stopped from providing a dispensing service to their patients. There should be no question of granting the Secretary of State the power to curtail patient access to those services for unspecified reasons. Removal only after an NHS tribunal hearing would be sufficient to ensure patient safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that the hon. Lady regards these as probing amendments. She is right to point out the concerns that have been raised by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. I am perfectly prepared to satisfy those concerns by answering her in two ways. The hon. Lady and the profession have raised concerns about professional standards. Those services will be provided by professional people. The same argument applies to quality under the new arrangements as applies under any current arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 83 and 85 aim to ensure that directions given to health authorities or boards do not cut across professional standards already extant within the pharmacy profession. It would be not only unusual but downright perverse for that to be the case. The hon. Lady and the profession are seeking a firm commitment from me that, before making such directions, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will consider any existing code of practice. He would not wish to undermine professional standards in the way contemplated. If that were attempted, the professionals would not bring themselves into conflict with professional standards with which they would naturally wish to comply. Although we want health authorities or boards to have flexibility about how much of a service to purchase and about the features that it contains, I assure the hon. Lady that my right

hon. Friend the Secretary of State would have in mind professional standards when considering how to issue directions for additional pharmaceutical services.

The purpose of the Bill—and the tenor of our debate so far—is to build on the quality of services. It would be not a little perverse to do things the other way round. I suggest to the hon.

The principal purpose of the clause is to ensure that all dispensing doctors, including those who in future elect to provide personal medical services under part I arrangements, will be subject as far as their dispensing activities are concerned to the NHS tribunal arrangements. The important mechanism by which that can be provided is dispensing lists which will apply to all medical practitioners providing pharmaceutical services. The tribunal deals with removal from the list on disciplinary grounds, but we also need provision to deal with the limited range of non-disciplinary circumstances, some of which are obvious. I give the hon. Lady two examples: a dispensing doctor who dies or one who decides to withdraw from providing the service, which would lead to his or her removal from the list. I point out to the hon. Lady that health authorities already operate similar provisions for pharmaceutical and medical lists.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments require all appointments to a medical list to go through the Medical Practices Committee, as happens at present. We are concerned that the Government seem happy for health authorities to make appointments to the list. The MPC believes that health authorities do not have all the expertise to do that and argue that they do not make other medical appointments to NHS trusts. A few health authorities have already suggested that, if that function is delegated to them, they will ask the MPC to act as their agent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remember that, on Second Reading, the Secretary of State made it clear that the position of the MPC within the existing red book contract would be completely unchanged by the Bill's provisions. We do not believe that that very clear position can be sustained without the Committee's acceptance of amendments Nos. 89 and 90.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
The Government have given a number of reasons for devolving that power to health authorities, and too much bureaucracy is one of them. However, we argue that the system is much less bureaucratic when conducted by a central body rather than individual health authorities. It is important to remember the extremely good reputation of the MPC for the thoroughness of its checks, which are made before GPs are admitted to medical lists. During our proceedings earlier this week, I reminded the Committee that, since 1948, only one bogus doctor has ever got through the rigorous scrutiny of the MPC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another question concerns the additional costs for which health authorities would be liable and which would be incurred as a result of taking on those additional management tasks. We know that they are already stretched and if it ain't broke, why fix it? I shall listen carefully to the Minister's justification for the reorganisation, which worries the Medical Practices Committee in its pursuit of representing the interests of GPs and patients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for so clearly setting out her concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Atkinson) should not gossip across the Public Gallery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Alan, for protecting me from background activities that might otherwise have been distracting. I am extremely grateful for that powerful chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady clearly and rightly set out her concern. The excellent record of general practice in ensuring that only properly qualified people are admitted to it is not something that the Government would undermine. As I said earlier, although the MPC has a checking role in all such matters, a substantial amount of the information on which it bases its conclusions is supplied by health authorities. They are important repositories of the information needed before decisions on general practitioners, their qualifications and so one can be made. We need not fear the loss of expertise and in-depth knowledge of necessary qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause should be considered as part of the process that it and clause 30 will establish. It will provide a fair system which will place clear responsibilities on health authorities while recognising the continuing and important role of the MPC. We intend to establish a sound legislative base for the appointment of general practitioners to provide general medical services. That is the principle on which the two clauses are based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Problems with current legislation have been widely recognised. It works unambiguously only where a general medical practitioner applies for a single-handed vacancy. It does not deal properly with the appointment of partners. Custom and practice have grown around the appointments process, which has made it unduly bureaucratic. The argument that that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>179</span>
needs sorting out has been made vigorously to ministers. The combination of clauses 29 and 30 does just that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments, however, would secure a role for the MPC beyond that which is required of it to fulfil its existing statutory function relating to the distribution of general medical practitioners. What is useful about the proposed series of changes to primary legislation governing such matters is that it enhances the proper role of the MPC. As I explained, the MPC will work with the resource allocation group under part I arrangements when considering distributional matters—its raison d'être—and perhaps will cut out unnecessary bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Control of entry to the medical lists of health authorities should fall to the authority itself. Amendments Nos. 89 and 90 would prevent that. The hon. Lady raised an important point about unnecessary bureaucracy. The two amendments would require a bureaucratic system whereby, having agreed with the MPC that a vacancy exists, and having filled the vacancy, health authorities would have to go back to the MPC for approval of the selected candidate before he or she could be entered on the list for general medical services. I firmly believe that approval of the general practitioner for inclusion in the health authority's medical list should be the responsibility of the health authority. I also suggest that the appointment of partners should be a matter for the existing partnership once the MPC has agreed that a vacancy exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3, 12 and 4 are similar in that they provide that, following the enactment of the Bill, the Secretary of State must lay regulations to the effect that the MPC will retain its current role, despite the fact that that does not sit happily either with general practice as it is today or with the role of health authorities. Therefore, I cannot support the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 13 is somewhat puzzling. It deals with the process of variation or revocation of decisions, including appeals to the Secretary of State. It would also amend only those provisions that relate to Scotland and not those relating to England. The amendment would remove the regulatory power to provide for variation or revocation of decisions by health boards and the MPC, as well as the right of appeal to the Secretary of State on points of law in relation to the filling of vacancies. I suggest that it is a probing amendment to examine the general matters that we have been debating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some sensible changes to this and the following clause have been requested by those who consider such matters. We are putting in place a new system that is welcomed, and some of the hon. Lady's concerns have been met. A less bureaucratic system in respect of these appointments—because, after all, the health authority should have ultimate custody of whoever is admitted to its list—is a more sensible way of proceeding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that both the MPC and the BMA will take the Minister's remarks as a breach of the understanding created by the Secretary of State's remarks on Second Reading. However, the Minister's response to the amendments is utterly consistent with what he has said in response to earlier debates in Committee, which were essentially about deregulation and the dispersal of a national framework. That causes us great concern. I am sure that, in view of our grave doubts about the Government's proposals on this aspect of regulation, we shall return to the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The wording of the Bill seems to confuse single-handed vacancies and vacancies in GP partnerships.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me explain the purpose of the amendments. I shall go through them in detail so that it is on the record for anyone who is in doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 153 and 154, along with their Scottish counterparts, amendments Nos. 155 and 156, make it clear that health authorities will nominate doctors to fill sole practitioner vacancies and will approve doctors to fill partnership vacancies. That reflects the policy, which will be enshrined in regulations, that candidates for GP partnerships should be selected by the practice. That important principle will be upheld by the amendments, which were tabled in response to concerns that were expressed by the profession and which I mentioned earlier.

Amendment No. 140 is a drafting amendment to section 3 of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978. It is consequential to the introduction of clause 30. Clause 30 introduces a new method of filling GP vacancies and the amendment will remove the role of the Scottish Medical Practices Committee in deciding who is to fill such vacancies. I hope that putting that matter clearly on the record satisfies the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment will set a maximum period of eight years from the introduction of part I, during which time pilot schemes can be proposed and conducted. The Opposition welcome the opportunity for innovation and diversity that pilots offer, but we believe that it would be risky to allow the pilot phase to continue indefinitely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Government want to learn from the experience of pilots and to apply that to the permanent arrangement and the organisation of services. Pilots are by definition a temporary, short-term way of exploring new ways of developing and delivering services. The Bill should therefore set an end date. We want the sun to set on piloting eight years after the Bill is enacted. There would be no new pilots after five years, which would allow their three-year life to run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
New Clause 13 was debated in another place. It would require an annual report about the progress of pilot schemes to be given to Parliament. That brings us back to the rather unsatisfactory conclusion to our debate earlier this week about the evaluation of pilots. This is, as it were, a stepped-down version of the evaluation for which we argued. At the very least, in order to maintain a national framework of these important developments in primary care, Parliament should have an opportunity annually to consider lessons learned from pilots, the failures and signs for the future. I hope that in responding to the two amendments the Minister will be rather more generous than his colleague was in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I am doomed to disappoint on the amendments. I have colloquially named them the end-of-history amendments, because under them primary care evolution would end not after eight years but after five years. That would be the maximum of a pilot scheme, if it were to be assessed within the three-year maximum period that we have agreed. I am not sure why the hon. Lady believes that the evolution of primary care will have been set in stone at the end of that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems that we have faced in the delivery of primary care is a rigid system that has delivered that care well but often against the odds, and the inflexibilities of the primary legislation. We have delivered that care, against the odds, for a number of years and that was the genesis of the process. It is an important point to make for two reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we need always to be able to assess new models of delivery of primary care. Secondly, during this debate, the Opposition have welcomed the fact that the model of care that we propose includes the possibility to pilot changes. They contrasted that with other changes in the health service in recent years. I ask the hon. Lady to consider the implications of her amendment. It would end the piloting process so that it would not be possible to accommodate the evolutionary changes that will take place, which neither she nor I—not even the medical professions—can contemplate during the next five years. If we look back in five years at what has happened in primary care during the previous five years, our only suggestion may be that we should not make too many rigid plans for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Lady considers that, I hope that she will accept that if change continues to take place in primary care, it is important to ensure that it is possible to pilot those changes with all the safeguards in the primary legislation. Having welcomed the fact that we now have an entirely different process for evaluating change in a more accountable way, it would be perverse to throw that out after five years and impose more rigidity in the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to new clause 13, I would like to reiterate that we are committed to an open consultative process and wish to ensure that all those who have an interest are kept in touch with developments. However, as my noble Friend Baroness Cumberlege said in another place, we believe that a system of annual reports to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0563">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
Parliament would be out of proportion with other scrutiny arrangements, inappropriate and unjustified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady and I are aware that there are a number of well-established mechanisms. I simply set them out for the record; I do not suggest that she is in ignorance of them. They include Select Committee inquiries, parliamentary questions and debates. They all provide regular opportunities to call for information in Parliament and that is the best way of ensuring a continuing flow of information about what is happening in this sector of the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an organisation as large and diverse as the NHS, service development is constantly under way, not just in primary care but in a range of other areas. There is not much logic in selecting primary care and part I arrangements, especially for an annual report to Parliament, if one does not also consider what is happening elsewhere in terms of innovation in the acute sector. Unless we are to bind ourselves illogically to reporting on one element of NHS care, we will be faced with a gamut of annual reports on a series of changes that are taking place throughout the NHS, which would be pointless. I suggest that the amendments are undesirable and would produce a result that no one would welcome in the long term. Of course individual pilots must have a life span but we have guaranteed that by an amendment agreed to earlier in our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly suggest that we have sufficiently firm scrutiny procedures to cover the whole range of activities taking place in our national health service. There is no need to place yet another obligation on the service—for an annual report on only one important part of it—and to enshrine it in primary legislation. I hope that the hon. Lady will see fit to withdraw the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is important about the Minister's remarks is that they show that it is not the Government's intention that there should be a permanent process of change and development in primary care. Once that has been clarified, it seems to me that the term "pilot" ceases to be an appropriate description of the process. The Minister has made it clear that he intends there to be a perpetual revolution. We argue that, while embracing all the opportunities of innovation, learning from experience and new development, the success of discovering an approach to primary care that works well must be disseminated as widely as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By no stretch of the imagination, do any of the other mechanisms mentioned by the Minister, except perhaps the Select Committee mechanism—although Select Committees make their own decisions about inquiries—adequately fulfil that task. An annual report to Parliament is not only for the benefit of Members of Parliament; it records in one place the experience of what works and what fails, and is an assessment of the possibilities for future development. That is of benefit to the health service and to its patients generally. We believe that in not supporting
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
the proposal for an annual report, the Minister is missing an important opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Hendry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(High Peak)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By requiring too much in the way of interim reporting, might not one give greater attention to areas that have not so far worked well but which may work in the long run? If we had asked Alexander Fleming to give an annual report to Parliament on his research into penicillin, for several years, he would have said, "No progress". Then, one year, he would have said, "Bingo, found it". In giving greater attention to ideas that have not yet worked, one might create too pessimistic a view of the long-term potential for success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

At every stage of launching on this new and, as yet, uncharted journey, of personal medical services through pilots, there are lessons to be learnt. I remain firmly of the opinion that, if the Bill is not amended, in three or four years, this will be seen as a wasted opportunity. It is a pity that, given the Minister's limited ability to be open-minded towards several amendments—perhaps a door ajar rather than fully open—he does not see fit to accept this one. I hope that we shall have an opportunity to return to the matter either in this Parliament or in the next. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take new clause 8—	<i>International exchanges in general practice (No. 2)</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>".In the 1978 Act, in section 19 after subsection (2)(g) insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(h) for the circumstances in which a medical practitioner who is not suitably experienced within the meaning of section 21 or who does not have an acquired right prescribed or otherwise provided for by regulations may provide general medical services.'.".</p></blockquote></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clauses would permit the Secretary of State to introduce regulations to enable non-European economic area doctors, who are fully qualified in their own countries, to be involved in international exchanges. They would visit the United Kingdom for short periods to learn from the experience of working in a general practice and possibly to contribute to the education of UK undergraduates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that negotiations with the Department of Health on that matter have been taking place for two years without any success. The Bill offers a useful opportunity in which to give the Secretary of State the power to introduce regulations to facilitate international exchanges. That would enable visiting GPs from outside the EEA to be issued with time-limited certificates, so that they can work as supervised deputies in a named practice and assist with the provision of general medical services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suitably experienced doctors, including visiting professors or GPs from, for example, New Zealand and Australia should be able to visit the UK for short periods of time—usually at most a year—to work in general practice. The Joint Committee on Postgraduate Training for General Practice—hereafter to be known as the JCPTGP—does not issue UK certificates to non-EEA doctors unless they have spent a period of training in the UK. Non-EEA doctors may currently enter general practice in the UK only if they have been awarded a certificate of prescribed or equivalent experience by the JCPTGP or if they hold an acquired right, which I shall not explain, because I am sure that the Minister knows what that is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been told that the Government believe that existing legislation allows international exchanges to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>187</span>
take place where the JCPTGP considers non-EEA doctors' experience to be equivalent to that prescribed for domestic GPs and that all that is necessary is to amend the NHS vocational training regulations. Legal advice given to the BMA, however, is that it is not sufficient to amend the regulations and that primary legislation is needed. The JCPTGP does not believe that it is proper to issue certificates that suggest that a person is capable of independent practice as an NHS general practitioner to a doctor who lacks prior experience of general practice within the UK. It seems right that the JCPTGP should have the power to approve exchange doctors in restricted circumstances, namely, when they work in a named practice or practices under supervision by a doctor in that practice or a neighbouring practice for a limited period that does not exceed one year. It is not the intention to give an exchange doctor the permanent right to practise as a doctor in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to have the opportunity to set on record the fact that we have no objection in principle to the suggestion that there should be international exchanges between doctors. Throughout the rather protracted discussions that we had with representatives of the profession about that matter, I always made my views clear. There is no difference of principle between me and the hon. Gentleman. The question is about the framework within which that should take place. We accept that such experience can be valuable to both practitioners taking part in the exchange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I contest the suggestion that the new clauses are necessary, the reason being that there is a competent authority, which was referred to ad longum and "in acronymous" by the hon. Gentleman, which I shall refer to as "the committee". That competent authority has the power to facilitate such exchanges but only where it considers the experience of non-EEA doctors to be equivalent to that required of domestic GPs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A simple question must be asked of those who wish to have a two-tier standard applying to practitioners working in general practice, as suggested by the hon. Gentleman. The committee may not want to accredit a doctor with a sufficient guarantee of quality that he or she could be a doctor permanently in this country, and it would not be in the interests of patients to create a second-strand GP. Before accepting the amendment, we should consider whether it would be sensible to allow exchange doctors to practise in the United Kingdom on the strength of a lesser requirement than is in place for a doctor qualified in this country. After lengthy discussions with representatives of the committee, I have decided to turn the matter back to them. Why should certification of a person's competency to treat be on two levels?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion of the time limit is also odd. Our important debate on the admission of people to general practice covered the need to ensure that they are properly and competently qualified. I thought that the health authority could do that for admission to its
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
list and perhaps the MPC could help. The Labour party said that that would not be enough because the MPC should have complete custody of such matters. The idea that a certificate of quality can be time expired so that a doctor is deemed to be sufficiently qualified to treat a patient on Tuesday but becomes insufficiently qualified to treat a patient on Wednesday is a curious notion. It stems from the fact that the competent authority is not allocating a period of time within which a doctor may practise in this country because the committee's basic function is to certify whether a doctor has the qualities to provide general practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I respectfully suggest to the Committee and the hon. Gentleman that the ball is firmly in the court of those who certify such matters. It would not be proper to include in legislation a time-limited qualification for a doctor which would mean that he or she could treat patients one day but not the next. That is an extraordinary proposition. I want this important issue resolved because everyone agrees that exchanges between doctors are a good thing. I believe, however, that the solution lies in the hands of the competent certifying authority rather than this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that such a complicated matter will not be resolved this morning. I was slightly surprised by some of the language used by the Minister. The people affected might be visiting professors. We are talking about highly qualified people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is exactly illustrated by that. Why cannot highly qualified and highly competent people simply be certified to treat patients? Let us say that those people are working in primary care and they happen not to leave the country. No matter how eminent they are, they become doctors whose qualifications in this country have expired by a particular date. The committee's purpose is not to impose time limits on qualifications but to decide whether a person is sufficiently qualified. The expiry date adds a bizarre element to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>New clause 12—	<i>Employment of medical practitioners</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in this Act shall preclude a Health Authority from employing directly a medical practitioner who provides personal medical services.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are important new clauses, which enable—but do not require—health authorities and boards to employ GPs on a salaried basis where suitably experienced doctors choose to participate. The aim is to achieve greater flexibility in arrangements for employing GPs, particularly in areas where recruitment has proved difficult—I highlight that as a reason for the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government object to the principle because they perceive a conflict of interest between health authorities or boards as purchasers and GPs as providers. Baroness Cumberlege expressed that objection in another place and, on Second Reading, the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am not in favour of amending the Bill to include that power. If the provision of the purchaser-provider split—I shall not use the emotionally charged phrase 'internal market' …—is to mean anything".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 February 1997; Vol. 290, c. 61.]</p></blockquote>
The purchaser-provider split is not the internal market. No doubt that will be thrown back at us by the Minister in his reply. However, just because we accept the purchaser-provider split does not mean we accept the internal market, which has to do with the specific relationships between purchasers and providers under the Government's model. That is probably why we prefer the word "commissioner" to "purchaser" because it highlights a difference in the relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several problems with the Government's objection. First, I submit that the contract for services—the traditional contract between the health
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
board and a GP—is not all that different from the contract of service suggested for GPs as employees of health boards. Secondly, more fundamentally, GPs are not only providers but purchasers. Perhaps the Minister can tell us in his reply whether the Government accept that. The Government seem to want the purchasing of secondary health care by health boards and authorities to decrease. The whole thrust of Government policy seems to be to make GPs purchasers of secondary care instead. Given that GPs are purchasers and providers, there is a far more striking disruption of the purchaser-provider split in the Government proposal that GPs should be employees of trusts. In that situation, which the Government accept, the purchaser and provider are identical. The Opposition find it incomprehensible, therefore, that the Government should be prepared to accept GPs as employees of trusts but not as employees of health boards. We are genuinely puzzled by that because, using the logic of the purchaser-provider split, there is a far more fundamental anomaly in GPs being employees of trusts than of health boards or authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is supposed to be an enabling piece of legislation, which will allow alternative methods of delivering personal medical services to be developed and evaluated. Ruling out the option of GPs being engaged as health authority and board employees at the outset, without piloting or evaluation, runs counter to the legislation's overall spirit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some GPs would like to experiment with salaried employment by authorities or boards and it is unduly restrictive to require that salaried status can be achieved only through working for other GPs or trusts. Health authorities and boards are able to draw upon their experience of recruiting GPs to single-handed vacancies or making arrangements for the temporary provision of services in an emergency. They are already responsible for ensuring adequate delivery of high standards of general practice care. Trusts, on the other hand, have no such experience to help them engage salaried GPs and will face greater difficulties in drawing up job descriptions and work plans than health authorities and boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final decision about whether to approve a pilot involving salaried employment of GPs by an authority or board would rest with the Secretary of State. There seems no pressing reason why such employment should be automatically excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a number of observations on the points that have been made by the hon. Gentleman. The argument rests on the important division between those who purchase and deliver services. It is right to point to that—it is a principle which it is important to preserve as far as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leith discussed NHS trusts being in a difficult situation, which raises a different matter: a potential conflict of interest with which we have dealt in earlier debates and which I concede would have to be carefully examined in certain
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0567">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>191</span>
circumstances. But that is very different from what is being suggested this morning in relation to a health authority directly employing a general practitioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one has yet told me in any meaningful way why direct employment and a salaried status are so important. Under the part I arrangements, it would be perfectly possible—in terms of meeting all the important obligations involved in delivering a service—for a health authority to contract with an individual practitioner to provide the relevant element of the service should it so choose. If a doctor wants to make a direct, individual arrangement with a health authority, it is theoretically possible for that to be done. The distinction between being salaried and having a contract with the health authority to provide the service is pretty meaningless and rather theoretical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are practical reasons why it would be wrong to open up that avenue as a way forward. I do not rely merely on the argument about the importance of maintaining the divide between the purchaser and provider functions. We have quite rightly spent a considerable amount of time discussing how the legislation will ensure a proper distribution of general practitioners throughout Britain, especially in health authority areas where there are difficulties in securing provision. We have spent quite some time discussing the role of the resource allocation group in allocating general practitioner vacancies, and ensuring that the MPC not only maintains its role in part II arrangements but has an overview, along with the resource allocation group, of part I arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that health authorities could decide to employ salaried GPs—although I doubt that they would choose to do so—would drive a coach and horses through the careful and important debates that we have had, during which I listened carefully to Opposition Members' remarks. Health authorities acting in that way would cause us some difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be residual powers for health authorities so that if all else fails, they are obliged to provide services. I suggest that it is far better for the health authority to maintain the role for which it has been designed in statute—to assess local needs and then to contract for them with NHS providers. In that way, health authorities have the maximum incentive to get the best deal for the local community. It is important that they be seen to stand apart from the provider role and to do what they are best equipped to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To allow a health authority to employ GPs and provide services directly in more circumstances than is already the case, would remove any external day-to-day monitoring of the services being provided. Of course, health authorities provide that function no more so than under the new arrangements under which they will enter into a detailed contract with the practitioners who will provide the new part I arrangements. There is an even greater argument than
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>192</span>
there was before to maintain the important division, which has served patients well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. Member for Leith to consider those matters. I wonder whether the new clause is worth pressing to a vote. I must tell the hon. Gentleman that during the course of our discussions and consultations, some voices suggested that the new clause might be a sensible way forward, but many more voices suggested that it would not be. In particular, those who provide existing part II arrangements or hope to provide part I arrangements thought that if a health authority had unfettered power to employ a salaried general practitioner, that could be an unseen threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, my argument rests on this point: even though we do not accept the new clause, the Bill contains the ability to replicate all its arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a genuinely interesting argument, to which we might well return. I have two comments at this point: first, if the Minister is suggesting that the distinction between a traditional contract and being a salaried GP is meaningless, why are salaried GPs being proposed at all? Secondly, I accept that it is the role of health authorities to assess local need and to contract with NHS providers. If GPs were just NHS providers I could accept the logic of the argument, but GPs also have an increasingly large purchasing role, which the Government are encouraging and which is a serious flaw in the Minister's argument. The argument will continue, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the new clause is to amend the Opticians Act 1989 to make it easier for

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>195</span>
optometrists in primary care to refer patients for medical attention. The new clause fits well with the Bill because its purpose is to improve an important aspect of primary health care, optometrists being a crucial part of the primary health care team.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause has the support of all the relevant professions—optometrists, general medical practitioners and ophthalmologists—and the General Optical Council. Fourteen million eye examinations are carried out each year in this country, the vast majority of them by optometrists and the remainder by medical practitioners. The professional bodies have estimated that approximately 5 per cent. of all eye examinations result in the referral of patients by optometrists to medical practitioners. Sometimes, patients seen by optometrists are not referred to a medical practitioner, but because the optometrist has seen something non-threatening in the eye, the general practitioner is notified of the patient's condition. It is estimated that referrals and notifications together account for 10 per cent. of all eye examinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the current situation is that the General Optical Council's rules on referrals are bad law. They require optometrists to refer all patients who have signs of injury or disease of the eye to a medical practitioner. The notifications to which I referred are technically a breach of the rules. The General Optical Council freely admits that the current rules on referrals are bad law. They cause two problems. First, the requirement on the optometrist is an absolute one and does not allow the optometrist to exercise clinical judgment for the benefit of the patient. If an elderly patient has signs of incipient cataract, the optometrist may recognise that the cataract is unlikely to cause a problem before the end of the patient's life and it could be distressing for such a patient to be referred to a medical practitioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second problem with the current rules is that if they were observed fully, an additional burden would be placed on the medical profession—both general medical practitioners and ophthalmologists—and the hospital eye service, which is the secondary health care sector. The medical profession recognises that optometrists, using their clinical judgment, sometimes see abnormalities which are benign or need no treatment, as in the example I gave of an elderly patient with incipient cataract. In such circumstances the medical profession accepts that the patient should not be referred. New clause 21 would allow the General Optical Council to amend its rules to take account of such circumstances.

In short, the new clause covers three possibilities. First, an optometrist may see injury or disease in a patient's eye which requires medical treatment and refer the patient. Secondly, an optometrist may see something that in his or her clinical judgment requires no medical advice or treatment but requires the optometrist to notify the patient's GP. Thirdly, the optometrist may see a trivial abnormality and decide that no action is necessary other than to record the condition in the patient's notes.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
In conclusion, optometrists are an important part of the primary health care team and to do their job properly they need to have a more up-to-date regulatory framework. By giving the General Optical Council the power to amend its rules on referral, new clause 21 would contribute to the better performance of optometrists within primary care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Thurnham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bolton, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 29 is in my name and is probing in nature. I do not want to detain the Committee by pushing it any further than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is designed to ask the Government to clarify the situation of optometrists. Until now, we have not really had much debate about optometrists. The new clause also raises the question of charges for eye tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To remind the Committee of the background, in April 1989 the Government abolished free eye tests, including any exemption for pensioners. My constituents were much opposed to that, but I gave the Government the benefit of the doubt on the basis that there would be savings in costs to the NHS. I am now much persuaded by the excellent arguments given by the British Medical Association and the Royal National Institute for the Blind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In March 1995, the BMA produced an excellent document on free eye examinations for the over-65s, which reviewed what had happened in the six years since the abolition of the free test. The document points to the extra costs that have arisen for the NHS and to the deterioration in the quality of life of many millions of pensioners who cannot afford to pay for an eye test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the study was conducted, the pension for a couple was £84 a week. If one considers that eye tests on the high street cost about £15 or £20 per person, a couple would have to pay £30 or £40, which is nearly half the week's income—a great deal more if one considers only disposable income. About 7 million pensioners live on or very close to income support levels. In fact, many are eligible for extra benefits, but do not claim them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequence of the abolition of free tests has been that the number of eye tests has dropped by about 4 million. During the six-year period analysed by the BMA, about 45,000 additional people became blind or partially sighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments put forward by the BMA are strongly supported by the Association of Optometrists. The number of high street eye tests has remained static at about 14 million a year, but the number of referrals from GPs to hospitals has risen because pensioners can see their GP free of charge and then go to the hospital. That has put pressure on hospital ophthalmic departments and led to rising waiting lists for out-patients and in-patients. The BMA's analysis shows that over the six-year period, there has been a 50 per cent. rise in waiting lists for inpatients—from about 80,000 to 120,000. It is clear that that results in higher costs for the Government. The cost of a referral to hospital is much higher than that of providing a free eye test. The eye test costs less

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>197</span>
than £20 if it is commissioned by the NHS, whereas a referral to a hospital out-patient department costs £40. With the GP's costs, the total cost will be £50 or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On top of that, the RNIB argues that the pressure placed on high-street opticians to reduce their costs to allow people who would not otherwise be able to afford an eye test to have one, has led to a fall in standards to some extent. A survey carried out by 	<i>Which</i>? in December 1996 showed that the overall standards of eye tests were becoming very low. There are no official standards, and regulatory requirements provide only a broad framework. By law, eye tests should include a comprehensive eye examination to check for any disease, injury or abnormality, but they vary widely throughout the United Kingdom. Service users have no benchmark from which to gauge the quality of their eye test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's recent White Paper stressed the need for the systematic setting of standards to achieve quality of care, and the quality of tests is a key factor to detect not only poor vision and blindness but the many serious diseases, such as diabetes and glaucoma, which can be identified by an eye test. To detect many of those conditions, a full inspection of the retina is needed, but research carried out in Oxfordshire and elsewhere by the RNIB showed that such tests were infrequently performed. The RNIB believes that the development and promotion of national standards for the eye test, combined with a programme of audit, would improve the detection of disease. I press the Government to consider reinstating free eye tests for pensioners in recognition of the importance of eye checks in primary health care. That proposal is strongly supported by the BMA and the Association of Optometrists, as well as bodies such as the RNIB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in my opening remarks, the purpose of the amendment is to probe the Government's position, both on how the Bill relates to optometrists, because they have been mentioned so little, and on providing free eye tests for those over the age of 60 or 65.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with new clause 21. I listened carefully to what the hon. Gentleman said. He raised an important practical point and there is something of an anomaly, as practice has changed since the legislation that governs the rules was introduced and, more importantly, so has the interrelationship between the professions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome what I perceive to be a joint approach from all the professionals involved in order to bring about some sort of workable change. I do not intend to detain the Committee by dealing with the hon. Gentleman's remarks point by point, but I have carefully considered the new clause and listened to the hon. Gentleman's arguments, which are similar to those that have been made to me directly by members of the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that change is necessary. However, there are several technical defects in the new clause. For example, it refers to optometrists
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>198</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"who have from time to time been contracted to supply general ophthalmic services".</p></blockquote>
That would not include those optometrists who do only private work. However, I should like to take away the new clause and consider it before Report to see if a workable formula can be submitted at that stage. I see no fundamental obstacle to that. I also want to satisfy myself that such an arrangement would be acceptable to all interested parties. I am confident that if the hon. Gentleman agrees to withdraw the new clause, we shall be able to make some progress, although I cannot give him a guarantee. I hope that in acknowledging that we accept the arguments, he will understand that we wish positively to make progress in that direction. I thank the hon. Gentleman for drawing that important matter to the Committee's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to new clause 29, which the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) said was a probing new clause. He will know that the debate on that subject has been well rehearsed, although I do not blame him for raising it again. We are aware of the concern that has been expressed on the issue. Indeed, I have received several delegations in my departmental office from people who have made precisely the same points as those raised by the hon. Gentleman. However, some of the links and logical consequences applied in his arguments are not necessarily proven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the great tests of whether Government policy deprived people of the correct number of eye tests is the overall number of tests taking place in the NHS and the private sector. The hon. Gentleman said that the figure was static. The truth is that it is growing but not at a considerable rate. The argument always changes in such instances. The argument was that the number of eye tests would fall dramatically. However, the truth is that, following the natural falling away after the blip caused by those who took up the offer of free eye tests while time allowed, the trend of increase in all sectors providing eye tests is now continuing. I am not complacement about that. As I have said before, both to those who have come to see me on this subject and in the 	<i>Official Report</i>—either on the Floor of the House or in another Committee—we consider such matters carefully. We examine trends over time and we would consider any demonstrable evidence that people could be seriously disadvantaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I and, I think, other Conservative Members signed an early-day motion a few weeks ago expressing some of the concerns raised by the hon.

important to develop policies to ensure, where possible, that resources are targeted to where they are needed—to those sections of the population especially at risk. That concern lay behind our need to target the families of those at risk of, for example, glaucoma and, in the case of eye care, it lies behind the evolution of shared care schemes across professions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with many aspects of primary care, we are dealing with an evolving process. It is important to meet any proven possibility of providing better care. When we are talking about a limited resource, it is better to look at the principle of targeting care than to re-establish something general that is less easy to prove has a definable result. It is a serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the opportunity to emphasise the role that those in the eye care professions will have as a result of the new primary care arrangements. They made a great contribution to our discussions during the listening exercise and to what has followed. I pay tribute to them for that and I fully expect them to be involved with their co-professionals in the preparation of pilot schemes. They will have an important role and I am glad that we have had a chance to mention it in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clauses relate to the need to have pilot schemes for joint commissioning. I am grateful to officials of the House and to the Government for their help in drafting the new clauses. I have had no need to consult anyone else because the Government's briefing gave all the arguments in favour of joint commissioning schemes. I am surprised that there is nothing in the Bill about joint commissioning schemes because the Government appear to support the strong arguments in favour of them. Earlier this month, in the Scottish White Paper on health, the government announced their desire to break down further the organisational boundaries between health and social care through the establishment of pilot primary care joint commissioning projects. I am sure that the Minister is familiar with that document, but, if he is not, I shall be happy to lend him a copy because its arguments support so well everything that I want to say now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill would be a perfect vehicle for a mechanism which by its very nature
	<br><blockquote><p>"should be tailored to fit particular local needs and activities."</p></blockquote>
That is what was said on page 2 of the Department of Health's introduction to joint commissioning published back in 1995. The title of the Bill is the National Health Service (Primary Care) Bill [	<i>Lords</i>], not the Primary Health Care Bill [	<i>Lords</i>].
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain why joint commissioning in primary care is necessary. Since the introduction of community care reforms in 1993, boundaries of primary and social care have become increasingly blurred, especially regarding the care of elderly, disabled and mentally ill people. Those who previously would have been cared for in long-term hospitals are now living more and more in the community, a process that is to be welcomed but which is not easy. The gaps and loopholes in the system are now becoming increasingly evident, particularly in the practice of bed booking, which is an appalling example of the lack of a coherent framework for social and health care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the launch of the Green Paper on mental health of few weeks ago, the Secretary of State acknowledged the glaring gaps that have emerged in the care of mentally ill people because of the failure of inter-departmental co-operation. He made several proposals for filling those gaps, one of which was joint commissioning. The Green Paper specifically looks at the need for funding mechanisms to be modified to support more effective partnerships between health and local authorities. In launching it, the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Status Quo is not an option."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>204</span>
On this issue there is an overriding consensus in support of joint commissioning. Philip Hunt, director of the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We must remove all the obstacles to joint commissioning."</p></blockquote>
Denise Platt of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We call on the Government to work with us to develop joint commissioning as a reality for the future".</p></blockquote>
Jennifer Bernard from the Association of Directors of Social Services said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We all want the outcomes for users and carers to be the best possible. Closer working is the best way forward".</p></blockquote>
The director of the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health said,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Joint commissioning is happening in some parts of the country, but this is usually because of the determination of a handful of dedicated people who want to make it work. What's needed is a proper statutory framework for joint commissioning which will create a single funding stream".</p></blockquote>
Significantly, the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, the ACC, the ADSS, AMA and NAHAT all see joint commissioning pilots as the way forward in developing service. That is supported by many GPs. The BMA has also said that it would be interested to see pilots in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The plight of the elderly as a result of the current gap in the legislation is highlighted in a report published this week entitled "Standards of Medical Care for Older People", which was produced by the British Geriatrics Society. One of Bolton's top doctors, Dr. Amp Banerjee, medical director of the Bolton Hospitals NHS trust and president of the BGS, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Health services have been failing our older generations through inadequate and sub-standard medical and social care".</p></blockquote>
Dr. Banerjee went on to point out the gap in provision between hospitalisation and care by untrained staff. He feels that in that respect GPs are in an excellent position to help through joint commissioning schemes with social services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of Health's book on joint commissioning has a chapter on how that is affected by inter-departmental co-operation. The current legal framework is contradictory and confusing not only for the public but for GPs and social workers. Under the National Health Service Act 1977 funds can be transferred from health authorities to local authorities but it is illegal to transfer funds from local authorities to health authorities. The solution to that problem at present is via schedule 113 of the Local Government Act 1972, which permits local authorities to have access to services of the staff of health authorities or trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of Health guidelines published in the practical guidance book propose that expert legal advice should determine how joint commissioning projects are established. It is absurd to say that expert legal advice should determine how patients should be treated. It is patients' needs that should determine services, not inconsistent legal technicalities. The BMA says that GPs all too often have a nightmare with community care. They complain that the present

system is not conducive to patients—especially elderly patients—being put first. Directors of social services support proposals to allow joint commissioning initiatives to deal with the problems and constraints that they face in not being allowed to pass money to GPs. I shall give two examples of the difficulties that are occurring on the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Lewisham, there is a classic example that shows how the law is hampering effective joint commissioning between health authorities and local authorities where those authorities had agreed a proposal to allow the health authority to run the mental health services. The local authority proposed to pass over its budget to the health authority and everyone on the ground felt that that would be by far the best solution to local needs. Just before the project got off the ground, however, the Audit Commission stepped in and said that the transfer of the budget was ultra vires and could not go ahead. Those artificial restraints should be removed to allow local agreements to be set up where that suits local circumstances.

My second example relates to the London borough of Sutton, which approached joint commissioning with great enthusiasm and vigour. There has been enormous success in relation to mental health, people with learning difficulties, care of older people—which has been integrated—and those receiving continuing NHS care in the community. Sutton has been adopted as a pilot site by the King's Fund for a national joint commissioning research initiative into joint primary care. It is also working closely with the south-west London total purchasing pilot to develop more coordinated services for older people. I commend Sutton's social services and the health authority for their many initiatives and for working together to try to secure more and better services for users and carers with the same or fewer resources. Sutton is one of the many local authorities and social services departments that supports moves to rationalise its options in joining GPs in the proper provision of comprehensive primary health and social care. Local authorities and health authorities should not have to risk breaking the law to develop successful care policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, I was delighted to see that the Scottish White Paper, "Ready for the Future", which was published a week ago, recommended the establishment of six pilot joint commissioning projects in Scotland. I thoroughly agree with the Government's argument in that document about the need for a primary care pilot joint commissioning project as the way to achieve a seamless service that is based on the individual's needs and not on the services of the agency that is first contacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 96 of the White Paper referes to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"repeated pleas from those who work within the Service for greater flexibility … across the health/social care interface."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 90, which appears on page 31, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Care in the Community is an important policy which complements the development of Primary Care … It requires cooperation at the strategic, operational and service provision levels
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
between health, social work and housing interests and also requires a shift in resources and provision from long-term hospital care to community care."</p></blockquote>
On page 32, the White Paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government now judges that it would be desirable to move further to break down the organisational boundaries between health and social care, as these can be confusing to patients and can hinder the co-ordinated provision of care. Either the GP or the Social Work Department can be the key to the services needed, and in consequence there can be confusion and uncertainty about who to turn to in particular cases. This is especially so in more complex cases where the need for assistance is greatest. This confusion is not confined to the public. It occurs amongst those responsible for providing the services. It follows that one of the main ways of making the system more responsive to public needs is to help to remove some of the confusion about existing organisational arrangements."</p></blockquote>
The White Paper goes on to describe the initiative of six pilot schemes to promote the local integration of primary health and social care through devolution of funding, accountability and team work across all the professional groups that are involved in primary care. Health boards, trusts, GPs and local authorities in Scotland will be invited to submit proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The benefits of joint commissioning are only too evident. There are many benefits and they will continue to grow in importance as the impact of demographic changes and community care policies lead to more people needing care in community settings. We would have the benefit of a seamless service that solved the problems of inter-agency arguments, cost-shunting and loopholes in the provision of care to some of the most vulnerable. We would secure maximum value for money, reducing duplication and providing complementary services. The highest-quality service would combine expertise and ideas and there would be a better general picture of need and plans for future needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the Government's own arguments, they should include the new clause in the Bill. That would facilitate innovative solutions to a growing problem, which must be dealt with as soon as possible. The Bill provides an opportunity to make progress on the development of a seamless service of primary care and I hope that the Minister will feel able to accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I must disappoint the hon. Gentleman by saying instantly that I cannot accept his new clause, although I share many of the objectives that it sets out. In some ways, the hon. Gentleman has destroyed his argument by providing excellent examples, which we want to make more the norm than the exception. However, primary legislation as suggested in the new clause is, perhaps, not the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1995, we published "Practical Guidance on Joint Commissioning". Many of the comments made by the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East related to the importance of that. Although joint commissioning is the way forward and a sensible way to provide seamless care, it is very different from changing the funding strands on which services are based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is not the means to achieve what the hon. Gentleman wants. Joint commissioning already allows two or more agencies to act together to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>207</span>
coordinate their commissioning, taking joint responsibility for translating strategy into action in order to achieve better outcomes for users and carers. Local authorities and health authorities have the powers necessary to achieve that. I am not entirely sure whether the hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that if we changed the structure of the funding streams as proposed in the new clause, we would do better. The funding streams behind the two types of service are from different sources, are used in different ways and have different rules. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that we have explored the issue in the mental health service, to which he referred, where there are specific challenges in coordinating services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Green Paper, "Developing Partnerships in Mental Health", published on 4 February, considers how the current organisational framework might be made to work more effectively and sets out options for structural change, including shared budget arrangements. On the whole, those working in mental health have welcomed the opportunity to contribute to the discussion about the most appropriate changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a Green Paper on mental health is in the public domain, and although I welcome the opportunity provided by the new clause to explore an important issue and to set on the record the Government's approach, it seems sensible to consider the responses to the consultation on the Green Paper before progressing with any legislation. On that basis, I ask the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East to withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed with the Minister's reply. If legislation was introduced to allow joint commissioning to work without the legal difficulties to which I have already referred, it would not reduce the options in the Green Paper on mental health—it would increase them because the clarity of option 3 on a joint health and social care body would be so much more evident. I press the Minister to reconsider his statement and hope that we might be able to return to the issue on Report.

We all knew that if we did not behave ourselves we would be brought to heel.

I particularly wish to thank you, Sir Alan, for the good-humoured way in which you have presided over the Committee and those who have supported you—the Clerks and the 	<i>Official Report staff.</i> I also pay tribute to my officials.

I welcome the important and detailed debates that we have had on issues that will endure. Seldom has a Committee had the opportunity—this has been the first opportunity for 50 years—to consider an issue that affects everyone in the country and a whole range of health care professionals who provide an important service. The Committee has been constructive and that is largely due to your chairmanship, Sir Alan, and keeping the factions apart so that we did not spill over into disorder, which would not have served the public interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
