	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ann Coffey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Joint Consultative Committees Order 1996 (S.I., 1996, No. 2820).</p></blockquote>
The joint consultative committees were set up in 1974 to improve planning between local authority social services departments and the national health service, and in 1976 joint financing was introduced. Money was allocated for the health budget to be spent on personal social services projects—in other words, on social care. The idea was to help to transfer resources and patients from hospitals to the community, and to help to achieve the objectives of community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community care relies on effective co-operation across health and social care boundaries. The difficulty of achieving such co-operation cannot be underestimated. There are differences between health services and social services with regard to their cultures, their accountability processes—both political and financial—and their budget cycles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the last joint consultative committees order the structure of health services has been changed and the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 has come into effect. Those changes increased the competitive framework within which health services and social services are delivered, and they have thrown into sharp focus the debate about the definitions of health and social care. They have also led to difficulties in the development of proper strategic and planning frameworks. However, the joint consultative committees should help to overcome such difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that there was a consultative exercise over the summer—before the order was drafted—which explains the eight-month delay. What was the nature of that consultation and what responses were there to it? What reviews has the Department of Health undertaken of joint consultative committees? Does the Minister think that, in general, joint consultative committees satisfactorily achieve their objectives? If not, how could their performance be improved? It seems that they are effective in some areas as planning mechanisms but that in other respects they simply oversee specific projects and the application of joint financing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What guidelines has the Department of Health issued on joint consultative committees since the policy guidance that was issued in 1990 in response to the White Paper, "Caring for People—Care in the Next Decade and Beyond"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The joint consultative committees are a forum that fulfills local authorities' duties under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, which requires them to agree their community care plans with health authorities and to consult widely with voluntary organisations, carers and service users.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to keep joint consultative committees properly informed. The addition of voluntary organisation representatives is much welcomed—they have relevant experience and knowledge and have worked as service providers. As the Minister knows, voluntary organisations presently have only limited representation. However, the voluntary sector is diverse in any locality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To fulfil their proper consultative role, joint consultative committees must ensure that information cascades downwards and that responses are fed back properly. In view of the wide diversity of the voluntary sector, that is a pressing problem—consultations are only as good as the process of consultation. That may involve, at worst, a token gesture or, at best, a widely informed debate. Some joint consultative committees have employed joint planning officers to ensure that there is proper consultation with the voluntary sector. Has the Minister evaluated those officers' contributions in that respect?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is increasing recognition of the valuable contribution by the nation's 12 million informal carers. The recent Disabled Persons and Carers (Short-Term Breaks) Bill ensured that their needs would have to be taken into account in any assessment of services. It would seem reasonable that they should also have a voice in the wider consultation and planning in which the JCCs are involved—after all, there would be no community care without the contribution of informal carers. Will the Minister consider issuing guidelines and ensuring the representation of carers on JCCs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I have to say that there is a dearth of information about the joint consultative committees and the evaluation of their work. Can the Minister tell me how his Department is evaluating their work and what monitoring has been undertaken, particularly with regard to their use of joint finance and the outcomes of projects for which joint finance has been used?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.36 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In some other forums, including one chaired by you, Sir Giles, I have spoken about the need to break down some of the vertically intergrated structures in public service. The present measure represents an extremely good example of an attempt to do that, but we could all go much further. We all see in our surgeries every week plenty of examples of the failure of one department to consult another, particularly in the relationship between social services and the national health service. In some cases that failure is extensive, and consultation ought to include, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ms Coffey) said, the voluntary sector, as well as other statutory bodies, as the individual case requires. Although I welcome the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
fact that the order will modernise the joint consultative committees, I ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that that goes far enough, considering the casework that we all see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall a recent constituency case that the social services, health and housing departments each said was not their responsibility. It was a difficult case concerning a young boy with learning difficulties who had got into trouble with the law. The court did not think that the case was its responsibility. There was a buck-passing exercise. We need mechanisms to ensure that when such difficult cases emerge, a lead authority is rapidly identified and proper steps are taken to ensure that families such as the one that I had to advise do not find themselves at a loss to know where to go. There ought to be clear structures to help them. I hope that the Minister, in pursuing the order, will make it clear to statutory authorities and voluntary agencies around the country that he agrees with that view, and will encourage departments not to pass the buck in the way that I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.39 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having been a chairman of social services who was also chairman of a joint consultative committee, I ask the Minister why nothing is said in the order about the arrangements for chairing the organisation. The committee in Leeds functioned well. I was chair of the social services committee and one of your more notable constituents, Sir Giles. I believe that a member of your constituency association was chair of Leeds health authority. The committee worked smoothly, partly because it had funding with which it could carry out joint work. That matters, because co-operation can take place when an organisation has specific projects to carry forward. The health authority and Leeds city council's department of social services had a good relationship, which was based on their constructive work. That was particularly the case in Rothwell—which will become part of my constituency if I am returned at the election—where there was a liaison project. The Department of Health used that project as an example of a local authority and social services working together constructively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Joint consultative committees are quite successful and, like my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller), I want to know what monitoring has taken place to discover the ingredients for their success. It is important for the delivery of community care that social service departments and health authorities have a good relationship. That is particularly so now that we are dealing not with two health authorities—the family health services authority and the health authority—but with a single health authority. It is also important that the JCCs include the voluntary sector. Does the Minister envisage arrangements to monitor JCCs to discover the ingredients for their success? Where joint consultative committees are in place, the different bodies within them could develop closer relationships, which would be in the interests of community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
I also want to know whether funding depends entirely on what individual authorites are prepared to contribute to joint working or whether the Department specifically encourages joint working in the case of funding that can be administered by the Committee. That was certainly the case in Leeds, although I am uncertain how that funding arose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also be useful to know what arrangements exist to chair the committees. In Leeds, the chairmanship rotated quite smoothly every two years and I took over the chair for two years when I was a constituent of yours, Sir Giles. Is a system in place to allow the different parties that are involved, particularly the statutory authorities, to share chairing arrangements? I obviously wish those organisations well, but I would like to know whether the Department is doing anything specific to help them work well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.43 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Simon Burns)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the speeches by Opposition Members. It would be sensible briefly to explain that joint consultative committees are bodies on which individual health authorities and local authorities are represented, along with representatives of the voluntary sector. Their purpose is to facilitate local collaboration between the statutory authorities in the planning and operation of health and social care services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement to establish JCCs arises from section 22 of the National Health Service Act 1977. Today's order, which replaces the 1985 order, sets out the framework under which JCCs operate and reflects health authority reorganisation under the Health Authorities Act 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Promoting collaborative working in the planning and provision of health and social care between health authorities and local authorities has long been one of the Government's priorities. Effective collaboration between all the agencies concerned is an essential prerequisite for delivery of the efficient seamless services that service users deserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The continuing work of promoting collaboration builds on several formal and complementary mechanisms, such as the community care planning services and the provision for health authority grants, which is contained in section 28A of the 1977 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Health authorities are empowed to make section 28A grants to local authorities, housing associtions or voluntary organisations to help fund personal social services or related housing or educational work for the disabled. Section 28A grants may be made either from health authorities' general allocations or, in England, from dedicated joint finance—money that is ring-fenced for that purpose. All hon. Members will agree that section 28A funding is a highly useful tool in promoting joint planning and in facilitating the continuing shift from hospital care to community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Individual JCC arrangements are largely a matter for the local statutory bodies to agree, within the framework of the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>4.46 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>4.53 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying before the interruption, individual JCC arrangements are largely a matter for the local statutory bodies to agree, within the framework of the order. Their constitutions, operating procedures and numbers of representatives are matters for local agreement. In answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell), it is for the committees to determine who will be their chairman or chairwoman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish now to turn to the question of the number of members from voluntary organisations. Hon. Members will know that there is provision for three representatives from the voluntary sector, including carer organisations, on each committee. However, if the committee wishes, it can have more than three such representatives by allowing a voluntary sector representative to take one of the health authority or local authority places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a requirement of the National Health Service Act 1977 that every health authority must meet each of the local authorities sharing its area on at least one joint consultative committee. Under the order, each committee must include three nominated members from the voluntary sector. Having additional members from the allocations of representatives to health or local authorities is possible through negotiation. The order also sets out the arrangements by which the electorate of voluntary organisations is identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Health Authorities Act 1995, which came into effect on 1 April 1996, impacted on JCCs in several ways. The major impact was the creation of new health authorities in place of the old district health authorities and the FHSAs. One effect of abolishing DHAs and FHSAs on 31 March last year was to terminate the existing joint consultative committees on which the former authorities were represented. New committees were needed and were established from 1 April last year, and the requisite voluntary sector membership was arranged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Additionally, the boundaries of some of the new health authorities differed from those of their predecessors and, coincidentally, local authority reform was also changing a number of local authority boundaries. Following those various changes, authorities were invited to review their local JCC arrangements with a view to future service planning. With that in mind, and to ease the immediate task of establishing new JCCs, the rules on voluntary sector representation were temporarily amended under a transitional provisions order. Those transitional arrangements were due to end on 1 October 1996. However, following informal representations from a number of authorities asking for more time, the Government accepted the case for extending the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
transitional period by three months to 31 December last year. The draft order was therefore amended to take effect from 1 January 1997 in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal briefly with hon. Members' questions. The hon. Member for Stockport asked whether the committees—20 years old—are still considered effective as a planning tool. The governing principles of the order are to provide an effective, flexible forum to advise statutory bodies on the planning and operation of services of common concern. Those principles do not date. We recognise that JCCs may become under-used or marginalised form time to time. The need is to stimulate more effective use of joint planning mechanisms such as JCCs, which is exactly what we are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also asked about the review of the joint finance allocation formula, whose purpose was to ensure that resources were allocated effectively and which is reviewed from time to time. The new formula seeks to ensure that resources available for joint finance reflect the needs of local populations. Changes to allocations are introduced by a taper, so as to avoid sudden changes and disruptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South asked about the amount of money involved. The total amount in England is £152 million, ring fenced in order to help to provide joint finance and to supply services that are relevant and needed by the local population represented by the committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about monitoring, which is on-going. Monitoring of committee performance is done at a local level. Clearly, those on the committee want the job to be done as effectively as possible, so that involves a form of monitoring albeit not in the classic definition of the expression. Additionally, there is monitoring at national level—for instance through the social, services inspectorate, which will keep an eye on work that is being done. Similarly, there is joint monitoring by Department of the Environment Government offices, which consider matters such as the housing interest. I hope that that covers the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Gerard Vaughan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Reading, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the staffing of the committees? I see that the order refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person to act as its Secretary."</p></blockquote>
I should have thought that such committees would involve a lot of paperwork. Do the Government envisage committees having a paid, professional staff and if so, what will that cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's concerns about the committees' work generating considerable cost, but I hope that I can reassure him on that. The committees to which the order refers are no different from those that have existed hitherto—except for the reasons that I gave earlier. We are not expecting vast bureaucracies: they have not existed in the past and there is no reason for them to exist in the future. Where secretarial help is required, it will be provided by local authorities and health authorities. As both are members of the committees and have a vested interest
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
in keeping the costs down, that arrangement will be seen as a brake and a way of ensuring that there is no massive ballooning of bureacracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the sum of £152 million. I assume that that is provided by the Department of Health, although the Minister said that the Department of the Environment would be involved in monitoring. I am pleased that it is intended to have members of housing committees as members of the joint consultative committees, because housing is an important factor in social care. When making community care provision for people, it is often the wish of both the health authority and social services that something is done about accommodation for those who are being released from hospital care to community care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears from the rules that an observer scheme was previously a voluntary arrangement. Obviously the health authority and social services departments are both purchasers, and this is an organisation of purchasers. I seem to remember that my joint consultative committee invited representatives from the two teaching hospitals in Leeds to be present as observers. Is it normal to have observers? There would be the possibility of matters coming up which related to what they were doing. Voluntary sector bodies also have a providing role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The £152 million is provided by the Department of Health. With regard to housing, the Department of the Environment will monitor, through its local office, the housing aspect—there is the question of housing associations, for example. As the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South said, housing can be a critical part of people's health needs. The DoE local offices monitor but they do not have responsibility for providing finances. However, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that joint financing may be used for housing purposes—that is why there is a monitoring input by the Department of the Environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether observers can attend the committees is a matter for the local committee to determine. If a local committee believes that it is useful, helpful and worth while to have observers—either on a regular basis or from time to time on specific problems—no doubt it will use the flexibility available to it and exercise its judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I commend the order to the Committee. The Government are committed to the closest collaboration possible at a local level so that we can identify and be in touch with local needs in order to provide and enhance the best service for local communities and those whom the joint committees are trying to help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, the statement about encouraging collaboration at a local level must be measured against the effectiveness of the mechanisms for doing that. In accepting the principle underlying the joint consultative committees, which is that they are an effective, flexible forum for joint planning, we must examine how that effectiveness is measured. I am not satisfied with the Minister's response to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
problem of joint consultative committees that do not perform planning functions or encourage cooperation but simply concentrate on overseeing joint finance. He said that he was stimulating more effective use. How is that being stimulated? What guidelines have been issued by the Department of Health to ensure that the committees are functioning effectively, and what guidance has been given on best practice elsewhere?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can satisfy the hon. Lady on this matter. She will no doubt be aware that in May 1995 we published guidance on joint commissioning which was intended to help the committees encourage local authorities and health authorities to continue or develop work on joint commissioning within existing and changing organisational structures and the legislative framework. Guidance was also given on how some of the technical problems and practical difficulties faced by authorities could be minimised and overcome. We hoped to provide a lead through guidance to help joint committees move forward and improve their performance and ability to carry out their duties where needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Joint commissioning is a separate issue. I did not understand that joint consultative committees were considered to be joint commissioning forums. I read the Department of Health's document on joint commissioning. One of the difficulties with joint commissioning is the current legal framework and the associated obstacles. The document helpfully suggested that anyone who wanted to embark on joint commissioning should consult their lawyer and the district auditors. However, that is a separate issue. I am interested in how the joint consultative committees that oversee joint finance will be stimulated to be more effective. What guidelines have been issued in relation to the working of the joint consultative committees?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that monitoring was continuing. I was interested to hear him say that the best form of monitoring by the committees was self-monitoring, as the Government do not hold that view in relation to local government or other organisations. I am sure that many organisations would be happy to embark on self-monitoring if the Government agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The social services inspectorate has a specific role and has inspected a number of services provided by health authorities and local authorities. But there are specific inspections in relation to specific areas, such as mental illness. As far as I know, they do not play an ongoing monitoring and inspection role on joint consultative committees, but if the Minister says that that is part of their role, it is an interesting development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised some issues in relation to carers. I appreciate the paraphernalia of technicalities, but the Minister did not pick up my point, which was that because of the huge number of informal cases, some are represented by voluntary organisations and some are not. Many authorities have gone to great trouble to involve carers in the consultation process because care in the community relies on a partnership between formal and informal services. The Government have a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0388">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
view on the inclusion of representatives from voluntary organisations on joint consultative committees. Do they also have a view on including the opinions of carers in future guidance by the Department? If the Minister thinks that extending consultation with carers is advisable, will he make that clear to the joint consultative committees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reiterate and further clarify some of the points that the hon. Lady raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Firstly, on the subject of monitoring collaborative working, the social services inspectorate has an ongoing remit, which we regard as a key element of its work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of monitoring the performance of committees, there is not much evidence to show that people have serious concern about how the committees have operated in the past. As I said earlier, performance can be patchy, either between committees or, at times, within a committee, depending on the members of that committee and other factors. We have issued practical guidance, which emphasises and illustrates the role of joint consultative committees in collaborative work. That is an important factor in helping them to go about their tasks, especially in the early days when there are new members on a committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also raised the question of carers. Of course some carers are independent and not members of any voluntary or carer organisation but those who are members of such organisations are part of the umbrella of voluntary organisations that will be represented on joint consultative committees. As was said earlier, there is nothing to prevent a committee from calling for observers at any time during its deliberations, so there would be nothing to stop a committee calling a carer to make an input or give his or her views to the committee. I am confident that,
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
through representatives or observers committees will be able to hear the views of people in that part of the voluntary sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Coffey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As there is no monitoring mechanism for the joint consultative committees, the Minister has no way of finding out whether that will actually happen. The Government have a view about voluntary organisations being represented on committees. I welcome that because such representatives are a valuable addition, but the Government have not been content to let good practice develop. They are saying that, in addition, they want representatives of voluntary organisations on the JCCs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister feels that that idea is important, why cannot he also apply it to carers' organisations? Joint consultative committees are not monitored, so the only way to ensure representation of carers on JCCs is for the Minister to say that they should be represented on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Lady slightly misunderstands. There is nothing to stop one of the three representatives from the voluntary sector on the committee being a representative of a carers' organisation. If the health or local authorities wish to give up a place so that an additional person from the voluntary sector can be on the committee, there is nothing to stop them doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady must know that there is a statutory requirement to involve carers in the consultation on community care plans. She should be reassured that carers, who form a valuable and crucial group in social services and social care provision, have ample opportunities, in the ways that I have just explained, to have their views and concerns taken on board on such committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
