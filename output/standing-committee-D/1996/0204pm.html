<p><i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 9, in page 4, line 4, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(6) The provisions of section (<i>Code of practice on the use of information held under this Act by the police</i>) shall apply to information notified to the police under this section.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>New Clause 1—<i>Access to information</i>
<br><blockquote><p>—(1) The Secretary of State may, by order made by statutory instrument, specify those persons or bodies to whom a chief officer of police may supply details notified to him under section 2 of this Act.
<ol>
<li>An order made under subsection (1) above shall be laid before Parliament in draft and shall be subject to approval by a resolution of each House before being made.</li>
<li>An order made under subsection (1) above may permit a chief officer of police to provide information to—
<ol>
<li>a local education authority, grant-maintained school or private school;</li>
<li>a health authority or NHS trust;</li>
<li>a social services authority;</li></ol>
or any other person or body whom the Secretary of State thinks fit.</li>
<li>Any person who, in the course of his official duties, has or at any time has had any information supplied to him under an order made under subsection (1) above, shall be guilty of an offence if he discloses that information to any other person other than in the course of his official duties.</li>
<li>Any person who obtains any information notified to the police under section 2 of this Act by means of any fraud, dishonesty or bribe shall be guilty of an offence.</li>
<li>A person guilty of an offence under—</li>
<ol>
<li>subsection (4) above, shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 4 on the standard scale; or</li>
<li>subsection (5) above, shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both."</li></ol></ol></p></blockquote></p>

<br><blockquote><p>".—(1) The Secretary of State shall, following consultation, issue a Code of Practice setting out—</p></blockquote></p>
<p><ol>
<li>the means whereby information notified to the police under this Act is to be registered and maintained;</li>
<li>those persons who may have access to information so notified; and</li>
<li>the responsibilities of the police and others to co-operate in using information so notified for the protection of the public, including, but not confined to, responsibilities for providing information and advice to members of the public and to statutory and voluntary organisations.</li>
<li>(2) A Code of Practice made under subsection (1) above shall be laid before Parliament in draft and shall be subject to approval by a resolution of each House before being made.".</li></ol></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Clapham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we broke for lunch, I was speaking to amendment No. 9 and new clause 4. I was explaining to the Minister, by way of an example from my constituency, why I consider that new clause 4, in particular, would be so important to the Bill. I was citing a case in which a widow with two young children married a man who was a paedophile. In the subsequent court case, after certain matters had come to light, it was pointed out that the marriage may have taken place only because the man wanted to get to the children.<br><br>
If new clause 4 was accepted, the information on the register that will be maintained by the police would be available to other agencies, in particular to the social services, which could therefore have informed the unfortunate woman that the man with whom she was having a liaison was a paedophile and that he would be a danger to her children.<br><br>
It is important that the Minister accepts the need for a code of practice as set in new clause 4. It is no use having a register that is to be maintained by the police, which, perhaps, may be made available to social services. Certain operational priorities must be in place, so that the information can be used to protect children. Therefore, the code would become the core of the Bill. I hope that the Minister is willing to accept new clause 4 or a similar clause that will bring into being such a code of practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Thurnham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bolton, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak to new clause 1 as well as to amendment No. 9 and new clause 4. I support the proposals for a code of practice. It would be a sensible way in which to proceed. However, my new clause 1 would make it an offence to disclose information to anyone to whom it should not be disclosed.<br><br>
When discussing how the information should be used, we must consider what is happening in America under what is known as Megan's law. I understand that that law's provisions are being applied in several states throughout America. There is a requirement for all other states to consider it, although it may still be challenged in the Supreme Court on the technical issue of whether limitless retrospective and double jeopardy punishment breach constitutional rights. Megan's law is the result of the terrible tragic death of seven-year-old Megan Kanka. Her mother decided to campaign strongly because the paedophile who allegedly murdered her daughter had been living in a house on the other side of the road, a matter of which she was not aware, although other neighbours were aware of it.<br><br>
Megan's case raises the question whether such people should be released in the first place—we are dealing here with the most serious offenders. A learned colleague was in contact with the father of Sophie Hook, who was sadly murdered, and he has written to me about how a measure like Megan's law could work in this country. He states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Refer back to what happened to Sophie Hook and to Mr. Hook's campaign to have a register introduced and to the courteous and interested hearing he was given"</p></blockquote>
by the Home Secretary.
<br><blockquote><p>"Since then nothing has happened, and the Home Office plainly wants to forget the whole idea as unworkable. But it is workable. Suggest a system based on a register containing 5 levels of registered
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0605">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
information, ranging from Grade 1 serious sexual convictions to Grade 5 relevant allegations which have resulted neither in conviction nor formal discipline (e.g. conduct by someone dealing with children in a voluntary organisation against whom complaints are made). Provide a machinery through the county courts, which on the whole are quite quick, to enable proposed registrations to be challenged. Standard of proof to be balance of probabilities. Grade A registrations would be published in the area where a registered person lived, there being a requirement for registered persons to notify the police of any change of address, harassment of registered persons to be a specific and quite serious new criminal offence punishable by imprisonment."</p></blockquote>
That is the road down which the Americans seem to be going and some argue strongly that we should consider it here. I would look at it in another light, however. If people pose such a serious risk to the public that the neighbours have to be informed that they are living in the neighbourhood, we should ask whether they should be released in the first place. The Government have been making capital from their "two strokes and you're out" hard line, but one must ask whether one strike is enough for some of the people we are discussing.<br><br>
This morning, I drew the Minister's attention to the report prepared by the Home Office interdepartmental working group entitled "Sex Offenders: A Guide to Inter-Agency Co-operation". It contains numerous references to the need for pre-sentence assessment, so that when a judge is determining what would be an appropriate sentence he could ask for an assessment of the offender's characteristics and what the chances were that the offender could safely be rehabilitated into the community. If the offender belongs to the category known as high deviancy, I suggest that a judge would be better to pass an indeterminate sentence, lasting until such time as a risk assessment shows that it would be safe to let that person out. The alleged murderer of young Megan was gaoled because he had left his previous victim for dead by a river but refused psychiatric treatment while serving his sentence in prison. We must ask why he was let out in the first place.<br><br>
I believe that it would be a mistake for us to argue for the adoption of Megan's law in this country; instead, we should follow the recommendations in the Home Office report. I do not know whether the Minister would object, but if the Home Office cannot provide members of the Committee with a copy of the report, it should be placed in the Library, as it is so relevant to the points that we are discussing. On who should have access to the information, the report has a number of recommendations. Under paragraph 4.8, it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Information should be exchanged for clearly defined purposes, as and when required. Particular care must be taken to ensure that information is restricted to those whose work properly requires access to it."</p></blockquote>
If information should be restricted, I believe that it should be an offence to pass on information further than it should be. I press the Minister to ensure that the Committee is given the information that is available to him in the Home Office, as that information is so relevant to the point that we are discussing.<br><br>
Reference to the register does not appear in the Bill, but it is assumed in the workings of the Bill that there
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
must be a register. The use to which that register will be put must be carefully controlled, so that it is primarily useful in the prevention of crime and not open to abuse leading to vigilante victimisation of offenders and their families.<br><br>
On 24 January, Matthew Parris wrote in The Times:
<br><blockquote><p>"If we judge a person so dangerous that his neighbours must be warned about him, he should not be allowed back into the community."</p></blockquote>
That is the answer that I would give on whether we should have a Megan's law. The important issue is that there should be treatment and an assessment before offenders are released back into the community.<br><br>
The same points were made on Second Reading by hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Stockport (Ms Coffey), who said that it would make sense if information
<br><blockquote><p>"were also available to other Departments that keep lists with the aim of protecting children."</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Member for Conwy (Sir W. Roberts) said that he was disappointed that that was not spelt out in the Bill and that information should
<br><blockquote><p>"be confined to those with a need to know—for example, head teachers of schools."</p></blockquote>
He continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"Notification must not become an additional punishment; it must be a preventive measure."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) said that
<br><blockquote><p>"responsible organisations should in certain circumstances be able to consult the register"—[<i>Official Report,</i> 27 January 1997; Vol. 289, c. 69, 48–9, 34.]</p></blockquote>
And the hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Mrs. Clwyd) said that direction must be given to the police on the usage of information.<br><br>
4.40 pm<br><br>
<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i><br><br>
4.55 pm<br><br>
<i>On resuming—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the report, "Sex Offenders: A Guide to Inter-Agency Co-operation". I have received a number of representations from interested parties—from children's groups, and so on. It would be useful if the Minister were to place a copy of that report in the Library. I understand the Government's position, which is that events have moved on, the consultation paper has been issued, and we now have the Bill. However, a number of points made in the report are worthy of consideration. It reflects the difficulty of some of the issues with which we are dealing that the report did not make stronger recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Timothy Kirkhope)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I presume that the hon. Gentleman is referring to the draft guidance prepared in 1995 by an inter-departmental group—a guide to inter-agency co-operation on sex offenders. It is true that that document was never published, but producing it was a worthwhile exercise. It was felt, however, that it did not provide sufficient practical help in guidance to field services—that is why it was not published—but it focused attention on issues.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0606">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
Since then, the Government have issued two consultation papers. One is, "Sentencing and Supervision of Sex Offenders", which the hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee will know well, and which led to this Bill and contributed to the Crime (Sentences) Bill. The Government also recently published, "Sex Offenders: A Ban On Working With Children".<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman said a moment ago, the world has moved on in respect not only of legislation but of attitudes, in a positive manner. I do not think, therefore, that the document to which the hon. Gentleman referred should be put in the public domain—that might be slightly confusing in view of current circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister thinks that that document can be improved on, perhaps he will consider whether there should be a follow-on working party to improve it. In the meantime, people could only gain from reading what is in the report; I am not aware of any inaccuracies in it. Perhaps it does not come to sufficiently strong conclusions to deal with all our concerns, but it contains valuable information.<br><br>
For example, it makes recommendations about the working of area child protection committees, which are at the heart of the amendment and of how the information should be used. Surely, it is those committees that should have access to the information—in a controlled way—in order to determine how much further the information should go, subject to a code of practice. I support the Labour party's proposals on that matter.<br><br>
My new clause would provide for information to be passed to local education authorities, schools, health authorities and national health service trusts and social services—all bodies that are represented on the area child protection committees. It would also provide for the Secretary of State to allow information to be passed on to other bodies as he thought fit.<br><br>
To sum up, it is important to create an offence of misuse of information; it is only common sense that information be controlled in that way.<br><br>
Public expectation has been raised by publicity surrounding the Bill, with calls emanating from across the Atlantic for an American-style Megan's law to be introduced here, whereby there would be public notification when a paedophile moved into an area. I urge that we do not go down that path, but rather provide a coherent framework setting out who should be notified, with penalties for those who take the law into their own hands; otherwise, the police will find our guidelines unworkable, and we shall have a Megan's law in practice, if not in theory. Meanwhile, we should concentrate our efforts on treatment and assessment of offenders, so that people who represent a danger to the public are not released as they are now.</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Hutton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support this important group of amendments. If the Minister were to say that the Government support the principle of the amendments, the Bill would be strengthened to provide better protection for children—the key purpose of the legislation. The amendments are important
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
because they would establish the principle that it might be appropriate in certain circumstances for the police to notify parents that a dangerous sex criminal had moved into their neighbourhood.<br><br>
In arguing that that is an important principle, we must be clear that nothing in the group of amendments should be interpreted as an incitement to vigilantism or people taking the law into their own hands. I support the principle of ensuring that there is wider notification in some cases, but we must send out a clear signal that that must not be at the expense of law and order generally—it is not open to members of the public to take the law into their own hands.<br><br>
If we were being honest, we, as parents, would all want to know the whereabouts of any active sex criminal in our neighbourhood. We would want to know that not in order to torch that person's house, threaten his family or attack him with baseball bats late at night, but to protect our children—the point of this group of amendments. It should not be interpreted as an invitation to vigilantism, to which I am strongly opposed. However, we must ask ourselves whether it might be appropriate in certain circumstances for the police to inform—in a controlled, sensitive way—members of local communities of the whereabouts of such repeat sex criminals. That should be done, but it would be a mistake to be prescriptive and to define in the Bill the circumstances in which the information should be released to the wider public.<br><br>
There is scope for the Government to work with chief police officers to formulate the detail of any such scheme. It is important to accept that such a scheme would provide greater protection for children, that it would strengthen the provisions of the Bill and, therefore, that we should embrace it in principle.<br><br>
Given the history of some of these terrible crimes, it is no longer acceptable to release sex criminals into the community and hope that the problem goes away. I am afraid that it does not go away and, time after time, hideous crimes have been committed against children. Some parents believe that those crimes might have been prevented if there had been wider community involvement.<br><br>
I was struck very deeply by what some parents, whose son was killed by a paedophile, said recently about the application of Megan's law in the United States. One of the parents said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It wouldn't have been just me watching out for my son, it would have been the whole neighbourhood."</p></blockquote>
That is the important aim. It is a sensible way to mobilise the community to protect our children from the activities of such criminals, and it is the important principle on which we should focus.<br><br>
If that principle is to work in our jurisdiction, the information provided must be controlled. I am strongly against the sort of disclosure that has taken place in the United States, where flyers or leaflets have been distributed around communities or posters saying, "This man is a sex criminal; don't go near him" have been put up in libraries. That is a huge mistake, it is an open invitation to vigilantism. However, it would be useful if the police were to share information with local communities in ways more consistent with our system of policing, and we should explore such ideas.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0607">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
For me, many other hon. Members and the public, this is the most important part of the Bill. We would strengthen the Bill, help the police do their job and protect our children—the crucial purpose of the Bill—if we were to explore some of the options available to us.<br><br>
I shall not criticise the Government by saying that such a proposal should be in the Bill; I understand that they want to proceed carefully by consulting and taking soundings. I welcome that. However, I hope that the Minister is prepared to say—in fact, I know he will say it, because he always does—"We have had an interesting debate" I know that he will say that; he is that kind of man.<br><br>
The issue is important and I know that the Minister is serious; I know that he will consider the amendments and the spirit in which they have been tabled. He will say that he can work on them and that the idea of protecting our children is important. If we do that in the way that we suggest, by the controlled release of information—not in every case, but where there is a serious risk of someone reoffending—we can achieve what all hon. Members want, which is protect our children, provide better safeguards and move away from the failed policy of the past which was simply to dump those people into the community, tell no one and wait for them to reoffend. That is not satisfactory or acceptable. The amendments address those issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Greenway <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ryedale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am labouring under the effects of a heavy cold, which seems to get worse the further we delve into the Bill. The hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) frequently talks good sense in the Home Affairs Select Committee and the speech he has just made prompted me to get to my feet because it also contained good sense. However, there are questions that we need to consider. If we are to have the measure, the way in which information is disseminated and used to protect the public, particularly our children, as the hon. Member for Barrow said, is crucial. I get the impression that the Government have not made up their mind on that. It would be useful if members of the Committee conveyed clearly to Ministers what they feel about it.<br><br>
There are arguments for and against a code of practice. The argument in favour is that it lays out a framework that everyone can see and work to. However, one has to ask of what the code would consist. I would prefer to see a clearer picture of the code before coming to a judgment about whether it is a good idea. The question to which my hon. Friend the Minister should respond—I apologise for not knowing the answer myself—is what the consultation said about that. It has been clear from our deliberations thus far that a great deal of consultation and thought, across the political divide, have already taken place in drafting the Bill. It would be interesting to know how the consultation process developed thought on the issue, not just on the code of practice but on the key issue of how we disseminate information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He is right that we should tease out how the system should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
work. That issue is raised by the amendments and new clauses that we have tabled. One could put the question the other way, which the hon. Gentleman might like to consider. We must consider how information is to be handled, whether through a statutory instrument process that provides guidance or some other system. The danger is that it will simply be left to chance. There seems to be some meeting of minds across the Committee that there needs to be a reasoned way of dealing with the information that is required under the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Greenway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In many ways, the hon. Gentleman is right. There has to be a clear way forward, but that is still some way from saying that a code of practice is the solution. It is an issue which needs still to be considered and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister recognises the general mind of the Committee that the measures should have the impact and effect that we all want—as much a practical solution as a legislative framework. The amendment and the new clause suggest that the code of practice would be subject to the negative resolution or another secondary legislation procedure. That would be a practical way to implement the measures, which would be useful to society as a whole. I hope that my hon. Friend finds that helpful.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will allow my hon. Friend the Minister to consider the matter further, in consultation with all interested parties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. I do not like being provoked into making remarks, but I felt that I had to say that. I fully accept that we are debating an important and extremely difficult area.<br><br>
I can give a quick reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway). The consultation process did not throw up any information in relation to a code of practice; it dealt with the proposals that were being considered, but did not give much information on a code. I hope that, with the indulgence of the Committee, I can develop my thoughts and analyse some of the issues that concern me.<br><br>
I fully understand the desire of the proponents of the amendments to specify how information communicated to the police as a result of the Bill's provisions should be used and further communicated. The information in question is obviously highly important—to us and to potential victims, and, as I said this morning, it is critical to offenders because of the obligation imposed upon them to register.<br><br>
I remind the Committee again that the obligation to register is not itself a punishment. It is an administrative matter—which we believe is important—and results from convictions for certain offences. I shall mention later matters such as vigilantism, which is why I emphasise that registration is not a further punishment. The person concerned will already have been punished. If the obligation to register is a long one, perhaps a lifetime obligation, the punishment will already be severe. We should remember that.<br><br>
We all know that registration is highly sensitive. When answering the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham), I mentioned the matter of confidentiality, which applies in other areas. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0608">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
question is whether we can maintain confidentiality yet recognise the need to protect the public.<br><br>
We need to test thoroughly and carefully the contention that the police are able to use information acquired under the Bill in a sensible and effective manner. The police already have a database, which is extremely effective in gathering information to help them in their operational duties. Registration will give the police further information; even if nothing else were done, it would enhance the police's ability to perform their duties in protecting the public.<br><br>
We have no evidence that the police are anything other than scrupulous and careful in their use of information currently on the database, and we believe that they will be extremely scrupulous and careful with this further information. It will be a new and important source of intelligence for them. No doubt they will take steps to ensure that it is communicated and available in the operational context. At present, no such code of practice exists to tell the police their job in that respect.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
If we opted for a statutory provision or code of practice, we would have to be careful to avoid various pitfalls. Such a statutory instrument or code of practice could only relate to the information required under the Bill's provisions. It could only relate to those convicted of the sex offences to which the Bill's provisions relate. It could not deal with information relating to other sex offences nor to any other offences. Although sex offence crimes form an important aspect of police work and are matters about which we are especially concerned, they are only one aspect of police work. We would inevitably create a regime for that one aspect of offending, leaving other aspects unaffected. That might cause problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, I wanted to develop my argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that and I do not want to disturb the Minister's flow. I wanted to point out, however, that although amendment No. 9 and new clause 4 refer to information required under the Bill's provisions, new clause 6 makes provision for information to be tied in with the general work and other information involved in child protection. It is the police's expectation that such practice would arise from the Bill's enactment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's line of reasoning, which would extend the provision a little. The general thesis that we should take into account is that large aspects of police responsibilities, interests and information would still be unaffected—albeit if, as the hon. Gentleman has said, the terms of the new clause would extend further than the Bill's provisions. That might cause problems. We should be careful to ensure that, by creating a system in one area, we do not place into confusion police practice in every other area. After all, we are keen ultimately to give the police every possible encouragement and assistance.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale raised a point about a code of practice. We have completed a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
consultation process and, although there is an argument that such a code should be precisely worded, there is also a strong and compelling counter-argument that, for it to be of use, it should not tie down the Secretary of State too far by forcing him to cover matters that are better not covered or to omit matters that should be covered. It is a difficult problem. We would have to consider and address questions such as which statutory organisations should receive information. Should that be done routinely, or only in specified instances? What sort of public exposure should there be? Should only specific types of information be made available? Should that be provided proactively or, as the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness suggested, by means of a request? There would be risks in terms of public disclosure. As the hon. Gentleman said, there would be risks of vigilantism and paedophile networking, unnecessary public anxiety and the danger of compromising people. How far would police disclosure be a disincentive to register and drive some offenders underground? I agree that they would be committing offences, but there is a concern. In addition, would there be a need to divert police resources to protect named paedophiles from attack in such a situation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I just proceed for a moment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, I think that I may be able to help the Minister. He is listing precisely the concerns that we think need to be dealt with if the Bill is to be an effective measure. We tabled the amendments because the issues are not dealt with in the Bill. It is for precisely the reasons mentioned by the Minister—the difficulty of fine-tuning some of the issues—that we have suggested a graduation. We suggest that a statutory instrument deal with certain matters following consultation and, in new clause 5, that there be guidance. In that way, there will be a gradation between what is included in primary legislation, what is included in the statutory instrument and what is dealt with through guidance. In that way, we will have sensitivity on the questions that the Minister is now raising.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must realise that I am trying to make a comparison between police who work in an operational role and use the available information and the territory covered by the amendment—which is difficult to get into. All that I suggest is that the matter is difficult.<br><br>
As the Committee knows, we are actively pursing with the Association of Chief Police Officers the nature of the use that it would want to make of the information that it would require as a result of the Bill. Those discussions have not yet been concluded. We have asked about current practice in the disclosure and sharing of information and for the association's views on how far we should go towards a more systemised sharing of information with outside bodies or, indeed, the public. The association is taking consultations across the police forces and reflecting on the findings.<br><br>
I want to make it perfectly clear that—[<i>Interruption.</i>] If the hon. Gentleman can contain himself for a moment, I want to make it clear that I am not ruling out the possibility of a code of practice as an appropriate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0609">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
additional tool. The amendment is a paving amendment. Indeed, the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness said that he wanted to hear about principles. I agree that we shall probably not be able to go much beyond discussing the principle today, although we can air the difficulties and the challenges.<br><br>
I certainly undertake to reflect further on the form of the paving provision that might be needed to enable us to issue a code of practice that would not have the feared consequences that I have mentioned. I want to reflect very carefully on whether we can take that path without the unintended consequences that I described.<br><br>
I must also warn the Committee that any such measure would probably apply only to England and Wales. I am sure that the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) is aware that the exercise of issuing codes of practice to the police in England and Wales has been well-established since the enactment of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. There is no corresponding tradition in Scotland. Were we to pursue this route, my colleagues in Scotland would want carefully to consider whether to make similar arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have written to the Scottish Office and the Lord Advocate about the Bill and, only an hour ago, I received a reply to say that it was being considered. If the Minister could do something for me on the whole agenda as well as on this one, I would be extremely grateful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's feelings. I was a Scottish Whip for very nearly five years and I am sure that the Scottish Office and my ministerial colleagues there would want to consider very carefully the position as it may relate to Scotland. I merely warn the Committee that if we were mindful to take this route, it would be relevant only to England and Wales at present. However, I am prepared to do as I have said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts <span class='memberconstituency'>(Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: To assist my hon. Friend and the Government. I draw attention to a report in the <i>Western Mail</i> on 29 November last year, under the heading
<br><blockquote><p>"Schools name paedophile 'to protect pupils'."</p></blockquote>
The story is told of how a man was convicted of abducting and assaulting two 10-year-old girls. Description of the man, his car and his vehicle's number plate were passed to the director of education for Gwent by the Gwent police. Of course, the director took it upon himself to disseminate the information to schools. The schools, in turn, took it upon themselves to inform the parents. That sort of thing happened before the publication of the Bill. I draw my hon. Friend's attention to the example because, presumably, the police did no wrong in disseminating what they considered was information vital to the protection of children in-the area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I am sure that my right hon. Friend is right about that. It underlines once more the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
sensitivity of the matter. The co-operation and coordination that is already encouraged is certainly well developed when it comes to protecting the public. We must be very careful going down that particular route. As the amendment is an enabling amendment and we are not, I hope, required to discuss the details of any code today—that would be an invidious and impossible situation—I am prepared to confirm that I shall reflect further on the form of the paving provision that might be needed. On the basis of my willingness to do that, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Ann Coffey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister consult with his colleagues in the Department of Health? Earlier, he referred to the register as a necessary administrative function that would offer protection to the public—in other words, to children. As the Minister will be aware, the child protection procedures constitute a necessary administrative function that offers protection to children. I know that it is a difficult area and I impress strongly on the Minister that I do not think that it will go away. I would like to be assured that, in thinking about some of the difficulties, the Minister's discussion go further than consultation within the Home Office and its different responsibilities. The Department of Health carries a primary responsibility for the protection of children, which is the reason why we are discussing the Bill.<br><br>
I offer the Minister a particular example, which needs resolving through guidance. My hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) illustrated the problem eloquently earlier. If a man who was on the register because of a conviction went to live with a family that included two young children, the social services department would have a duty to protect the children and assess the risk. It would seem reasonable that it would be in possession of that information in order to carry out its duty and function in assessing children. Therefore, it is important that whatever consultation the Minister has, he is fully informed by his colleagues in the Department of Health of ways in which they might ensure that their duty to protect children and assess risks to children is also enhanced through the Bill.<br><br>
I would also like the Minister to think about how the information might fit in with the current registers—the Department for Education and Employment list 99 and the Department of Health consultancy list. Those registers also hold details of people who have been convicted, the aim of which is to give information to employers so that such people are not employed in places where there are children.<br><br>
I accept that such issues are considered elsewhere, but there needs to be coherency between the registers that are kept by various Departments to enhance the protection of children. I should be grateful for the Under-Secretary's assurance about that, because the issue will not go away. Setting up a register is an important step forward in helping the police to do their job. I am sure that the public will ask what the register means. It would not be unreasonable for them to do so, and they will probably be wanting an answer to that question before the Bill is debated on Report.</span></p>

<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot go a long way down the road suggested by the hon. Member for Stockport, other than to say that I have already explained that there is an enormous amount of interdepartmental and interagency co-operation. She seems to be asking whether all the information will be brought together on a centralised database or whether there will never be a time when information is held by one agency, but not another that may have some interest in the matter. I cannot give her such assurances today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Coffey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not suggesting the setting up of a central register. Under the Bill, people who have convictions will have to register their names and current addresses, and their addresses when they move. Does the Minister expect that information to be contained on the Department for Education and Employment's list 99 and the Department of Health's consultancy index? Surely we are talking about a simple matter of progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Lady, we are now considering a code of practice, although I made it clear that we would not be able to. I take on board what she said; as she knows, the multi-agency approach under the Children Act 1989 and the ethos that surrounds our consultative and legislative programme for the protection of children is essentially that we do our best to ensure that the agencies have the information they need and that they co-operate with each other. I cannot go further than that and I promise that such steps will be taken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's comments take me back to my original difficulty with the Bill. It covers only those who are convicted after a certain date or who are currently under supervision or under sentence. If the information is to be shared, it must relate to all paedophiles who are a danger in an area. It is no good saying that information can be released about some paedophiles, but not others. I wish to impress on the Under-Secretary the importance of sharing the information that takes account of paedophiles before and after the Bill is enacted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I explained at some length this morning why the hon. Gentleman's proposals are not practical. I congratulate him on having another go but, for the same reasons as I set out this morning, it is not possible for us to go back. Apart from anything else, the necessary searching and investigation and the resources involved in that process would make the whole exercise unsatisfactory. I cannot promise that the Government will have a change of heart on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misunderstands. I am trying to understand how information will be shared with other agencies. Clearly, the police will receive information under the Bill. They already have other information on the database. It is important that when information is shared with other agencies there are not two classes of it, one arising from the Bill and another arising in the normal course of police intelligence. It would not be much good if the area protection committee were told, "Yes, we can tell you the address
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
of this paedophile but we cannot tell you the address of that paedophile—we know it, but it isn't on our register."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are in danger of confusing the register that is implied in the Bill with, for example, the Department of Health index, of which I have some experience as a constituency Member of Parliament. I can assure the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East that a person does not have to have a conviction to be on the Department of Health consultancy index; all that must happen is that an employer must lay evidence with the Department. There is no appeal and a name cannot be removed from the index unless it is withdrawn by the authority that has laid the information against the person.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a most helpful debate and I thank the Minister for both the manner and the content of his response. The House of Commons is at its best when we are teasing out issues that concern our constituents and trying to end up with a piece of legislation that works. The Minister's response shows that he is listening to the debate and taking the issues extremely seriously.<br><br>
I want to make a couple of comments, which I hope the Minister will take on board in his further consideration. The general issue concerns the pressure for community notification or Megan's law or whatever title it is given—there is a danger in putting a label on something so that everyone thinks that they understand it when they do not. There is an underlying problem that people will be horrified by particular offences and say, "If the Government, the police and the child protection bodies won't sort it out, we will; if they're not going to get on with it, give us the information and let us do it." We need to ensure that Parliament has dealt with the issues, so that we can say to our constituents, hand on heart, "We have done our best to put the appropriate mechanisms in place and they will really work."<br><br>
There are dangers in giving both too much information and too little information. In some cases when information about individual offenders has been made public, nobody has been made more secure or made to feel more secure. People have not known what to do with the information and have quickly passed it elsewhere, asking, "What do I do with it? Let's get rid of it quickly." In his response, the Minister recognised the need to have in place a system that deals with the information and the protection of children. My difficulty is that, although the Minister recognises that need, I do not believe that the Bill does.<br><br>
I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) has had some difficulty in understanding who is legally and ministerially responsible in Scotland. The Minister can do little more this afternoon than to note that concern, but it would greatly assist my hon. Friend if, before the Committee meets on Thursday, he were to receive some answers to the factual questions that he was asked. As we have all said, we are trying to work together for the best possible objective.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Conwy (Sir W. Roberts) gave some indication of the nature of the problem. I was brought up in Colwyn Bay and Llandudno and am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0611">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
aware of the shock and honor at the death of Sophie Hook, which rocked that community. We have to ensure that we put in place arrangements that will address that shock and horror in a reasoned, sensible, calm but effective way. That is all we are trying to do and the Minister has given us credit by accepting that we have tabled paving amendments.<br><br>
Some questions have been raised about what should be in the code of conduct and we have suggested such a mechanism because we recognise that that those questions cannot be answered in primary legislation. The mechanism needs to offer a gradation so that some things are dealt with by statutory instrument—which everybody understands is of a secondary nature, but which is capable of adjustment—and other things are dealt with through guidance, as suggested in the later new clause. Some other matters can be dealt with through existing systems. We are merely asking for clarity, which is what we all want.<br><br>
The purpose of the Bill is for information to be provided to those who need it and for everyone to have the confidence that that will happen. I am confident that it can be done. The expectation of ACPO and others is that the information required by the Bill will be handled within the system for child protection on which the police have been working with other statutory bodies and voluntary organisations, such as the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. That is clearly the Minister's expectation, which is fine for information that is already on the police national computer and for information that comes to those experienced, who know how to use it. But what about information given to an officer at a local police station? The information will be on his desk and the responsibility is his. Chief constables have said that unless there is a clear framework on how to deal with that information, they would have to pass the responsibility on—a case of passing on hot potatoes. That is why it is so important that when making it a requirement in law for such information to be provided, we must ensure that it is handled as sensitively as possible.<br><br>
The Minister has recognised the importance of the issues and that we have tabled a paving amendment to allow those issues to be debated. The advantage of the statutory instrument procedure is that for those elements that can be decided in that way, we in the House of Commons and those in another place can accept responsibility for exercising our judgment. We cannot pass on the responsibility or leave it to the police to exercise their best judgment. That is not to call their judgment into question, but it is unfair to ask them to make judgments that are appropriate for Parliament to make.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman like to comment on the recent case of a housing officer in Birmingham who passed on information to a residents' association and was then in danger of losing his employment? I understand that the local residents very much supported the action taken by that housing officer.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I would not like to comment on that because it covers what the Minister was saying. We cannot make universal judgments on what needs to happen. We need to ensure that an individual does not have to put himself on the line because there is information that he feels he has to deal with in order to protect children in the local community. There must be systems in place so that he has the confidence that because that information is fed into the system, the right things will happen. I am confident that that is what everyone wants—including the Minister.<br><br>
I believe that the sort of framework that we have suggested would work. I shall not press the amendment to a Division, in view of the Minister's positive response. We should keep in the back of our minds the dangers of unstructured approaches or being pushed into ill-considered legislation. We must get it right ourselves. It is a responsibility that the Minister has made clear he is willing to take, and I applaud him for that.<br><br>
We may learn some lessons from the United States, including the need to be very careful because some problems have arisen from the way in which different pieces of the law have been implemented. Our culture, law, police service and other services are different. We should learn from that, however, that trying to get a consensus on the way to proceed and on effectiveness is the right way to protect children. I am sure that we would all agree that that is the objective. It is worth teasing out the issue and ensuring that we have a conclusion on Report. I am confident that the Minister will prepare himself for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not say that he has to tease anything out of me. I hope that that is not what he is suggesting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not; I did not mean that. I meant that we should tease out of the complex mixture of issues before us a solution that everyone will agree makes sense and will work. It is our responsibility to do that, not to pass legislation and hope that someone will make sense of it afterwards. I believe that the Minister has engaged with that and accepted that we all need to do that. In the light of his response, and in the hope that he will take those points on board, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 41 and 43.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments are intended to increase the penalty for failure to comply with the notification requirements to a level 5 fine—that is, £5,000—or a period of imprisonment, or both.<br><br>
Amendment No. 43 is consequential upon amendments Nos. 40 and 41. The penalty it imposes is stiff, and reflects the concern of the police and of child protection agencies that those convicted of a relevant offence should comply with the requirement. The consultation document, "Sentencing and Supervision of Sex Offenders", which was issued last summer, and to which I referred earlier, addressed the question of the level of penalty. We received a mixed response: the agencies that I mentioned sought tougher sanctions; others thought the proposed level to be about right. In the light of strong representations from a number of organisations, we have been persuaded that the level of penalty that the amendment will impose is required to ensure compliance with the notification requirement. I commend the amendments to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that we are all practising for different roles that we may occupy in the future, so I am happy to say that I welcome the amendments and accept them as improvements to the Bill.

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> that the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of incidents in Scottish society and the release six months or more ago of an individual called John Cronin, from Peterhead, who carried out a terrible rape on Judy, who appeared at a Scottish Tory party conference a few years ago.<br><br>
Ray Wyre, a criminologist, has said in a statement today that what is being done in the Bill, especially just imposing fines for non-compliance, is not enough and that certain individuals must be looked after, or returned to gaol; they need supervision, which is inadequate under the Bill. Ray Wyre, who has dealt with many sexual deviants in prison, has said that the Bill's provisions are inadequate. Given concern expressed in the community, I want to bring that matter to the Minister's attention—perhaps he will comment on it later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know Mr. Wyre and have spoken to him about such matters on several ocasions.

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us a little about how the certification system will operate? We have had no clarification of that, other than what is contained in the Bill. I should be grateful to the Minister if he were to help us because a reference to a certification process is rather dry as dust when it appears within legislation. It would be helpful to know what is envisaged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The effect of clause 5 is to make supplementary provisions relating to the certification of qualifying offences, to which the hon. Gentleman has referred. Where it is stated in open court that an offender has committed an offence to which the Bill applies and the court certifies those facts, the certificate can be used in evidence in any subsequent prosecution. Of course, that provision applies to people who are cautioned as well as those who are brought before the courts. That is basically what clause 5 does. The use of certificates as evidence is not obligatory; they are available, if necessary, for any subsequent prosecution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What will happen if a flaw in the process defined within the clause caused problems or unintentionally enabled people to avoid the Bill's provisions because of administrative error? The Bill is precise on how certification will proceed, but does that mean that there is a danger that people could fall through the net because of technicalities? Clearly, that is a matter of administration and procedure, but I seek reassurance about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is little more that I can say. It is an enabling measure. As to whether there might be a flaw in the procedures, I cannot say. I shall certainly investigate, to discover whether any flaw exists. If I find one, I shall let the hon. Gentleman know.<br><br>
As I have already said, the idea is to help with the proof. A person can be prosecuted with or without a certificate; it is not obligatory but, as extra evidence, it would certainly be useful in a subsequent prosecution.</span></p>

EXTENSION OF JURISDICTION: ENGLAND AND WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to say a few words. Clause 7 extends the jurisdiction of the criminal courts in the United Kingdom to sexual offences against children committed abroad by British citizens and UK residents. I wish to make it clear to the Committee that I personally feel strongly about that. I attended the Stockholm conference and challenged the attitude of others on the extradition of their own citizens—and, indeed, the competence of their courts to deal with such despicable and deplorable cases.<br><br>
The dual criminality test will, of course, apply. It is an important safeguard, in that a person's acts abroad must be punishable under the law in force in that country or territory. The offence must also constitute an offence under the law of the United Kingdom. The offences are listed in schedule 2. The presumption will be that the conduct in question constitutes an offence under the law enforced in that other country or territory unless the defence serves notice showing grounds that it is not. That is an important safeguard and certainly an important tool in this fight. In the Crown court, the question whether that condition is satisfied is to be decided by the judge alone.<br><br>
I wanted to speak about clause 7 because it introduces important matters. I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For a long time, we thought that some offences committed abroad should not escape the net in this country. I welcome the Minister's personal approach on that question. For a long time, there was resistance to it; it is good to know that we are now in agreement.<br><br>
There are some matters that need to be explored. I have tabled amendments, which we shall discuss on Thursday, to allow us to debate the list of offences that should be covered. Most of those questions can be dealt with better in our debates of the schedule rather than under clause 7, so I shall not delay the Committee tonight. I appreciate why the Minister wanted to tell us about the general principle of the clause, which we support.<br><br>
Subsection (5) allows the courts to permit the defence to
<br><blockquote><p>"require the prosecution to show that the condition is satisfied without the prior service of a notice under subsection (4)".</p></blockquote>
In the past, the Government have been keen that the defence should not be able to bounce the prosecution in particular circumstances. At first glance, that is what subsection (5) seems to allow. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain why. It seems odd to say that the defence must serve notice in advance and then to say that, even if notice has not been served, it might be required to produce that information. The clause seems
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
to contradict itself. I would be grateful for any clarification.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Drawing on my legal background and other things, I must say that the courts have a discretion to allow points to be raised without prior notice if they see fit. The provision mirrors earlier exercises in extra-territorial provisions. If the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth thinks that that raises new issues that tip the balance in the wrong direction, I shall carefully consider the point. If there is a need for any changes, I shall come back to him.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister is not attacking me for having missed this in previous legislation and, therefore, not allowing me to comment on it today. I am happy to leave the matter at that if the Minister will examine it and provide an explanation. It just seems that there is a slight tilt of the balance and a contradiction and I would be grateful for clarification, but I do not intend to delay the Committee on the issue.</span></p>

EXTENSION OF JURISDICTION: SCOTLAND</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the provision, which relates to Scotland. I know that you, Sir James, your colleagues and others in the House of Commons have been canvassing for moves such as this for years. I am pleased that the Government have introduced the provision. However, the Minister knows that the clause refers exclusively to Scotland, and I would like to take up conditions in schedule 1, with the latitude of the Chair, which apply to the clause.<br><br>
My questions are almost identical to those posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth about subsection (4) and the act of adjournal. Perhaps the Minister could explain the situation with that subsection which concerns the act of adjournal and the accused serving a notice on the prosecutor,
<br><blockquote><p>"stating that, on the facts as alleged with respect to the act in question, the condition is not in his opinion satisfied".</p></blockquote>
Earlier, the Minister made a point about the dual criminality test. If that is proved in a court overseas, what else is there to prove here?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One thing that I did not do was to qualify in Scots law as well as in law applicable in England. I regret very much at this moment that I did not. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's point is valid, but I wonder whether I might come back to him on it. I assure him that, were there any material problems in terms of the effectiveness of the clause, we would want to tackle them. If the hon. Gentleman does not mind, I shall return to him on the point.</span></p>

THE CHANNEL ISLANDS AND THE ISLE OF MAN</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the intention to use the power to extend part I of the Bill as suggested in the clause at the same time as the implementation of part I? I raise that simply because there is a need for consistency as far as possible across the jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The matter was raised earlier today—it seems an awfully long time ago—and I suggested then, as I must now, that the clause allows for part Ito be extended to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man by Order in Council. That does not mean that we immediately impose the provisions on the islands. Indeed, I understand that such matters work by the islands having some say. It is not a matter of our imposing that aspect of law on them. Without going into too much detail, I hope that the law is as widely and as successfully implemented in the United Kingdom as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
possible; we have already discussed Scotland in that regard. However, I cannot go further than to say that the clause allows that, by Order in Council, and that that is normal for such provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister go a stage further? Presumably it would be normal practice to alert those who take the first step of the need to consider that in the near future. With the Minister's comments, such an assurance would provide the reassurance I seek.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that that is the case. Those concerned are well aware of those matters and of the power contained in clause 9.</span></p>
