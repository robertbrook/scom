Special Grant Report</div> <!-- title -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Simon Burns)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Special Grant Report (No. 22) (House of Commons Paper No. 16)</p></blockquote>
May I say what a particular pleasure it is for me at this, my first Committee, to have you in the Chair, Mr. Jones? We go back a long time and even if I did not agree with the electorate's decision those many years ago, it enriched the House of Commons for you, rather than me, to be here at that stage.<br><br>
The report specifies determinations in respect of a grant that the Government propose under section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988. The persons from abroad children's grant has been determined by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health and for ease of reference during our proceedings, I shall refer to it as the children's grant. It is designed to assist English social service departments with their expenditure from 5 February 1996 to 31 March 1997 in providing support for children in need, when that duty arises in consequence of changes to the entitlement of asylum seekers to social security benefits, or to support from local authorities in connection with their previous duties to support homeless persons.<br><br>
The background to the report is that the Government recognised that withdrawal of benefits from certain asylum seekers could impact on local authorities expenditure. The Government, therefore, proposed providing assistance to social service departments following consultations by the Department of Social Security with the Social Security Advisory Committee and the local authoritiy associations, leading up to the reform of benefit arrangements for asylum seekers and other persons from abroad.<br><br>
As a result, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security deferred implementation of the changes from December 1995 to 5 February 1996. A further outcome of the consultation was that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security decided that existing claimants would be given limited transitional protection. Benefit would continue to be paid until an unsuccessful decison about an asylum application. At the time, my right hon. Friend gave a commitment to assist local authorities in England with any relevant additional costs that they might incur in carrying out their duties under the Children Act 1989 and homelessness
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
legislation as a consequence of the changes made by the Social Security (Persons from Abroad) Miscellaneous Regulations 1996.<br><br>
The Committee should be in no doubt as to the scale of the problem. Between 1984 and 1994, the United Kingdom saw a 10-fold increase in the number of people claiming asylum. Yet in the same period, the proportion of those succeeding in their applications fell from 32 per cent. to 4 per cent. It is clear that the availability of benefits and other help has attracted people who are not in fear of persecution but are seeking to improve their economic position. It is an abuse of the asylum procedure and the Government had to act.<br><br>
The changes that we made to the benefit rules in February were to focus on those with the strongest case for support from the taxpayer. Those who make their position clear at the outset will qualify for benefit while waiting for the initial decision on their application for asylum. Those who enter illegally, however, are denied benefit, as are those who enter by misleading others about their status and claiming to be able to support themselves.<br><br>
The Government remain committed to helping the genuine refugee and have introduced provision for backdated payments of benefits, enabling refugees to reimburse those who supported them while they were without benefit.<br><br>
Under section 17 of the Children Act 1989, local authorities have a general duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are in need within their area and, so far as is consistent with that duty, to promote the upbringing of such children by their families by providing a range and level of services appropriate to those needs. Section 17 duties are for children under 18 years.<br><br>
The Government have proposed the special grant to target compensatory funds to those local authorities with significant numbers of asylum seekers with children. The purpose of the children's grant is to provide compensation to local authorities for the unforeseen additional expenditure that they incur for the period from 5 February 1996 to 31 March 1997, in carrying out their duties under sections 17 and 18 of the Children Act. This is to support children in need and their families through support for the whole family or, when a child of 16 or 17 is without a family and is not already being looked after by social services, who are affected by changes in social security benefits and housing legislation for asylum seekers. The grant is to help keep the family together.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health has earmarked up to £25 million towards the grant, which will be available to all authorities in England that incur expenditure above the threshold and, therefore, qualify for grant support. Under the arrangements set out in Special Grant Report (No. 22), the children grant will cover 80 per cent. of the relevant expenditure incurred by local authorities above a threshold equivalent to £1 on council tax band D properties.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0113">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
The grant will also cover relevant expenditure incurred after 19 August 1996, when the order under the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 came into force, bringing housing authorities' duties under the homelessness legislation closer in line with the rules on eligibility for benefits.<br><br>
In drawing up the grant scheme for support for asylum-seeking families with children affected by the changes in legislation, the Government have been guided by three underlying principles. First, the grant should provide reasonable compensation for unavoidable, unforeseen additional expenditure to those authorities that are most affected by the costs of providing services for children under sections 17 and 18 affected by changes in legislation.<br><br>
Secondly, the grant should contribute to costs in a way that is fair on the basis of objective data and audited costs. Thirdly, the grant scheme should be clear and simple and not impose administrative burdens on claiming authorities that are disproportionate to the amount of money involved.<br><br>
The Government have responded to the concerns of local authorities in proposing this grant and I wholeheartedly commend the report to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.37 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Ann Coffey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This report sets out the arrangements for compensation for local authorities incurring extra expenditure on services for children in need as a result of recent legislative changes that moved entitlement to benefits and housing assistance from categories of people from abroad. It is an acknowledgment of the unfairness of local authorities having to pick up the costs of such changes. That acknowledgment is a start, but I regard the Government's response to the situation as inadequate and incoherent.<br><br>
At present, London boroughs are supporting some 700 families with children in various settings. That number is expected to rise rapidly as and when the outstanding asylum claims, including an estimated 13,000 families with children, are determined by the Home Office. No commitment has, as yet, been made to reimburse the expenditure on the adult asylum seekers affected by Justice Collins' recent decision that social services have a duty towards destitute asylum seekers under the National Assistance Act 1948.<br><br>
Local authorities have no control over the volume of expenditure, as the demand for services will be determined by the number of destitute asylum seekers in the country and the rate at which outstanding cases are determined. Local government did not seek the additional obligations for which it is incurring costs. The savings resulting from the new benefit rules introduced by the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 will give the Department of Social Security an estimated £200 million in savings and it does not seem right that part of the costs of the changes should be transferred to local government without compensation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
No costs will be recoverable under the threshold to be determined for each authority using the formula set out in the report. For London boroughs in particular, that will mean spending up to a maximum of some £130,000 out of their annual budgets without compensation. The Minister has wider responsibilities for community care and I remind him that that sum would fund carers of elderly people for 400 weeks of respite care. Above that threshold, only 80 per cent. of the cost will be reimbursed.<br><br>
The authorities under pressure are also capped, which inevitably means that other services will be affected. It is difficult to see how Government exhortations about financial planning by local authorities can be reconciled with the fact that the Government expect local authorities to pick up the costs of unplanned expenditure that has arisen because of their own inability to put competent legislation on the statute book.<br><br>
I have a number of questions to ask the Minister for clarification. The report says that grants will be paid to local authorities
<br><blockquote><p>"whose relevant expenditure … exceeds the threshold for that authority".</p></blockquote>
"Relevant expenditure" is then defined as
<br><blockquote><p>"reasonable expenditure properly incurred by a local authority in providing services for children in need, under section 17 or 18 of the Children Act 1989".</p></blockquote>
We may all think that we know what is meant by "reasonable expenditure", but I should like to know what the Minister thinks it means. Will he assure us that it includes housing costs for the family?<br><br>
Local authorities are currently in the process of setting their budgets for 1997–98. When will the Minister decide whether the arrangements set out in the report for the reimbursement of costs to local authorities will continue for 1997–98? Can we expect that decision to be made before the deadline for the legal requirement to set the budgets is reached? When can we expect a Government decision on reimbursement of costs to adult asylum seekers incurred as a result of Judge Collins's judgment?<br><br>
The Minister proposes to limit the grant up to the issue of a deportation order, but it can take the immigration authorties several months to enact deportation, during which social services will continue to be obliged under the Children Act to provide services to children and their families. Will he take that into account for future arrangements, or does he propose to amend social service responsibilities in that area? The Children Act requires social services to provide continuing support to young people, so why have the Government limited reimbursement of costs of services to children under 18? I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify those points.</span></p>
<p>4.42 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Gerrard <span class='memberconstituency'>(Walthamstow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, but certain points need to be made about the report, which particularly affects London boroughs covering areas such as I represent.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0114">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
I shall not go back over the arguments of principle. The Minister gave reasons why the Government introduced this legislation, but, like all my hon. Friends, I completely reject the principles on which it is based. That is not the subject of debate this afternoon, however, and we must concentrate on the issues raised by the report.<br><br>
The report will mainly affect London. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ms Coffey) said, several hundred families are already being accommodated by various London boroughs, and the boroughs have identified many of the families whom they expect to have to house at some point in the future. For example, there are 300 to 500 known families in Haringey, 150 in Wandsworth and almost 500 in Westminster—those are substantial numbers of families who will have to be dealt with. That means that local authorities will face unavoidable costs. They do not determine the rate at which people will come to them or the numbers of people they will have to deal with; those matters are entirely outside their control.<br><br>
I was interested to hear the Minister say that £25 million had been earmarked. Local authorities already estimate that they will have to find at least £100 million to deal with unaccompanied children, children and families, and destitute adult asylum seekers, who are not covered by this report. Can the Minister explain what will happen once the £25 million that has been earmarked is exceeded? When these measures were originally discussed, we were told that there would be savings of £200 million in the social security budget. So, as a result of the report, expenditure will be transferred from the social security budget to local authority budgets, but not all the money will be found from the proposed grant. Why should there be a threshold?<br><br>
I understand the argument that there should be a threshold because there is no need to worry too much about an authority that has to deal with only one or two people, but why should there be a threshold for local authorities that have to deal with substantial numbers of people? They might have to spend at least six-figure sums, of which 80 per cent. only will be paid under the grant. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport said, that will mean that many authorities—mostly London authorities that have had their budgets capped—will have to cut some other social service.<br><br>
Councillors and hon. Members who represent those local authorities will have to deal with constituents who come to us asking why they are not receiving community care, respite care, home help or some other form of social security that has been cut purely because the Government are not funding the extra expenses that local authorities are forced to meet.<br><br>
Can the Minister explain what is meant by paragraph 3 of annex A on page 4 of the report, which, in part, deals with what happened from 5 February to 21 June 1996. On 5 February, the social security regulations were changed and, on 21 June, the courts decided that what had been done was illegal, after
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
which the rushed changes to the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 that led to the report were made.<br><br>
It is being suggested that local authorities must try to recoup spending between 5 February and 21 June, on the thesis that some people will receive backdated benefits for that period. However, what does the phrase "reasonable endeavours to recoup" actually mean? What will local authorities be expected to do? It is seriously suggested that local authorities can get that money from people who have lived without money—in some cases, for several months—who suddenly receive backdated benefits? What will happen if local authorities cannot do that? I should be grateful if the Minister would explain what "reasonable endeavours" is supposed to mean.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport said, Mr. Justice Collins' scathing judgement has an effect. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"if Parliament really did intend that in no circumstances should any assistance … be available to those asylum seekers"—</p></blockquote>
adult asylum seekers—
<br><blockquote><p>"it must say so in terms. If it did, it would almost certainly put itself in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights and of the Geneva Convention".</p></blockquote>
However, local authorities must now pick up this bill as well.<br><br>
I am told that there are difficulties because different London boroughs are not sure what they can spend. Some authorities are paying for bed and breakfast, and others for bed and breakfast and some food. Amounts paid vary from £14 to £40 a week in different authorities. None of that is picked up in the report. Again, as a result of the Government's actions, local authorities will inevitably have to spend that money. I should be grateful if the Minister would tell us what the Government intend to do about that. Do they intend simply to have the report, which deals only with children, and to ignore the other problem, which could lead to substantial extra spending?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burns</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might help the Committee if I deal with that. As the hon. Gentleman will know, Collins' judgement and the issue of adult asylum seekers are beyond the scope of the report. To help him, I can say that the Government do not believe that that judgment was right, which is why we are appealing against it; we will not know until the appeal hearing whether the judges or the Government made the correct interpretation. It would be wrong to speculate about that now.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman may be aware that the Government are in discussion with local authorities on the issue of adult asylum seekers in the position to which he referred. We must continue those discussions to determine what happens; the result of the appeal will also have a major impact on where we go in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) resumes his speech, I emphasise that, while I have allowed flexibility in the debate, it should be centred on children and the grant.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0115">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerrard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Jones. We have strayed somewhat, but it is important to point out that there is a similar impact on local authorities' social services budgets.<br><br>
I am reassured by the Minister's statement that discussions are continuing, because a letter from his colleagues in the Department of Social Security to someone who had written to him gave a different impression. It said that there was no way in which the Government would be involved in picking up that part of the bill.<br><br>
I reinforce the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport about the difficulties in knowing what the limits will be. The Children Act 1989 requires that social services authorities continue to provide support to young people; it does not say that all responsibility towards them ends when they are 18. When young people come out of care, for example, it is expected that there will be continuing responsibility towards them.<br><br>
On what happens when a deportation order is put in motion, I have dealt with constituents who have had deportation orders and who have had to wait for months until any action was taken—either for a judgment to be made in their favour or for them to be deported. What are local authorities supposed to do in such circumstances? If the Government intend to reimburse local authorities for unavoidable expenditure, the order should take that into account. Because there is such delay in another Department's dealing with orders, local authorities are forced into expenditure.<br><br>
We need to know what will happen in future. Although the order deals with the current year, it would be helpful to know whether there will be similar orders in future years or whether the Government intend that the matter will be swept up in the standard spending assessments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burns</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to deal now with that point. What will happen in the next and subsequent financial years is part of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee negotiations. As the Committee will appreciate, I cannot give further information about that but I hope that the hon. Gentleman finds that helpful.</span></p>
<p>4.54 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike Gapes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ilford, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My constituency is in the London borough of Redbridge, which has a large number of refugees—approximately 4,500 according to a survey last year. That number is growing rapidly and many of those refugees are children. There are also people in our borough who, for whatever reason, have applied for asylum during the past five or six years but been refused and, after a tortuous legal process, in the past few months the number of deportations has increased.<br><br>
A constituent came to see me last week. He had lost his appeal to stay and, on second appeal, the adjudicator, while upholding the original decision, recommended exceptional leave to remain on the ground that the man requires kidney dialysis on alternate days. He has young children. The effect of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
regulations will be that he will lose his housing benefit and income support, and is liable to be evicted from the house, one room of which is used for storing the dialysis machine. Will the Minister say whether the regulations would allow exceptions for special circumstances such as those I have mentioned, or are they limited strictly to the terms laid down?<br><br>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Minister for Walthamstow who outlined the problems facing local authorities. If the sum available is to be limited to £25 million, what will happen when local authorities face pressures? After all, where people choose to live is not yet subject to Government diktat. Because of the nature of the housing stock or due to family or communication links, many local authorities—especially some London boroughs—have received a disproportionate number of these people. London boroughs such as mine—Redbridge—which, traditionally, have low social service expenditure, but are capped, will face such pressures, but, as yet, there is no indication that Redbridge council will be given the necessary support to cope with growing pressure on its social services departments and other pressures resulting from educational demands and the like.<br><br>
The proposals are a classic example of buck passing, an inadequate, belated and mean-minded attempt to pass the bulk of the burden on to local authorities. The Government, in claiming that resources are being made available, are thereby absolving themselves of their responsibility. That will add to the problems. There are already tensions between pressed inner-city communities and among ethnic groups and asylum seekers, and people claim that resources are being provided to those groups at a cost to them. We know this because constituents come to us making these accusations. Unless proper provision is made for local authorities in such areas, the pressures and tensions will become worse. I ask the Government to rethink their formulas and their £25 million limit and make resources available to local authorities when and where they need them to enable them to tackle the problems.</span></p>
<p>4.58 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The benefit changes that led to the special grant are already causing immense hardship, as my hon. Friends have said. Three weeks ago, I visited the Newham refugee centre in my constituency. I met a number of people who legitimately seek asylum and who are not allowed to work because they have been in the country for less than six months, but who are not entitled to any benefit. As a result, they are destitute. The Newham centre is appealing for food for such people. I am not talking of half a dozen people; there are well over 100 destitute people in Newham and the number is growing rapidly. Mr. Justice Collins in his judgment said that he could not believe that Parliament had intended people to be left destitute. But that appears to be what the Secretary of State intended; he was certainly warned that that would be the effect of the proposals that he brought before the House—and that is what has now happened.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
For children, mercifully, the local authorities have to step in. Like my hon. Friends, I am concerned about a number of the details of the grant. I am very worried about the figure of £25 million. The local authorities' estimate is £100 million and, like others, I wonder what will happen when the figure goes over £25 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burns</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might help if I put the hon. Gentleman out of his misery. It must be made clear that the grant of £25 million is the best estimate of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health of the money required, but the grant is unlimited. We can spend more if the facts and eventualities demand it. That will address the point that the hon. Gentleman is making and the point made by the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes). While I am on the subject, it may help the hon. Gentleman if I told him that in the case of his constituent, if exceptional leave were to be given to that gentleman he could claim social security benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I again remind the Committee that the scope of the debate is narrow: It refers to the grant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that helpful clarification. I wonder whether I could raise with him a further question about what is included within the relevant expenditure to which the grant applies. In particular, will the full costs of administration and assessment for each affected child and each affected family be included at 100 per cent. within the relevant expenditure that is defined in the document?<br><br>
In London, 700 families or households with children are already being accommodated by local authorities because of their responsibilities under the Children Act 1989: 120 of them are in my borough in Newham. I fear that it will not be long before facilities in places such as Newham, Redbridge, Waltham Forest and Westminster are shut down by the local authorities to create the funding to pay the costs arising from their statutory obligations to asylum seekers. The proposal before us goes nowhere near far enough to deal with the problems that local authorities are facing.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eltham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. May I ask my hon. Friend the Minister whether he will arrange for a parliamentary answer as and when the Collins judgment has come up for appeal so that if judgment continues to go against the Government the House will know how the Government propose to deal with that issue. May I also ask him whether he will make some arrangements, either with the Home Office or his Department to keep in contact with voluntary groups that are caring and coping with those who do not come within local authority jurisdiction?<br><br>
Although the House has made a decision—I will not repeat the views that I offered in the debate—it is important that the Government should know about the activities of the agencies that are caring for those who are at least on the borderline, if not well within the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
margin, of those who should receive support because their destitution justifies it and who had some reason for not declaring themselves on arrival as refugees. The Government will not necessarily have to accept what they are told by the organisations that are paying, but, just as they are closely in contact with local authorities, they should be closely in contact with those groups, including the Church groups and the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture to find out how they see the situation developing.<br><br>
None of that deals with the primary issue of whether the total number of refugees and those who might qualify under the report can be affected; that issue is for a separate debate, and few would argue that it is right to restrict the great numbers who come here and apply for refugee or asylum status. However, we expect the Government to be informed by a knowledge of the situation. For those who are not in the hands or care of local authorities and are not receiving benefits from local authorities or national Government, Ministers should be able to give some assurance that the Government are, in one way or another, in contact with groups that, on behalf of society as a whole, care for those who need help.</span></p>
<p>5.5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burns</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a helpful and useful debate. I assure the Committee that I have listened carefully to concerns from Members on both sides on individual cases and on issues relevant to them.<br><br>
I dealt with a number of issues as the debate developed. That seemed the most relevant way to seek to answer questions. I shall use my remaining time to deal with issues raised by the hon. Members for Stockport and for Newham, North-East (Mr. Timms) and by my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley).<br><br>
On the questions put by the hon. Member for Stockport, it might help the Committee if, briefly, I explain more about expenditure. To the hon. Lady's direct question, I can answer yes, it includes housing costs. To the question about administration costs put by the hon. Member for Newham, North-East, I hope that he finds it reassuring—though he may not totally agree with my view and the Government's—that, within the 80 per cent. grant, an element of up to 10 per cent. is set aside for administrative costs.<br><br>
On what will happen after March 1997, I have already said that that is a matter for PESC negotiations. Hon. Members will understand why I cannot go any further on that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stockport mentioned the Collins judgment. I have alluded to it briefly, but will point out again that the Government do not share the judges' interpretation of the National Assistance Act 1948. That is why the Government are going to appeal; we shall have to await the outcome of that. I can give the assurance that the Government understand local authority concerns and are consulting authorities.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Eltham asked whether a parliamentary question can be tabled immediately the Collins judgment is known. I cannot give that assurance, not because I want to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0117">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
unhelpful, but because we do not know at this stage what that judgment will result in. It would be extremely foolish of me on 5 November—when the case may not be heard until the new year—to give a categorical assurance that as soon as we know the appeal's result a parliamentary question will immediately be put down. I can assure my hon. Friend that we treat the issue seriously and, depending on what the judgment is, we will act as quickly as possible when we decide how to take the situation forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful. The situation may be that the appeal court will decide that the Government could not have in mind what the Government proclaim is in their mind. If that is the case, I think that it would be judged unlikely—I am looking ahead—that the Government would then want to say that they asked Parliament only to legislate for what was in their mind rather than for what the judges said was actually in their mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burns</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have every admiration for the parliamentary tenacity of my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham, but I am going to disappoint him by not allowing to have teased out of me what may or may not be the Government's thinking. Frankly, it is too soon. A mere, humble Parliamentary Under-Secretary such as myself is not in a position to be able to debate that in greater detail in this forum at this time. I hope that my hon. Friend will forgive me on that score.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gyles Brandreth <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of Chester)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very judicious.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burns</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stockport also asked what would happen following the Collins judgment. That was a hypothetical question, rather than a specific request as to what the Government would do. Of course, I can only repeat that the answer will depend on the appeal against the Collins judgment. However, presumably—I hope that I am not giving any hostages to fortune—if any amendment to social services is required, we would have to consider that seriously.<br><br>
The hon. Lady finally mentioned the limit of under 18, that is 16 or 17-year-olds who might be unaccompanied children in Britain. I think that I understood her question correctly—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Coffey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall ask it again in a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burns</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I understood the hon. Lady's question about the limit to under 18-year-olds. Responsibility under the Children Act 1989 is for children who are not in care—that is, a very few children who will be 16 or 17 years old. That is the purpose of the limit.<br><br>
I have already, answered several of the issues raised by the hon. Member for Walthamstow. He also asked about local authorities recouping expenditure and what exactly that meant under section 3 of the report. It would be up to local authorities to ask asylum seekers whether they had been paid backdated benefits. If they had, and they still had the money, they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
could either pay it back to social services or, if they did not want to do that, social services would not need to support them.<br><br>
This measure is a step forward. The Government have listened to the points raised by the local authorities about families with children and have come up with the scheme set out in the report, which I believe to be a relevant way to try to deal with the problem. I strongly commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>5.12 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Coffey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister a little further? I requested clarification about reasonable expenditure. I thank the Minister for stating very clearly that it includes housing costs, but he did not respond to my request for clarification on what he regarded as reasonable expenditure. As he will know from sections 17 and 18 of the Children Act 1989, the promotion of children's welfare includes a wide range of issues. It is important that the matter be clarified because "reasonable" is a good word, but one often surrounded by dispute. I would be grateful for clarification on that.<br><br>
I am pleased that there are continuing discussions with local authorities about carrying on the current arrangements contained in the grant for 1997–98, but all local authorities are in the process of setting a difficult budget and it would be helpful if those discussions could be concluded as quickly as possible.<br><br>
My specific question concerns the arrangements to limit the grant until the issue of a deportation order, although it takes the immigration department several months to enact deportation. That is what my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is open to individuals who are subject to a deportation order to comply—they do not need to wait until they are taken to the aeroplane.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Coffey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that is quite right, but I am not concerned with the rights and wrongs of that issue. I am concerned about the welfare of the children who are affected. Social services departments continue to be obliged, under the Children Act 1989, to provide services to children in need and their families. My question to the Minister concerned the reality of the matter. In making arrangements for grants, will he take into account the continuing responsibilities that local authorities must discharge under the Children Act, or will he relieve them of their current responsibilities under that Act to promote children's welfare? That is an important issue.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gapes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister for clarification of his remarks about exceptional leave to remain. As I understand the present situation, in a case such as I described earlier income support would be stopped because an appeal had been lost. Housing benefit would therefore be stopped automatically by the local authority because it would be informed by the Benefits Agency that income support was no longer being paid. The consequence would be that in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0118">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
period between the decision to refuse the appeal but to recommend exceptional leave to remain, and consideration of the matter by the Home Office—and those of us who deal with immigration cases know that that process can take months—the family, including any children, would be destitute.<br><br>
Where compelling reasons exist for recommending exceptional leave to remain on medical grounds, special provision is needed. What provision is made in those circumstances for assistance to adults and children? We have heard that the children could be assisted, but it they were about to lose the family home and one of the parents had a serious medical condition, would an attempt by the local authority to assist be allowed? Would that be a breach of regulations? Could the local authority obtain recompense, restitution and reimbursement?<br><br>
It is all very well for the Minister to say that if exceptional leave to remain is upheld the family will be entitled to social security benefits, but what is to happen to those people in the five, six, seven or eight months of the interim?</span></p>
<p>5.17 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman has outlined—although clearly a problem for the individual family affected—is not as big or as widespread a problem as the overall issues that we are dealing with today. It should be possible to think of other arrangements besides bringing in the whole panoply of Government to support the local authority in making decisions whenever someone applies for exceptional leave on medical grounds. In a matter involving relatively small numbers, it should be possible to cope through voluntary or community effort or local authority co-operation.<br><br>
I must tell my hon. Friend the Minister that it is in the nature of Committee discussions for hon. Members to raise the problems that concern them—as I did earlier. On the point about the briefing provided to members of the Committee, especially by the Association of London Government, I have to say that the system of reimbursement is right. The threshold is relatively low and the 80 per cent. element is correct. There is always a tension between specific grants and block grants to local authorities. On the whole, it is like a sine curve or a tide going up and down; too much fluctuation can be avoided by trying to stick to the general rules. By going above a certain threshold and meeting four fifths of the cost, partnership between national Government and local government is kept about right. I support that general formula.</span></p>
<p>5.19 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burns</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Several hon. Members have raised further issues and some have pressed me further on matters that were raised previously, I shall try to clarify those points.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
The hon. Member for Stockport raised the question of what is reasonable expenditure. I will give a broad-brush answer. Quite simply, it is what a local authority auditor would regard as reasonable. I hope that the hon. Member for Stockport is satisfied with that.<br><br>
As the next point is beyond the scope of the report I shall be brief. The hon. Lady made a plea for the discussions to be concluded as quickly as possible. It is in the interests of everyone for the discussions to continue for as long as is necessary, provided that the issues are sorted out quickly. However, I cannot put a time scale on that.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Stockport and for Ilford, South raised the issue of deportation. The legal position is that after all the legal processes involving deportation have been exhausted, no grant will be provided to local authorities if they continue to provide funding. One point in the case made by the hon. Member for Ilford, South slightly confused me. I take on board that he was referring to a constituent with children, but he gave a time scale—it may have been hypothetical—of four, five, six or seven months until the appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gapes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, until the decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burns</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry—until the decision. However, if a constituent developed an illness that may have resulted in his being considered, under exceptional circumstances, to be allowed to remain in this country, presumably he would have made an application immediately. Before we get into really deep trouble, I must make it clear that I am referring to a hypothetical case because I do not know the hon. Gentleman's constituent and I cannot stand here as the arbiter for all decisions on the asylum status of constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gapes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The constituent had the medical condition to which I referred, which is why the adjudicator recommended exceptional leave. The case did not develop suddenly; it was part of an on-going process. My question remains—what happens in the period between an adjudicator recommending exceptional leave and a Home Office Minister making a decision to uphold it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burns</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that further elaboration. I think that I have the answer, although it may not altogether satisfy the hon. Gentleman. There is nothing to stop a local authority paying or making financial provision for an individual, but it will not then get that money back from the Government under the scheme. That is the straightforward answer to where the money could come from to put a roof over a family's heads.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Coffey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to be absolutely sure of what the Minister is saying. I would like clarification on social services' continuing obligations under the Children Act 1989 and on the legal postition that the Minister outlined. Under the Children Act, social services will continue to be obliged to provide services to children in need within families and the provision for such services may continue for several months after the deportation order has been served and all the appeals
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0119">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
have been exhausted. Is the Minister saying that those social services departments will not be reimbursed for the duties that they have legislative obligations to carry Children Act? Is that the position?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burns</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
