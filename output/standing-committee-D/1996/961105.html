	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Angela Knight)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Open-Ended Investment Companies (Investment Companies with Variable Capital) Regulations 1996.</p></blockquote>
The regulations are being introduced under the European Communities Act 1972 to provide for the establishment in Great Britain of a new type of body corporate falling within the scope of a European Union directive. Separate regulations will be introduced to enable the formation of open-ended investment companies in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Union directive in this case is the 1985 directive, co-ordinating the provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities. It is known as the UCITS directive. It is a single market directive for collective investment schemes in which investors' money is pooled and invested in a way that spreads risk. Although the directive provides that schemes may take the form of open-ended investment companies, the only United Kingdom based schemes able to take advantage of the marketing passport have been authorised unit trust schemes. That is because there is no provision in United Kingdom law for open-ended investment companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much business has been lost to Luxembourg and to Dublin because of the difficulties of marketing unit trusts offshore. One of the main reasons for the regulations before the Committee is to enable British investment companies to catch up with their offshore competitors by enabling them to compete on a level playing field with the rest of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a long and thorough period of consultation about these regulations for what are commonly known as "OEICs". That may not be a particularly elegant term, but it is certainly unforgettable. The Treasury first consulted with policy proposals in 1984 and followed that with further consultations about draft regulations in 1995. The investment fund industry has responded constructively with comments and I am grateful for their thorough and careful consideration of the issues involved. A number of adjustments to the original proposals have been made to reflect messages from those consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations for OEICs establish the main elements of a separate corporate code for the new type of investment company. The regulations are the first
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
part of a package of measures to allow the formation of OEICs in Great Britain. OEICs will not be formed under the Companies Acts, because that traditional route is not appropriate for what will be a regulated collective investment scheme. However, a number of familiar concepts of company law are contained in the OEICs code and they are blended together with other features from unit trusts. For example, OEICs will have annual general meetings, shareholders will have the right to approve the appointment of directors and, if necessary, will be able to sack any of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like an authorised unit trust, the OEIC will be authorised and regulated by the Securities and Investments Board under powers granted to it by Treasury regulations. Those powers are similar to those in the Financial Services Act 1986, under which the SIB regulates unit trusts. SIB regulations for OEICs will be the second part of the package of measures and will supplement the European Communities Act 1972 regulations to complete the code for OEICs. The SIB has consulted extensively about its proposed regulations during 1995 and earlier this year in parallel with the Treasury's consultations. A near final draft of SIB regulations was published for further comment on 22 October.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third part of the package will be tax regulations to be introduced shortly by the Inland Revenue. The tax regime for OEICs will be broadly similar to that for authorised unit trusts, and the tax regulations will also provide some relief from stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax for authorised unit trusts that convert to OEICs. In addition, the Government have already announced that the next Finance Bill will introduce relief from stamp duty for other mergers of authorised unit trusts for a period of two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An OEIC's business is investment in securities, such as the shares of other companies. It will issue shares to its investors and its capital, like that of authorised unit trusts, may go up or down as shares are issued or cancelled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assets of an OEIC—the shares that it owns—will be held by a depositary, who must also be authorised under the Financial Services Act 1986. The depositary plays a key role that is similar to that of the unit trust trustee and he or she must be legally independent of the directors of the OEIC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The independence requirement is an important feature of investor protection and reflects a clear message from virtually the whole investment fund industry during consultation. Each OEIC will have a board that may consist of a sole authorised corporate director or several directors. Promoters of an OEIC will have a choice about whether to appoint independent, non-executive directors. That important flexibility was introduced following consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An OEIC with a sole corporate director can be effective, like a unit trust with its fund manager. At the same time, many OEICs and, indeed, many investors may see advantages in a board with a number of directors, some of whom might be non-executives. When a board has more than one director, SIB regulations will require one to be an authorised corporate director.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
The OEIC will be a modern, flexible and transparent investment product. Regulators will supervise all its activities. The OEIC and its key players must be authorised under the Financial Services Act 1986.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Investors in this country will find a new product that is simple to understand, and has key features that are disclosed more clearly than ever before. They will have an opportunity to widen their ownership of shares without the burden of managing a diverse portfolio. Its corporate form will make it attractive to overseas investors too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been careful throughout to maintain a balance between flexibility and a high standard of protection for investors. The regulations for OEICs introduce a new and forward-looking stimulus to collective investment schemes in this country, and I believe that, from 6th January next year when the regulations, if they are approved by the Committee, are due to come into force, they will enhance the City of London's reputation as a centre for excellence in financial services. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.36 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Warwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition accept that OEICs are desirable vehicles for enabling the City of London to expand its influence in international financial markets. Therefore, we support the broad concept of OEICs. We retain doubts and anxieties, however, about their detail and especially their implications for consumer protection. There is no opportunity to amend the regulations and we therefore seek reassurances from the Minister. I shall put a series of questions to her and I hope that she can provide information that will enable those who wish to use OEICs in future to do so with confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concur with the Minister's view that OEICs are desirable. It is important to enable the City to respond to changes in the international markets. There is a growing OEICs market in Dublin, Luxembourg and the Channel Islands. The City must be able to respond to the demand for OEICs, but suitable protection for investors must exist. The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds helpfully set out in its brief the extent of the growth in OEICs, especially in Luxembourg and Dublin, in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote from that brief, if only to emphasise the importance of the City and the financial services industry, which employs 2.8 million people and accounts for 18 per cent. of our gross domestic product. Every Government should ensure that the City has the ability to compete effectively in international financial markets. The statistics show how many United Kingdom-based investment companies have moved to Dublin and Luxembourg and that is a matter of concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Luxembourg and Dublin have a 22 per cent. share of the European funds market. That figure has increased from 12 per cent. in five years. The United Kingdom share of the market remained more or less static in that period at just over 10 per cent.—it dropped 15 per cent. in the late 1980s. Funds under management in Luxembourg and Dublin have quadrupled, while
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
those under management in the United Kingdom have nearly doubled. The combined assets of United Kingdom fund managers in Luxembourg and Dublin increased from $3.3 billion to just under $20 billion between 1992 and 1995. In 1995, 63 per cent. of Dublin business was undertaken by United Kingdom fund management houses. In 1994, 757 funds from other European countries were notified to the United Kingdom authorities as being marketed here, but only 114 United Kingdom funds were similarly notified to the authorities of other European Union member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of OEICs is to allow the United Kingdom to benefit from the employment opportunities and associated benefits provided by having funds as well as asset management established and accounted in the United Kingdom. As the Minister pointed out, OEICs also provide opportunities for individual shareholders to spread risk in the ownership of shares without encountering the many difficulties that can be presented when individual shareholders have to manage a complete share portfolio.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
OEICs have been welcomed by the industry. A survey in June of Britain's 100 largest unit trust management companies by Coopers and Lybrand showed that 47 wanted to set up OEICs in the near future and that one in five would convert existing unit trusts to OEICs. OEICs may well replace unit trusts in years to come. Indeed, the Treasury might be aiming to encourage that by reducing stamp duty in relation to such conversions. Can the Minister confirm that that would be the Treasury's intention and, if so, explain precisely why that process is being encouraged?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
OEICs will also provide benefits for investors by trading at one price and replacing what is, to some of us, the somewhat obscure bid and offer pricing structure of unit trusts. Slightly more controversially, it could be argued that OEICs are pro-European—unit trusts are almost unique to Britain and the United Kingdom wants to open the financial services single market in Europe. OEICs are, therefore, a welcome pro-European policy from a Eurosceptic Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put some of the Opposition's anxieties to the Minister; some of them are quite important. The incidents at Morgan Grenfell concerning Mr. Peter Young and various unit trusts might well have implications for how those trusts operate in Britain. The extent of the implications and the detail of what happened is as yet unclear, but it might become clear fairly soon as reports come out. Would not it have been better to try to ascertain the difficulties in the current set-up before proceeding with a new type of financial instrument, which might replicate some of the problems of the Morgan Grenfell-type unit trusts? Why would it have caused problems to delay for a few short months to enable completion of investigations into the Morgan Grenfell incident and to ensure that any lessons to be learnt were learnt before introducing the new financial mechanism?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
Why is there no obligation for non—executive directors to be on the board? In her opening comments, the Minister said that there were advantages in non—executive directors and so there are. Increasingly, non—executive directors in Britain have been expected to play a supervisory role, protecting the investor. Why is that not necessary in open—ended investment companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the depositary, who performs a similar role to that of the trustee in unit trusts, provide enough protection for investors? We must ask that question because the problems at Morgan Grenfell have raised doubts. Such doubts might prove to be unfounded. It might be found that it was not the regulations that were at fault, but the means by which they were complied with. That remains to be seen, but we need some reassurance from the Minister that there is sufficient protection—it seems that the trustees were insufficient in the Morgan Grenfell case and if Deutsche bank had not been behind Morgan Grenfell, investors might have lost out heavily. Trustees appear to have provided little practical protection. Is the Economic Secretary sure that the risks being taken in introducing this depositary mechanism are sufficiently covered by the proposals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Thursday in another place Lord Mackay said that the depositary plays a key role similar to that of the unit trust trustee. Indeed he does. Can the Minister confirm that the depositary will have all the fiduciary obligations of a trustee? Will she confirm that at least all those fiduciary obligations are present in the new role, given that it is set up under an entirely different mechanism more similar to company legislation than traditional trust law? How far do we need to go beyond the traditional fiduciary role?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Mackay said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is unfortunately the case that no system of regulation can entirely rule out the possibility of fraud or mismanagement, but it is important to set high standards of protection for investors."—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 31st October 1996; Vol. 575, c.513.]</p></blockquote>
I agree with that and I hope that the Minister can reassure us that that is the case. May we also seek reassurance that, once the Morgan Grenfell inquiry is complete, any additional protections that are brought forward for unit trusts will also be brought forward, at the same time at the very least, for OEICs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was somewhat concerned when reading the debate in another place that Ministers were almost seeking to have their cake and eat it over the Morgan Grenfell case. Various reassurances seemed to be given that the preliminary conclusions of that case—it was stresed that they were preliminary conclusions—had few implications for the proposals for OEICs. They are indeed preliminary in terms of their outcome and I therefore find it difficult to see how the Minister can say with confidence that it is unlikely that Morgan Grenfell will have any implications. Perhaps we could clear up the issue of whether the preliminary results from the inquiries that have so far been undertaken have any implications for OEICs. Either they do or they do not. If they do not, will the Minister accept that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
there is no guarantee that when those inquiries are completed there will not be some implications which have to be taken into account?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Mackay set out the various roles of the depositary. He or she is responsible for ensuring that the OEIC complies with the Securities and Investment Board's regulations on pricing, investment, borrowing powers and income allocation. If there is an authorised corporate director the depositary has a duty of oversight over that ACD to ensure compliance with the regulations that relate to the protection of investors. Those onerous duties go beyond the role that trustees have so far felt they have had in relation to unit trust. Will the Minister spell out the process for authorisation of the depositary and his or her qualifications? How can the depositary ensure the ACD's compliance?
	<br><blockquote><p>"must be an authorised person".</p></blockquote>
We want to know precisely who can become an authorised person. That is a bit more than the qualifications. Who would the Minister consider to be a suitable authorised person? Under regulation 5(2)(b), the depository can entrust
	<br><blockquote><p>"to a third party all or some of the assets in its safekeeping"</p></blockquote>
or can authorise
	<br><blockquote><p>"the third party to entrust all or some of those assets to other specified persons."</p></blockquote>
What does that really mean? It means, it seems, that the depositary can pass assets on, perhaps to the bank. Or, perhaps it means that the depositary can pass them to a third individual, who may or may not be authorised. What are the authorisation procedures or qualifications for that third, fourth or even fifth party, to whom the assets may be passed? What form of protection is there for the consumer in this context?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the assets were held by a depositary or a third party authorised by the depositary, what would happen if those assets were frozen in the event of insolvency, such as happened in the Barings case? Only last week Sir Andrew Large set out a programme of work that needed to be done to ensure that senior managers of investment firms understood the compliance requirements. His view was that there were still problems. SIB clearly believes that there is work to be done. Does the Minister agree and, if so, what work is needed? Will she assure us that that will have no bearing on the protection for investors in OEICs? If it does have some bearing on that, will she report to Parliament on the implications? I want the Minister's assurance that she will, at the first opportunity, place before Parliament a full report of any implications, in relation to the Peter Young affair, for OEICs and unit trusts. The corporate government aspects of both—but particularly of a new instrument such as OEICs—must be right. People need to have confidence. If they think that the provision has not been passed by the House in a proper fashion, confidence in OEICs will be lacking from the start, and that would be undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Morgan Grenfell matter arose from difficulties in relation to unlisted securities. What measures will guarantee that the same problem will not happen in relation to OEICs? The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds has called for voluntary restraint on

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
the holding of prelisted securities. Does the Minister agree that that is desirable and, if so, why do the proposals contain nothing, or insufficient provision, in that regard? What means will exist to enforce limits on the holding of unlisted securities, and what means will be used to value unlisted securities held through OEICs? We know that the Morgan Grenfell unit trusts were supposed to be low risk, but they became high risk, in a sense, through unlisted holdings. Why are there no rules to give investors further protection in relation to that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not know all the implications of the various tax proposals that may come from the Government. Will the Minister be as candid as she is able in the circumstances? Parliament should have as much information as possible about the costs involved in this matter and, in particular, the tax implications. I hope that the Minister can confirm her answer to a written question 9 May, that she intended to include OEICs in
	<br><blockquote><p>"an exemption for conversions of an authorised unit trust into an OEIC or a single sub-fund of an umbrella OEIC."</p></blockquote>
She continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The regulations will also contain an exemption from stamp duty and SDRT, for a period of some two years, for conversions which involve a merger, such as the conversion of two or more authorised unit trusts into a single OEIC or sub-fund, or the merger of an authorised unit trust with an OEIC.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>We also intend to introduce legislation in the next Finance Bill to exempt mergers between authorised unit trusts from stamp duty and SDRT if the merger is carried out after the Bill becomes law and within a period of some two years thereafter."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 9 May 1996; Vol. 277, c. 204.]</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister confirm that that is still the intention and, if so, will she set out clearly the thinking behind it, and the reasons for the Treasury's view? I am interested in the policy implications and the Treasury's long-term objectives in adopting that tax policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on to bearer shares. At present, if a person has a share in a company, that share will be registered. But there will be no need to register all shares in relation to OEICs, as Lord Eatwell said in another place last week. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am aware that bearer shares are common in many European countries and are not unknown in this country, particularly in some pre-war legislation. But their use was discontinued in this country, not least because they were a potent means of tax evasion. Introducing them into the heart of the financial services industry is contrary to the entire thrust of British companies and financial legislation for the past 50 years. It introduces a clear and present danger to the integrity both of financial institutions involved and of the fiscal system."—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 31 October 1996; Vol. 575, c. 515.]</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister comment on Lord Eatwell's observations, which express important concerns? I think that they deserve a rather more detailed answer than the noble Lord received on the day on which he made them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the implications if nobody is registered as the owner of shares? Who might the owner be? Might the owner of bearer shares be a Nick Leeson, or a criminal, or some undesirable person with whom a potential investor might not wish to be involved in an OEIC, or in any enterprise? What investigations has the Treasury undertaken into the potential use of bearer shares for money laundering by criminals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Those are serious questions, which the Minister must deal with. I accept that because considerable numbers of OEICs are available in Luxembourg, Dublin and elsewhere on the continent there is arguably a money-laundering facility available to those who wish to use it. But surely we must be concerned not to create more opportunities for that behaviour? What safeguards and reassurances can the Minister give to ensure that that does not happen and that such matters have been looked into in the required detail?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister ensure that, in moving forward, the Treasury takes a view on whether it is desirable that OEICs should become involved in using bearer shares? Whether or not to use bearer shares is a matter for the OEIC. It may decide not to use them. Is the Treasury view that the use of bearer shares will increase in this country as a result of the regulations? If so, by how much? Does the Treasury think that the preponderance of shares for OEICs will be registered shares, not bearer shares? If so, to what extent, in the Treasury's view, should we be conscious of the implications of bearer shares for the future of the UK financial services sytem?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made a series of points on which I hope the Minister can provide some reassurance. In principle, we think that there is enormous potential for OEICs and that they are desirable. However, the assurances that we have asked for today would mean that those who seek to invest in OEICs in future may well be able to do so with greater confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I listened with interest to the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien). I say only that the apparent commitment of new Labour to the virtues of efficient and well-ordered financial markets and of the virtues of the European Union and its single market is desirable and that it is to be hoped that it is more than skin deep. I cast no aspersions on the sincerity of the hon. Gentleman, whom I know well from our joint service on the Select Committee on the Treasury. I do not doubt that he believes all that he says.

It was not so many weeks ago, however—you, Sir James, were in the Chair at the time in other proceedings in this very Room—that a colleague of the hon. Member for North Warwickshire referred in the same breath to both the international capital markets and the European Union's single market as a conspiracy of international finance capital. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Well, from time to time the nasty teeth of international socialism have a way of poking through the curtain of apparent urbanity and pragmatism that we have been shown today. However, I do not think that the British public will be deceived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is more, a slightly closer look at the comments of the hon. Member for North Warwickshire, who attempted to demonstrate a responsible concern for the health of those markets and even a desire to come to grips with some of the relevant issues in a sophisticated way, will reveal the old socialist attitudes again. There must be more restrictions on bearer shares, he suggested, saying that we cannot allow these new-fangled things and that we must revert to state control. He questioned what the Minister is doing about stopping all that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way when I have finished the paragraph. I remind the Committee that all financial markets worthy of the name on the continent of Europe consist of bearer shares. The whole Euro market is based on bearer bonds or bearer shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman is suspicious of bearer bonds and bearer shares, he had better go back to the real socialism that no doubt lies beneath the skin of Opposition Members and close off this country completely from the big wide world and its financial markets. The Government opened the door. We eliminated exchange controls in 1979 within a few months of winning power. It is now possible for any British resident to purchase any shares or other financial assets anywhere on God's earth. That has happened for many years as part of the sophisticated savings portfolio of investors in this country. Regardless of whether they hold their assets directly or through pension funds or insurance companies, they have many possibilities and will benefit from them through savings, incomes and pensions in the future. It is part of a healthy City that we be fully a part of that market. To impose restrictions on bearer shares being traded in the City or held in open-ended investment companies, or by residents here, would be to return to the bad old days of Sir Stafford Cripps. Perhaps that is what Opposition Members would do if ever they were able to deceive the British public into giving them the opportunity to take over the reins of power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even that paragon of new Labour, the hon. Member for North Warwickshire, who gave an interview in a newspaper recently in which he tried to demonstrate yet again how frightfully sophisticated new Labour intends to be about these matters, let slip his guard and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
gave us a small indication of the real character of the beast opposite. I now give way to the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not now. I have forgotten what I wanted to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that, having heard me through, the hon. Gentleman thinks that his intervention is superfluous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have felt for some time that there is something thoroughly unsatisfactory about the way in which the House of Commons reviews statutory instruments. I refer to the arbitrary, last-minute selection of hon. Members for service on Statutory Instrument Committees. Even more unsatisfactory is the fact that hon. Members do not receive papers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister referred earlier to a consultation exercise. I have no doubt that the Treasury conducted a thorough and effective such exercise, but we have seen none of the results. Consequently, we have not been able to take into account this morning any of the views that were expressed by interested parties. I regret that I wish that we adopted in these Committees at least the procedure undertaken in European Standing Committees, over which you, Sir James, preside from time to time with such distinction. On those occasions, we receive from the Government what are considered to be directly relevant papers to our forming a view on the subject under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, I regret that we do not have the ability in the Committee to amend the statutory instrument. As a result, our proceedings are not taken as seriously as they should be and much legislation is not properly considered, and some of that legislation may be bad. We are not able to do our job on behalf of those who sent us here. Such matters must be taken up, and I shall do so in a more appropriate forum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have said is a necessary pre-condition to what I am about to say, which is that had I been at liberty to recommend an amendment to the statutory instrument that we are discussing this morning, I would have done so. I am not convinced by something that my hon. Friend the Minister said in an otherwise extremely able and reasonable speech, which was that it is sensible to provide for an OEIC to be run by a single corporate director. That is a terrifying prospect. It must be common ground among Conservative Members that there is an optimum trade-off between regulation and freedom in financial markets. If there is too little regulation and markets are too anarchic and seen to be open to abuse, manipulation, fraud and insider dealing, investors will be discouraged and there will not be a successful financial services industry. A right balance must be struck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I recognise that there may be cost advantages for many fund-managing groups by setting up an OEIC to be run by a single corporate director, there could not possibly be in such circumstances a sufficient measure of balance and checks between the fund manager and the single corporate director. It is important that fund managers feel that they are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
directly accountable to someone and that someone is asking them questions. I am not saying that that person should necessarily be directing their choices, but asking questions such as, "Why are you overweight in Japan? Why do you have all those unquoted shares in your portfolio? Why do you like this particular company rather than that particular company?" Explanations need to be asked for and insisted upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any reputable fund management business should provide not merely for more than the one corporate director to whom the fund manager reports—as foreseen in my hon. Friend the Minister's structure—but for at least one independent non-executive director. I am glad that several unit trusts in the City have decided voluntarily to implement that principle and have appointed non-executive directors to their boards. That is the right action to take; those non-executive directors have a special responsibility to ensure that fund managers are properly accountable to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes the system within groups breaks down. The hon. Member for North Warwickshire raised a case which has rightly received much media attention recently. I am sorry that it concerned my old firm of which I was a director on the main board—Morgan Grenfell. In those days, it was a distinguished independent merchant bank. It has subsequently been taken over by the Deutschebank. I have nothing against the Deutschebank; it is a fine and extremely reputable organisation and, in many ways, the merger has been extremely successful. It was certainly not the fault of the Deutschebank what occurred in Morgan Grenfell's asset management subsidiary. Without prejudicing any investigations that the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation and others may undertake, it was clear from facts outlined in the press that there was a failure of control. That was an understatement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not enough people were asking sufficiently tough questions and insisting on clear and satisfactory answers. It is a central element of any properly managed fund management organisation to assure investors and savers that their interests will be properly looked after. If we do not have sufficient measures of protection, we will discourage investors and savers. There will not be the effect on the aggregate savings ratio that we seek by offering the public the additional instruments, and we will not encourage people to put their money into equity-type instruments or funds containing equities of the kind that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course I shall not vote against the statutory instrument. I am thoroughly in favour of the idea that there should be open-ended investment companies in this country—that has been a clear lacuna in our system for years. One of most successful fund management organisations in Europe is the Robeco Group and it is extraordinary that there has been no equivalent in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Investors have had the choice between a unit trust or an investment trust. In the case of a unit trust, the bid and offer are spread, usually by about 5 per cent.; that is a relatively onerous spread, which deters many
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
investors, especially because there is considerable difficulty in following the net asset value or movement of the prices from day to day. The investment trust is an exciting play precisely because one can usually buy equities at a net asset value discount, but that can also deter certain investors; there is additional reward and play, but also an element of additional risk. There is no reason why there should not have been open-ended investment companies in this country and it is about time that there were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not vote against the statutory instrument. Indeed, I applaud my hon. Friend the Minister for introducing it; it is not her fault that it has not been introduced before, as she has not been in the Government for long. I am not satisfied, however, by the governance aspects and I hope that, in the light of the recent Morgan Grenfell and other scandals, my hon. Friend the Minister will be persuaded to think again, even at this 11th hour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies), I am reminded that what I had to say could not be put in an intervention. We have heard admonitions against quoting, but I am sure that it is in order to use an historical quotation. Disraeli said that Gladstone was
	<br><blockquote><p>"inebriated by the exuberance of his own verbosity"</p></blockquote>
and gifted with an egotistical imagination, which he could not at all times control, to malign his opponent and assist his own glorification. I think that Disraeli was trying to point out the contradiction in Gladstone's argument; the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding first maligned my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) and then agreed with him by calling for non-executive directors on boards and speaking against single corporate directors. At least Labour Members are now trying to be consistent and I hope that I shall be consistent in supporting my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire in his concerns about the statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not now. We are discussing a Bill masquerading as an Order. It contains 75 regulations and it should be debated on the Floor of the House, not referred to a Standing Committee on statutory instruments. It makes fundamental changes to financial practice in this country. Some of the measures were abolished because the Government suspected that they allowed fraud and abuse of the financial system, but now they are being reintroduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hearing the Minister use the workd "OEICs" so fluently, I am reminded that "oiks" used to be a term of abuse, but I know that, as a Conservative, the Minister is used to them. I make a serious point, however. In the report of proceedings from the other place, the words "SIB" and "OEIC" are used, but the fact that "OEIC" stands for "open-ended investment company" is not spelt out. The report is written for

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
people who are used to the jargon, but that is unfair. 	<i>Hansard</i> is supposed to be a record of proceedings that the public can understand, so we should always make it clear what the initials of such words stand for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the most memorable days of my life; no one has ever compared my gifts as a Parliamentary orator to those of Gladstone.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with some of the points that the hon. Member for North Warwickshire made—he was right to make them—but I profoundly disagree with the tendency to regulate and to say, "Something could possibly go wrong; there could be tax evasion or criminal holdings, so we must wind up the market, close down the entire show and protect the British public from the international capital markets." That criticism is entirely fair, and it demonstrates the profound difference between our approach to regulation and that of the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That underlines the point that I was making. These regulations deserve to be debated on the Floor of the House, rather than in interventions made in a few months in a Statutory Instrument Committee—a ridiculous way to deal with something so important. The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding should consider Barings and what happened with Mr. Leeson. The public do not want us to reduce regulation; they want controlled, flexible and developed financial markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I did my degree at university, I was taught by Professor Andrew Bain—a gold medallist at Cambridge and a director of the Bank of England. Thirty years ago, he was in favour of having an open market and of changing financial institutions. But he wanted a regulated market, not one that ran amok. Significantly, he resigned from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission when the Government refused to accept the recommendations of the board on which he sat. Although he was appointed as a Conservative member, he resigned from the commission and the party because the Government were out of control. The Government are introducing measures that are not properly regulated, and we and the public will pay for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland, there is a strong, growing financial market, of which we are proud. A new financial sector is being built in Edinburgh, which is welcome. Those of us who look at Europe are concerned that, if we are not in the single European currency, that new financial sector might be seriously damaged because the companies now in Edinburgh will have to go where the market for the euro will be found. If we are not in the single currency, that will not be in Britain; it will be in Frankfurt. The Labour party must examine more closely such matters and, I hope, produce a more pro-single currency policy. Of course, that is the way that we are going.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We must be concerned about some of these measures, contained in a Bill that is masquerading as regulations. There are some serious concerns about depositary chains and the fact that they can pass on their responsibilities to other people. There are concerns also about the reintroduction of bearer shares into British financial markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I visited the World Market Company—an excellent small company in Edinburgh—which analyses information on the movement around the world of investment funds and trusts and sells that information to those who have funds to invest. More than 400 graduates work there, in a completely new sector of the Edinburgh financial market. I shall return to that company and ask in detail what it thinks about the initiative that we are discussing. From my conversations with it, I think that it would not necessarily be happy with the idea or bearer shares being passed round British markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, bearer shares were taken out of the British market a long time ago for a reason. Their reintroduction must cause concern, mainly to those who worry that such shares will be used for fraud and as a method of laundering drug money or hiding where money that should not be in the hands of certain individuals goes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must be concerned about having single corporate directors. I agree with my hon. Friend the Minister for North Warwickshire and with the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding that it is a bad approach, and to take it in a statutory instrument makes it even more dubious. These matters must be debated because they represent a fundamental change in the way in which people's money is handled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will management and administration charges be worked out? It is suggested that such matters will be dealt with much better than in trusts because there will be a single price. But the problem, especially for the bottom level of investor in private pensions, was that pension or investment funds were front loaded, which meant that the companies running them took most of the money in administration charges. That was out of control by the time that the Government, and others, realised what was happening in the pensions market. What guarantee can the Minister give that that will not happen here? There appears to be nothing in the regulation to stop open-ended investment companies taking small investors' money, using it to run an empire and getting back on to the fat-cat trail of champagne and caviar lunches, which were notorious
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
as a symbol of Mrs. Thatcher's Britain in the 1980s. There are serious questions to be asked about this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about SIBs for OEICs, which I thought sounded like a medical treatment, but she actually meant a control mechanism. What control mechanism will SIB apply to the front-loading of management and administration charges that will protect the public? Without answers to those questions, the regulation is seriously flawed. This measure should have been a Bill and given serious scrutiny on the Floor of the House. It shows that the Government are running out of control when they introduce a 75-clause Bill and call it a regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to answer the important points raised as briefly, but as fully, as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) for accepting the importance of the arguments in favour of OEICs. He quoted some interesting figures showing what is happening in Luxembourg and Dublin and I shall add more which show the necessity for a collective investment scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The percentage export to foreigners of OEIC investments from Luxembourg is about 86 per cent., from Dublin it is about 76 per cent., but from the United Kingdom it is only 6 per cent. The United Kingdom offers unit trusts; Luxembourg and Dublin offer OEICs. That is despite our natural advantage in investment management; interestingly, or perhaps tragically, much of the investment advice on the funds that are run from Dublin and Luxembourg is given in the United Kingdom. That shows more clearly than anything else the need for open-ended investment companies and our need to ensure that this competitive investment vehicle is in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) accused me, rightly, of using the term OEICs rather a lot in my opening remarks. I remind him that I said "open-ended investment companies" three times before I said that they were colloquially known as OEICs. I appreciate that such matters tend to be discussed in jargon by those involved in financial services, which is why I gave the full term three times before using the acronym.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Anxieties about investor protection are best considered together; many such concerns stem from the Morgan Grenfell matter, of which we are all aware. It is not possible to give definitive answers about Morgan Grenfell at this stage, as the investigations
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
into what went wrong and what will be the consequences are still under way. It appears that investments were carried out in ways that tried to circumvent the unit trust regulations. Among other things, for example, the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation will try to discover whether internal management controls over those running the funds in question were adequate. However, if the Morgan Grenfell investigation dictates that changes need to be made to regulations governing unit trusts, those changes will also be made to OEICs. It is important that the lessons are not just learnt, but implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) made several points about stamp duty, unit trusts and OEICs. In my earlier remarks, I set out clearly the details of the stamp duty regime for merging unit trusts that convert to OEICs and for unit trusts that merge and convert to OEICs. The unit trust industry wants to be sure that those who wish to amalgamate are free to do so and that is why we have stamp duty relief. There is evidence that the industry believes that some of its trusts should have been amalgamated but were not because that was not cost-effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason for the regulations is that, should the unit trust industry wish to convert some of its unit trusts to OEICs, it can do so without a financial penalty. It is not for the Government to decide what the industry should do in that regard, but it is for us to ensure that whatever route the industry chooses is tax neutral in regard to stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax: measures that I announced earlier this year. Some of the changes to the stamp duty reserve tax regime can be effected through OEICs regulations, but the merger of two unit trusts that remain a unit trust will be legislated for through the Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) and Opposition Members on corporate structure. We discussed, reflected and consulted extensively on the issue and received a strong message from an extended consultation process that flexibility in regard to corporate structure is necessary. The Treasury regulations therefore allow an OEIC to choose the corporate structure most appropriate to its circumstances. Some OEICs may choose to have a sole corporate director, who must be an authorised person; others may prefer, and investors may find it attractive, to have something more akin to the investment trust model, with a majority of independent directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed corporate governance for OEICs will deliver high standards of investor protection, whatever model is followed, not least because every OEIC has to appoint an authorised depositary that will hold the assets, which provides a second check on the system and the fund management. That check will be useful in terms not only of advice and undertaking compliance but of the insurance of investors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not persuaded that the provision of a separate depositary even begins to address the issue that I raised on corporate governance. There are two basic ways in which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
investors in an OEIC can be defrauded: first by the malversation of share certificates—something that the Maxwell pensioners suffered from dramatically a few years ago—and a separate depositary is a protection against that; and, secondly, the danger, of which Morgan Grenfell is probably the most spectacular example, of fraud or mismanagement by the fund manager. I repeat to my hon. Friend the Minister that it is not satisfactory to have a single corporate director, an employee of the same organisation, supposedly acting as a check on the fund manager.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No system can give perfection. If one tried to achieve such perfection, the industry would fail because it would be too tightly regulated. It is essential that we have a reasonable amount of checks and balances and good quality regulation, in which people can be confident. My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding must consider the shareholders. OEICs have shareholders, who have rights, such as approving the appointment of directors, including the authorised corporate director. They have rights such as the approval of certain alterations to the constitution of OEICs and proposals for mergers. In many ways, this particular investment vehicle has more checks and balances than those covered so far in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the Minister has not fully dealt with the point made by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies). It was said from the Front Bench in another place that the depositary has an obligation to ensure compliance by the authorised corporate director. How is that job supposed to be done by the depositary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to the matter of the depositary later, but I shall discuss it now, to answer the hon. Gentleman's question. The responsibility and, indeed, duty of the OEIC depositary are clear. The first and most important point is that the depositary must be entirely separate from the authorised corporate director. SIB regulations set out the details of duty and responsibilities, and the assets of the OEIC are entrusted to the depositary for safekeeping. The depositary will be responsible for ensuring that the OEIC complies with SIB regulations on pricing, investment, borrowing powers and income allocation. The depositary also has a duty of oversight of the authorised corporate director to ensure compliance with those regulations and relevant provisions of the instrument of incorporation that relate to the protection of investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding asked whether a depositary really can oversee a company's behaviour in a meaningful way. Of course it can. After all, a depositary holds the OEIC assets and oversight is a matter of adequate systems of monitoring and control. The OEIC annual report is required to contain a report by the depositary to shareholders, which must indicate whether, for example, issue, sale, redemption, cancellation, calculation of the price of the OEIC shares and the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
application of the OEIC income have been carried out in accordance with SIB regulations and, where applicable, ECA regulations. It must look at the investment and borrowing power and whether any restrictions applicable to the OEIC have been exceeded. I believe that that is a very extensive secondary check on the proceedings. The draft regulations were published by SIB and they make appropriate and interesting reading. I believe that they will help cover some of the points that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of the depositary, which was a matter touched on by the hon. Member for North Warwickshire, is not more extensive than that of the trustee. It is explained in great detail, and I have referred to that already. The authorisation of the depositary will normally be via IMRO, and that confers an authorisation under the Financial Services Act 1986. If there is a sub-delegation to a third party, trustees can do that under strict SIB rules. Trustees or the depositary remain responsible. These are a coherent set of regulations that give the appropriate balance between ensuring that there is proper security in the system while enabling the industry to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic Secretary said that the obligations on the depositary are no more than those on a trustee of a unit trust, but then said that the depositary has to ensure the compliance of the ACD with the SIB rules. The rules are quite detailed and having to ensure that an organisation complies with them on a day-to-day basis is an onerous task. How will that be done? Will it be left to the depositary to decide how to do it? What mechanisms will be put in place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to answer for the management of particular companies. However, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that they will be the requirements under the OEIC regulations, and those involved—SIB, IMRO and those who wish to be depositaries—will have to comply with the regulations. Those regulations have already been discussed at considerable length with the industry, and those involved will have to comply with the Treasury regulations and with the draft regulations from SIB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need to ensure that systems are in place. In fact, the current rules for unit trusts require there to be a unit trust manager and a trustee. Those individuals must meet their own requirements, and I suspect that some of the concerns raised by the hon. Member for North Warwickshire are a consequence of the Morgan Grenfell case. That is why I said that the lessons learnt from that case will be applied not only to unit trusts, but to OEICs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many other points were raised, but, as I shuffle my papers, it appears that I have lost the list of questions which I noted. I believe that the next question was what would happen if an open-ended investment company's assets were frozen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not entirely convinced about the role of the depositary. The Economic Secretary was right to say that the Morgan Grenfell case raises issues, but let us not go into that. Will the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
Economic Secretary tell us how involved the trustee for unit trusts should be in ensuring that the day-to-day compliance procedures within a company are appropriate and are in accordance with SIB or IMRO rules? As I understand it, such a trustee does not have that type of detailed role, and it seems that the regulations for OEICs go further than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On OEICs, I refer the hon. Gentleman to the regulations themselves. Schedule 2 outlines in some detail the role of the depositary, how he or she is appointed and so forth. If the hon. Gentleman reads the schedule, it will answer many of his questions on the depositary's role. These regulations have been in the public domain for a considerable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trustee involvement with unit trusts, the questions of what did or did not happen in the Morgan Grenfell case and whether the trustee's overseeing was of the sort that we should want to expect are matters that are being considered as a consequence of the current investigation. We cannot prejudge the outcome of that investigation. I cannot speculate: all will be known in due course. I am hopeful, as are many others, that the investigation will not take too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the assets of an OEIC are frozen, they are held by the depositary on behalf of the shareholders. The hon. Gentleman also asked whether we proposed to make any changes to the regulations for unlisted securities as a consequence of the Morgan Grenfell case. Again, we must await the outcome of the investigation, but the unit trust industry took an important step in deciding that it needed a voluntary code, to which all its members are being asked to sign up, for prelisted and unlisted securities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding answered the bearer share question in great detail, and I thank him for that. Although I shall not quote him directly, Lord Alexander made similar points in another place when it debated this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearer shares are popular in continental Europe, and it was thought that United Kingdom competitors would be at a disadvantage without them. We have heard just how much we are at a disadvantage compared to Dublin and Luxembourg, and we do not want to put our industry at an even greater disadvantage. The use of bearer shares in many European states is well established—more often than not, it is the norm. Unit trusts in the United Kingdom can issue bearer units, so common sense dictates that there should be parity between OEICs and unit trusts. In practice, however, bearer units are rarely used in the United Kingom market and we do not expect bearer shares in OEICs to be used often in the domestic market. It is an option available to the OEIC to enable it to prosper when it sells to overseas investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East expressed anxiety about money laundering. That important point was raised during consultation. I assure the Committee that there are a number of protections against abuse in the United Kingdom. Money laundering regulations require financial institutions to establish systems and procedures to detect money laundering and facilitate its prosecution. British
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
OEICs and their authorised corporate directors will be subject to those regulations. Other EU member states have introduced similar provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that bearer shares may make such procedures more difficult to enforce?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily. If they were going to be popular, bearer units within the United Kingdom would already have taken off, given the strength, depth and size of our unit trust industry. I do not envisage that bearer shares will be significant players within the British market. Our money laundering system works very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding was concerned about the availability of information to Members of Parliament. We considered that matter carefully. It is important for all who have an interest in such matters to have access to the information and to form their own conclusions. I assure my hon. Friend that all responses to our consultation have been placed in the public domain. On two occasions, we invited members of the Treasury Select Committee and members of the Committee that considered the Finance Bill to the Treasury for briefing. Sadly, no one came. However, by issuing such invitations and placing information in the public domain, I hope that we did as much as could reasonably be expected to ensure that people had opportunities for full and frank discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a reason for the particular route that we have taken today. It was theoretically possible for the Treasury to have waited for time to be available for primary legislation. However, it is not in my gift to say when that time would be. As unit trust industry urgently requires the sort of development of the OEIC that would enable it to compete in the ways that we have already described, it seemed appropriate to use the secondary legislation route. We ensured that there was a long consultation period so that no one felt disadvantaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
OEICs may mean change, but we have to make that change. Some may say that "OEIC" stands for, "Oh 'eck, it's changed". It is one effort for international competitiveness. I hope that I have answered all the questions that have been asked. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has a couple of questions still to answer. I am not entirely convinced about the obligation upon the depositary to comply with SIB rules. The second schedule contains several references to statements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"by depositary ceasing to hold office",</p></blockquote>
but there does not seem to be much to oblige depositaries on a day-to-day basis to be responsible for compliance by an OEIC with SIB rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister could write to me to detail any difference between responsibilities for trustees of unit trusts and for depositaries with regard to OEICs. Perhaps she could deal in more detail with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
compliance obligations on the depostiary, particularly within an ACD, which seems to be a considerable obligation on the depositary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the voluntary code on unlisted securities was important because of concerns raised. If there are such concerns, why do no rules go further than a voluntary code?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot recall the Minister dealing fully with one other matter: entrusting a third party with the safekeeping of all or some assets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dealt with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that she dealt with that. I am afraid that that passed me by. I should appreciate it if she would deal with it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Knight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will write to the hon. Gentleman on the depositary question. I also refer him to part VI of the SIB regulations. If the hon. Gentleman was concerned, it might have been a good idea to have taken up one of the invitations we put out to Members of the House of Commons to discuss the matter at the Treasury before today's meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On third party sub-delegation, I gave the answer earlier to the hon. Genetleman that authorisation of depositary will normally be by IMRO, which controls authorisation under the Financial Services Act 1986. Sub-delegation to a third party can be done under strict SIB rules. The trustee or the depositary remains responsible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
