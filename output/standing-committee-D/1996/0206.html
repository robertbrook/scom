	<p>[SIR JAMES MOLYNEAUX 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Sex Offenders Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Minister wishes to clarify certain points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Timothy Kirkhope)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Sir James. Before we embark on our debate this morning, I wish to clear up one or two points that arose on Tuesday and about which I undertook to come back to the Committee as soon as possible. The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) asked whether amendment No. 32 was necessary. It made clear that, when notifying a change of name, all other names that had been previously notified must also be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can confirm to the hon. Gentleman that that change in the drafting is to put beyond doubt that references to providing notification of changes of name are required for all subsequent changes of name, not just a change of the name given at the time of conviction. In connection with that, the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) asked about registration provisions for children in Scotland and England. The requirement is for their names to be registered for any period that might apply following a conviction for a registrable offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) asked me to explain the position concerning the act of adjournal and the accused serving a notice on the prosecutor under clause 8(4). I shall not detain the Committee for long, but I wish to explain that technical point. Subsection (4) proceeds on the basis that, if an act carried out in a foreign country constituted an offence under the law of the country and would constitute a listed sex offence in Scotland if done there, for the purpose of the Scottish prosecution there is no need to establish that the act was an offence under the foreign law unless the accused gives notice that he requires the prosecution to establish that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dual criminality test will not have been established overseas. It requires to be satisfied as part of the Scottish prosecution. The approach is to deem it to be satisfied unless the accused requires the prosecutor to show that it is satisfied. Under the Bill, the prosecutor ought to be satisfied that the dual criminality test had been met before bringing the prosecution. However, subsection (4) gives the right to the accused to test that point. Under court procedure, the accused must give notice that he wishes the dual criminality test to be examined. The act of adjournal merely prescribes the time limit for serving such a notice. It would then be for the court to decide the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>REGISTER OF SEX OFFENDERS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>".—(1) It shall be the duty of the National Criminal Intelligence Service to maintain a register of the information supplied to the police under this Act.</p>
	<p>(2) Nothing in the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 shall prevent the retaining of details of a person on a register maintained under the provisions of this section.</p>
	<p>(3) In this Act, 'register' includes data stored (whether or not with other data) on a computer database from which the information to which subsection (1) above relates can be retrieved.".—[	<i>Mr. Michael.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want, through the new clause, to fill a gap in the Bill. I am not suggesting that its wording is perfect, but I hope that the Minister will acknowledge the need for arrangements to be put in place that will make it clear what organisation will be responsible for information and systems that are consequential to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 3 states that it should be the responsibility
	<br><q><p>"of the National Criminal Intelligence Service to maintain a register of the information supplied to the police under this Act."</p></q>
As the Committee will appreciate, there was a comparatively short time between the Bill being discussed on Second Reading and it being debated now in Committee. As a result, we had only a short time to consult widely on the arrangements that would be most appropriate under the Bill and to table amendments to it. We want an organisation that could be responsible for the strategic handling of information nationally and ensure that arrangements were in place to enable such information to be used at a local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One option was the National Criminal Intelligence Service, which collates and disseminates intelligence information at a national and international level. Such an organisation will be more appropriate once the arrangements proposed in the Police Bill—soon to be considered by the House—come to bear. That Bill will create a body to which NCIS will be accountable, a body that will include representatives of local police authorities and chief constables. However, some senior police officers have suggested that NCIS may not be the most appropriate body, because it is removed from the day-to-day responsibilities of policing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another option is to treat the organisation merely as one which handles information, in which case the committee that overseas the work of the police national computer might be the relevant body. However, although that body includes various police representatives, it does not have a strategic overview. The question of who should be responsible is therefore still unanswered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other options. I should be interested to know whether the Minister has thought the matter through. One option is for the committee with oversight of the inspectorate with the day-to-day responsibility for child protection to consider the availability of information and how it is handled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we must ensure that the method of handling such information is not designed to satisfy
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
those primarily concerned with the computer system but those who wish to use the information. Many hon. Members will, I am sure, have known exactly what they wanted out of a computer system, but sometimes have been told that they must suit the requirements of new technology and those who programme the equipment rather than the equipment and the software being the servant of hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that that information, how it is handled, how it is made available and how people are alerted to it or to changes in it should specifically serve the needs of those whose job it is to protect children. I am sure that that is the proper starting point. Someone should be responsible for a strategic overview, but the Bill makes no provision for that. Will the Minister explain how that overview can be provided, or undertake to consider the matter and give a satisfactory answer later?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second element of the new clause is about alerting people to the information on the register. As we said in an earlier debate, it must not be treated merely as additional information on the police national computer that does not go anywhere or do anything. The expectation among Members of Parliament on all sides, and among the public, is that the Bill will create a body of information—that is what most people understand by the word "register"—that will help in the job of child protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to create a new bureaucracy or new hardware or software systems if that can be avoided. So long as its handling is overseen and so long as the specific purposes of the Bill can be achieved, the dissemination of information on the police national computer therefore is quite acceptable. I do not suggest that we should create totally new systems or a new bureaucracy, but we need to be certain that there is a strategic overview of the use of the information, how it fits into existing systems of technology and whether it can be accessed automatically. That should be achieved without a great deal of searching and inconvenience, in a way that informs those involved with child protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have clarified the purpose of the new clause. As I said, I do not regard it as perfect; since tabling it, however, I have been able to consult people involved in child protection and in police work. Those consultations have strengthened my belief that there is a gap in the Bill, but that has not led me to think that my quick drafting of the new clause is perfect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other part of the new clause deals with the retention of details and control of data in the database. I should be grateful if the Minister would satisfy us about the impact of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 and reassure us that information can be stored and retrieved and that people can be alerted to it without any difficulties arising from the interface between existing legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite right that we should be concerned that the information provided under the Bill be available and used as efficiently and effectively as possible. I undertook on Tuesday that we would consider advice and the possibility of a code of practice
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
that related directly to the use of the information. I expect that it will also examine procedures in terms of responsibility—that almost covers the first point of the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, we already have an extremely useful database, which is maintained by NCIS. It contains details of known or suspected paedophiles as well as much other information. It is our intention not necessarily to create a new database and a new computerised system but to make good use of what is already an extremely effective tool in supporting the police. Although it may be necessary to have guidance, advice or a code of practice—whichever is most appropriate—we do not want massive extra bureaucracy in relation to the technology. I fully understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but there is little that I can say further to what I said on Tuesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must admit to being somewhat confused by the reference in subsection (2) of the new clause to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. That Act does not apply to the retention of information by the police. It makes provision for certain convictions to become spent after a period of time, which means that in many circumstances ex-offenders need not reveal their criminal record if asked. Provisions in part V of the Police Bill will ensure that that information will be available about those who seek to work with or undertake voluntary work that brings them into direct contact with children. Subsection (2) is therefore unnecessary, although the hon. Gentleman may want to come back on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his helpful response. He said that the point raised by the reference to the 1974 Act in subsection (2) would be dealt with by part V of the Police Bill. I shall look at that, although, of course, the Police Bill is not law at the moment and we should examine the matter when, in the near future, we consider the Bill in Committee. The relationship between the two pieces of legislation is clearly important. The Minister said that the 1974 Act does not apply to information held by the police. However, it is not just a question of information being held—it is its use that is important as a consequence of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That takes us back to a matter that I have already mentioned. We have already accepted that how the information is to be used is a matter for further consideration. I have already said that we intend to review that matter to see what we can come forward with. I suppose that all that links together in the way that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. Of course, the Police Bill is not yet law, but, in this context, it is only right that we should bear in mind legislation that is already on its way to enactment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that entirely. I should be satisfied if the Minister said that the issue of holding of information will be dealt with immediately because the 1974 Act does not apply and that the use and dissemination of such information will be dealt with in the further considerations that have been promised. If that is so, I should be grateful to the Minister for his response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0619">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
I want to raise a couple of other points, which I hope the Minister will take into account in his discussions on the question of who is responsible for such matters. I have been told that the co-ordination of information will be a matter for chief constables or the Commissioner of the Metropolitan police. I accept that that is where the responsibility will lie for police action on information. However, some cases have included not only an international dimension but one that goes across police forces within the United Kingdom and, therefore, it is important to take a strategic look at such matters. I hope that the Minister will take that on board in his considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the database held by NCIS, but the police national computer also holds a considerable amount of information. I understand that there is no direct interface between those databases. Concern has been expressed that information held on the NCIS database would be less accessible to local police forces than that held on the police national computer. I am not expert on those matters, but we must be sure that a strategic overview is taken of them. We must be satisfied that they have been considered properly so that any problem that arises can be dealt with using the systems put in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am assured that the registration information will be held on the police national computer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that intervention, but I was taking up his reference to the NICS computer. The Minister has accepted that coordination on such matters is essential. I am happy to have made those points and to have heard both the Minister's assurance on one or two of them and an indication that there will be deliberations on the others before Report. I am also happy to wait for the outcome of those deliberations. This has been a short, but constructive debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>New Clause 5</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>PROTECTION OF CHILDREN</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>".The Secretary of State may from time to time issue guidance to the police and others on the co-ordination of the use of information notified to the police under this Act with child protection activities, including action undertaken by, or in collaboration with, local area child protection committees and others.".—[	<i>Mr. Michael.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take new clause 6—	<i>Co-ordination of information</i>—
	<br><q><p>".—(1) Any information notified to the police under this Act (including any subsequent changes or amendments to that information) may be supplied to any person or body which holds similar information under any other Act.
	<ol>
	<li>Any person or body which holds similar information under any other Act shall supply that information to the Police National Intelligence Service, and shall advise them of any subsequent changes or amendments to that information.</li>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
	<li>In this section, 'similar information' means any information relating to a person—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>who is subject to a notification requirement under section 1 of this Act; or</li>
	<li>who is believed to be likely to commit a sexual offence, which is held under this or any other Act."</li></ol></ol></p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 5 states:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State may from time to time issue guidance to the police and others on the co-ordination of the use of information notified to the police under this Act … in collaboration with, local area child protection committees and others."</p></q>
It would, therefore, develop a proper system for handling the information required under the Bill. I do not want to labour the point, given the Minister's positive response earlier. New clause 4 would have required a statutory instrument to establish secondary legislation responsibility for handling information. This new clause would clarify the responsibility of the Home Secretary to issue guidance to ensure co-ordination of best practice for child protection. It emphasises the need for collaboration with
	<br><q><p>"local area child protection committees and others"</p></q>
the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, for example, as well as with local police, to ensure that a comprehensive view is taken of how information is to be used. I am sure that the Minister will say that he will consider the matter, along with the other issues of co-ordination of information that have been raised—that will satisfy me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 6 would clarify the position regarding exchange of information—another question on which we have already touched. List 99 is held by the Department for Education and Employment. People who provide information under the Bill when enacted will think that by giving a change of address, for example, to a statutory body, they are ensuring that it is properly logged by the authorities. Many ordinary members of the public, including offenders, think that the authorities are very coherent and well co-ordinated bodies that constantly exchange information. As we know better than that, it is clearly our responsibility to try to ensure the co-ordination of information and to reassure the public. New clause 6 would ensure that once information is notified, other public lists are automatically updated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reference in the new clause 6(2) to the "Police National Intelligence Service" is based on new clause 3—whoever takes overall responsibility would undertake the co-ordination. Questions have been raised about what can and should be passed from one list to another; it is important to make that clear before the Bill is enacted. I hope that the Minister will take that on board during his further deliberations to ensure that there is strengthened co-ordination of action on child protection by drawing together information from other lists. I am sure that that objective is shared by all hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are problems with giving the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth exactly what he wants. I mentioned on Tuesday the enormous amount of co-operation and co-ordination which already takes place. I saw some Opposition Members chuckling when it was suggested that there is not always co-operation and co-ordination at the right level,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0620">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
and I suppose that that is the case, but we should not forget the strides that have been made in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Tuesday, we debated the document, "Working Together", an important joint publication by the Home Office, the then Department of Health and Social Security, the then Department of Education and Science and the Welsh Office, which was issued in 1991. That document achieved a lot, and is currently being updated and revised. We should not forget that there has been an enormous improvement in co-operation and coordination between the police and voluntary agencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sharing of information is not, therefore, a new idea and as I said earlier, it will probably prove appropriate to offer further advice for police forces, once we have considered the response of the police service to the questions we ask them on the best use of information acquired under the provisions of the Bill. I have undertaken to reflect whether we might go further, and have a statutory code of practice. I hope, with that assurance, that the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth will withdraw his new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see the need for the second of the hon. Member's new clauses and I am worried about its potential consequences. He skimmed over it rapidly, but the new clause purports to empower the police to pass on information acquired under the Bill to others who hold similar information under a statutory provision. The consequences of that could be to cast doubt on the ability of the police to pass information derived under the Bill to anyone who is not operating under a statutory provision. That is surely not what hon. Members intend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the new clause goes even wider. It requires anyone holding information under a statutory provision to supply that information to the police if it concerns someone who is subject to a notification requirement, or, importantly, if someone is "believed"—the new clause does not say by whom—to be "likely" to commit a sexual offence. That seems both a remarkably broad and a remarkably vague provision. I do not understand how organisations or individuals will know in any circumstances whether the obligation applies to them. The information to be passed on may itself have nothing to do with sexual offending, or even with offending at all. Subjective belief about another person's likelihood of committing sexual offences, even consensual sexual offences, would be sufficient to require the passing on to the police of everything known about that person. I cannot believe that the hon. Gentleman intends that; nor do I believe that such a provision is needed to enable necessary disclosures. The will and the ability to share information already exists, as has been amply demonstrated. As I have said, I will consider whether anything further in regard to advice or a code of practice is necessary, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will, on reflection, withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the fact that much work has been undertaken by various organisations, including the police and the NSPCC and other statutory agencies, is the reason why we want to ensure that the information required under the Bill is drawn into that development of good practice and co-ordination. I know that the Minister and I agree on that underlying principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
The Minister said that a provision that enables the passage of information would cast doubt on the passage of such information to non-statutory bodies. That is not the intention of the new clause, and in another new clause which the Minister has agreed to consider, we make provision not only for the passage of information to statutory bodies but to voluntary organisations and the public, where appropriate. We are not saying that there should be merely a limitation on the dissemination of information; we are saying that there should be a coordination whereby different lists are held by statutory bodies. There may not be a need to include a provision to enable such a disclosure, for instance from the information held under the Bill to list 99 in the Department for Education and Employment. We want to ensure that not only is that a possibility, but that it happens. The point about the co-ordination of information to statutory bodies is that often people feel that if they have given information to one statutory body, they have given it to all. They say, "I've told the housing department, so the police should be aware of it." Information submitted under the requirements of the Bill will be passed on, so that there is no danger of people thinking that they have notified relevant authorities when they have not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not necessarily disagree with the general principle, but we must scrutinise the new clause. The hon. Gentleman has tried to explain, but the new clause does not clarify whether it is about inclusiveness or exclusiveness. The only reason I complained was because I did not think that it would have a desirable effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's comments. He may be unaware of the limited drafting resources available to the Opposition; we do not have parliamentary counsel to hand. I suspect that in three months' time, the Minister may be more sympathetic than he is now and we may see real tears running down his cheeks, rather than artificial ones. As long as the Minister has understood the concerns behind the new clause and will consider them fully, there is no need for me to delay the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the exchange of information when someone
	<br><q><p>"is believed to be likely to commit a sexual offence".</p></q>
I understand the difficulty of appraising that in legislation, but I hope that the Minister will accept that there are circumstances when that would be right. We must ensure that information is passed to the police when certain triggers are pulled, such as when a civil injunction has been granted against an individual approaching children of a particular family, for example. There may be concrete reasons for triggering a response, but I hope that the Minister will not challenge me to be too inventive and think of half a dozen more reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a dangerous territory. The terms of the new clause are so vague and broad that they could lead to certain expectations which cannot be realised. I appreciate that we are discussing a difficult

and sensitive matter, but we have to be more specific. The hon. Gentleman has tried to be a little more specific, but unless the new clause is sustainable under some legal scrutiny, it would be dangerous to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's comments about the wording of the new clause. The difficulty of drafting on such matters is that we want to hit the elephant—that which is obvious; I am not suggesting ivory hunting. There are problems that we want to tackle, such as situations when children are in danger. To get the provisions in the Bill right and to ensure that they are effective in practice is extremely difficult. That is the challenge of the Bill. The new clause would ensure that information is used and certain situations are targeted. I shall not press the new clause to a Division; I shall be asking leave of the Committee to withdraw it. I am continuing the debate to probe the Minister and to ensure that the issues are considered by him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be murdered by my Whip, for prolonging the debate, but this is an important issue. On Tuesday, we discussed the dangers of vigilantism in providing information in certain circumstances, following conviction for which registration would be applicable. We are now discussing the circumstances of a person not even having met the criterion of being convicted and obliged to register. We are getting into territories where people would make subjective decisions—they think that someone is likely to do something. We must be very careful about that; we all know what we want to achieve, but I do not believe that the proposal is safe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course we are in difficult areas. We want to ensure that those who are not the targets of the Bill are not listed, whereas those who are the targets are listed and put under obligations. Getting that definition right in law is precisely the challenge that the Committee must meet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many of his responses, the Minister has been kind in undertaking to take away and think about our ideas, and I welcome that. I should say to him, however, that those ideas should have been in the Bill in the first place. If they had been, we would not have had to raise them here, but could have discussed the details of targeting. It is our responsibility in Committee to raise concerns and ensure that they are taken into account in any subsequent drafting. The drafting we are discussing now should have taken place before the Bill was introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make that point only because the Minister seemed to suggest that it is mainly the Opposition's job to draft the Bill. I think that we have done a reasonable job in raising the serious concerns that need to be taken into account so that the Bill is effective. I leave our thoughts on the new clauses to what I hope will be a productive period of contemplation and drafting by the Minister, and I look forward to seeing how he has responded when he brings forward amendments and new clauses on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Bill is to protect children from becoming the victim of abusers, but we know that, sadly, children themselves can in certain cases become abusers. Evidence shows that perhaps as many as half of adult abusers were abused in childhood, although mercifully that does apply the other way round—a child who is abused has a much smaller chance of becoming an abuser in later life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the opportunity to discuss child sex offenders who are themselves children. Some of the worst cases of such offences occur when children are taken into care. It is an absolute scandal that children who are taken into public care should be subject to abuse and perhaps in turn become abusers. The case of children in the Welsh homes is being heard at the moment, as are cases of children—including some of my constituents—in homes elsewhere in the north-west. If children are taken into public care they should receive the very best care and not be at risk of falling victim to paedophiles and in turn becoming abusers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strength of the Minister's resolution has been clear in everything that he has said to the Committee. He has been at pains to stress that he does not want the Bill to be weakened. As the record of our sittings on Tuesday shows, the Minister said:
	<br><q><p>"We do not believe that anyone guilty of such an offence should be able to escape the registration requirements. I emphasise that."</p></q>
He was concerned that there should be no weakening of the Bill's safeguards and said:
	<br><q><p>"If there is any doubt that it might, I am bound to urge caution on the Committee."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 4 February 1997; c.24–25.]</p></q>
It is that belief of the Minister's about which I wish to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understood the Bill—the Minister seemed to confirm it in his opening remarks, for which I am grateful—it is possible for 10-year-old children in England, or eight-year-old children in Scotland, to be subject to the requirement to notify for the whole of their lives. It is difficult to believe that such children should be required to register changes of address until the age of 80, or however long they live. We are in danger of weakening the Bill by imposing conditions that make no sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm the sort of actions that could lead to eight-year-old children being required to register for the rest of their lives? A child of eight may be taken into care; perhaps he is put in a care home, which are better managed now than in the past. While there, he might be found guilty of one of the offences listed in schedule 1—for instance, he may be found in possession of an indecent photograph, perhaps given him by an adult abuser at the care home. If that child admitted having such a photograph, would he be required to register his change of address for the rest of his life; and if he did not do so, could he be sent to prison for six months?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
The word "draconian" has been used and the Minister used the word "tough". That provision is beyond being tough. It is nonsensical that a child of that age should be subject to such rigorous requirements, which are designed to apply to adults with dangerous tendencies. We are in danger of weakening the Bill, because it includes requirements that go too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discussing the issue forces us to approach paedophilia realistically and not in black and white terms of simply victims and monsters. A great many adults who abuse children—research shows it to be approximately half—were themselves abused as children, so many of today's monsters were yesterday's victims. And there is no clear dividing line between them. Many children are still being abused when they begin to abuse others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was particularly impressed by the evidence presented by the Children's Charities Consortium, which includes seven of the well-known children's charities—the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Childline, the National Children's Homes Action for Children, Barnardo's, the Save the Children Fund, the National Childrens Bureau, and the National Council of Voluntary Childcare Organisations. Those bodies—we all respect them, I am sure—have expressed their extreme disappointment that the Government included young offenders in the Bill. In their response to the consultation paper, they urge the Government to recognise that juvenile sex offenders should be treated as a quite distinct and separate group from adult sex offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its response to the White Paper, the Association of Chief Officers of Probation said:
	<br><q><p>"We do not believe that inclusion on a register is appropriate to juveniles".</p></q>
Indeed, ACOP, the Children's Charities Consortium and the National Association for the Development of Work with Sex Offenders all felt so strongly on the question of juvenile offenders that they asked that it should be the subject of a separate consultation paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Young child sex offenders highlight the importance of treatment and rehabilitation. The children themselves are in desperate need and often do not know where to turn for help. As far as is known, the vast majority of children who have been abused do not go on to abuse others. So it is not an inevitable cycle; it can be broken and we have a duty to ensure that such children are treated so that it is broken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have studied the research papers on the subject, particularly those from the Faithfull Foundation; I recommend the work done by all those concerned with Lucy Faithfull's organisation. I have had particular dealings with Ray Wyre and with Hilary Eldridge, the clinical consultant at the foundation, and also with Don Finlater of the probation service who runs the Wolvercote residential treatment centre so well. The research papers are not based on many offenders who have been through treatment because the course is relatively new. The research findings of October 1996, concerning phase 3 of the programme known as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
STEP—the treatment of sex offenders to reduce reoffending—states:
	<br><q><p>"None of the 24 offenders who were assessed as having been significantly treated had been reconvicted within two years. This includes nine who were assessed as being highly deviant before treatment."</p></q>
So that work is spoken of highly. I was disappointed that so few hon. Members who spoke on Second Reading, from both sides of the House, were aware of the value of that treatment. The right hon. and learned Member for Putney (Mr. Mellor), who has had long ministerial experience, including in the Home Office, said that he did not think it was possible for treatment to be successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recommend strongly the work done at the residential treatment centre at Wolvercote and urge the Government to help provide a future home for it because the current premises, which are owned by the Department of Health, are to be sold within a year or so as a housing development; presumably, the developers will not want a paedophile treatment centre in the middle of their new development, so the centre has no security in terms of premises. I had a meeting with one of the Minister's colleagues, but was given no assurance that other premises could be provided. It will be extremely difficult for the Faithfull Foundation to organise its affairs, raise funding and provide sufficient professional help to ensure the success of such programmes if there is no offer of premises. Because of the difficulty of obtaining suitable premises, the Government must exercise their responsibility in that area and not just leave it to others. The predecessors of the work at Wolvercote, which was conducted by Ray Wyre through the Gracewell clinic, suffered two arson attacks by people who did not want paedophile treatment centres near their homes. If the Government face up to their duties and admit that we must have such treatment centres, they should help provide premises. It is good that the present premises are being provided through the Department of Health, but they have a limited future. I hope that the Minister can give some comfort to the Committee on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only should the existing treatment centre—the only one of its kind in the country—continue, but we should have other treatment centres throughout the country, particularly for the treatment of juveniles, because that is where the Government's responsibility is greatest. The Children's Charities Consortium has stressed to me the importance of those young offenders receiving treatment and help through the child protection service rather than being stigmatised at an early age. It is unfair and totally wrong that children taken into care should be victims of abuse and become potential or actual offenders themselves, thereby being stigmatised for the rest of their lives. We should provide them with treatment so that they can enter the community as responsible and constructive contributors to society, rather than being treated as people who should be viewed with suspicion for the rest of their lives. Some of the members of the consortium, for example the NSPCC and Barnado's have, direct experience of working with young sex offenders through treatment programmes. There is much evidence showing that such young sex offenders are amenable to treatment and that appropriate intervention is likely to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0623">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
be much more immediately effective than it is with adult offenders. As has already been said, area child protection committees are the proper agencies to bring attention to the needs of offenders under the age of 16, and they already contact the police when appropriate. Extra stigmatisation in such cases is not only unnecessary but extremely unhelpful to children's treatment programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Children's Charities Consortium is also concerned about the consequences of parental responsibility for regisration, when young sex offenders may well themselves be experiencing abuse within their families. There are significant differences in the legal framework within which juvenile offenders are managed and inconsistencies in how reported offences committed by juveniles are processed because of the difficulty of proof.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In cases in which children admit that they are offending and, with family support, engage in therapeutic work, the may well be subject to a police caution or prosecution. They will then fall within the terms of the Bill and may be required to register their address for the rest of their lives. Juvenile offenders who deny their behaviour, whose denial is supported by their family, and whose victims may have been so traumatised as to be unable to give a coherent account of the offence, escape prosecution and the terms of the Bill. Such inconsistencies are much greater among children than among adults.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore urge the Committee to consider removing children under the age of 16 from the notification requirements. Not to do so would be to admit failure—to admit that instead of giving such children the treatment that they should have, we are going down the cheap and easy road of stigmatising them for the rest of their lives. We should face our responsibility to ensure that such children receive treatment and are not so stigmatised at the age of eight years as to have to report their changes of address for the rest of their lives. Although I shall not press the new clause to a Division, I hope that the Minister will be able to give me some encouragement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand the hon. Gentleman's intention: that juveniles should not be burdened for the rest of their lives with a registration requirement. I suggest that he is somewhat missing the point. As I said earlier, the notification requirement is intended primarily to secure the protection of children and the public. It is not a penalty. We must remember that some horrific crimes are committed by young people. Only the other day, I read of a violent rape committed by a 14-year-old. I mentioned on Tuesday that someone who is quite elderly should not be ruled out. The same applies here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many checks and balances to assist in dealing with children. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the presumption that children under 14 do not know that what they have done is wrong. The hon. Gentleman referred to an eight-year-old and an indecent photo. It would be unlikely that such a child would have sufficient understanding to be found guilty; prosecution would be most unlikely in such a case. It is certainly unlikely that a court would handle such a case so as to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
leave such a young child liable for a lifetime registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland, it is almost inconceivable that a child would be convicted of such a crime by a court. His case would be held by a children's hearing, which cannot result in a conviction, and so he would not fall within the terms of the Bill—I am sure that the hon. Member for Dumbarton is aware of that. Even if such a case were taken by a court in Scotland, it would always be as a summary case, and the registration requirement would therefore last for only five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to say to the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East that it would be wrong for us to exclude a large number of young people for the sake of protecting the very few who are in the circumstances that he described. Anyone who can exhibit such behavioural tendencies at such as early age represents a serious risk to the public. The registration period follows the sentence of the court and the judge, who hears all the evidence in the case and passes the appropriate sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not deny that there is much potential for the reform of young people. The hon. Gentleman knows that finite registration periods have been halved for under 18-year-olds. Let us consider the juvenile who receives a sentence that has the effect of being for more than two-and-a-half years and comes within the registration for life provision under the Bill. The crime that that juvenile committed must have been very serious. I ask the hon. Gentleman withdraw the amendment, but I am not dismissing his argument. I want to ensure that that children are treated in the appropriate way, but society must be protected—whatever the age of the person who is convicted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with a great deal of what the Minister said. We can think of horrific examples of offences that would lead a thinking person to say that an automatic cut-off at a particular age is inappropriate and fails to recognise reality. However, the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East made some valid points about the way in which we deal with children and the fact that there will be many cases when registration is inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not as satisfied as the Minister seems to be that it would be completely impossible for an inappropriate case to be caught under the Bill. To exclude entirely those under 16 years of age from its provisions is far too simple and perhaps the matter should be approached differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We considered some cases on Tuesday and talked about the possibilities of having a mechanism to deal with exceptions. The lack of such a mechanism is giving rise to concern. I understand the Minister's response on Tuesday to that argument, but he might like to consider it again in relation to this new clause. The Bill will require registration, however unreasonable and irrelevant it might be in certain cases. Rather than there being a blanket exclusion from the provisions for those under 16, surely some mechanism should be in place to allow exclusion to be recognised in limited cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot agree with the hon. Member. It is important that the matter is made clear and absolute in the Bill. The checks and balances that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
are built into the system when dealing with young offenders are extremely onerous, not only in terms of protecting the rights of young people, but in the court system. For children to reach the point when they are liable for lifetime registration, a not unique but extremely serious offence has to have been committed. In those extreme circumstances, registration is appropriate. The hon. Gentleman said that exclusions are made when the circumstances are not appropriate, but the system itself determines the appropriateness of the case. It is not necessary to have details in the Bill concerning the likely areas in which exclusion might be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In general, I accept what the Minister says. He has greater belief than I have, however, in the perfection of both the law and the system. I have enough experience of youth justice to know that it can act extremely bluntly and ineffectively; mistakes and errors of judgment can be made. The Minister is being too complacent about the effectiveness of the checks and balances to meet all possible circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will he consider whether there may be a need for a mechanism which, when appropriate, could ensure that inappropriate, lifetime registration does not happen because it is an automatic provision under the Bill? Otherwise, mistakes could be made in the not too distant future. I recall when the Criminal Justice Act 1991 was going through and a Home Office Minister failed to envisage what could happen with a crisp packet in a car park in Gwent. The Minister may regret being unwilling to consider the need for a degree of flexibility, however carefully limited and subscribed. If the Minister is wise, he will take that into account when reconsidering our debates in Committee, but I would not support the new clause being included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I would go quite as far as the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth in saying that the Minister was complacent. But there is a danger in not facing reality. There are extremely serious issues involving 10-year-olds. Only a year or so ago, there was the terrible murder of Jamie Bulger in Liverpool. Two 10-year-olds were found guilty of the murder of that very young child. I believe that there was evidence of sexual interference before the murder took place. That is an example of two 10-yearolds being guilty of the most heinous of offences. We must face such matters. The danger of allowing the Bill to go through as it stands is that we are being complacent in a sense by saying that such terrible offences can be committed by children, so they should be on a register for the rest of their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be ensuring that society is conducted in such a way that 10-year-old children never commit such heinous offences, but that if something so dreadful happens, they are given every sort of treatment to become responsible adults. The Home Secretary is now involved in a case concerning the age at which those two boys will be released. We must face the fact that such young offenders have to come back into society
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
and that their need for treatment must be addressed so successfully that we can be confident that they can do so. There is a danger that if we allow the Bill to be enacted as it stands, people who have gone wrong at the age of 10 are written off and that is it for life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth made the point that there must be a mechanism to allow names to be removed from the register so that by the age of 70 or 80 people are not still going to a police station every time they change their address or risk being sent to prison for six months if they do not do so. If we treat people in that way, we shall destroy the treatment that we are trying to give them because we almost stigmatise them to the point that they believe that they are sex offenders. I do not know whether the Minister saw the BBC television programme about Megan's law when some of the paedophile offenders said that if that is what they were, that is what they would continue to be and that they would be better at that than anything else. They feel that all they can do with the rest of their lives is to continue offending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a tragedy for us to enact a Bill allowing eight-year-olds in Scotland and 10-year-olds in England to be stigmatised for the rest of their lives. If we were to provide a mechanism either to exclude them completely from the Bill or, as the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth said, to remove their names from the register, we shall be facing our responsibilities. Even though I do not want to press the matter now, perhaps we can return to it on Report or in another place, because we must not stigmatise children in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no intention to stigmatise—the word that the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East has continually used. Notification can be done by post by parents if the court so decides. There will be no imprisonment—as I am sure the hon. Gentleman is aware—for failure to notify when the person is under 18. I cannot quite understand the hon. Gentleman's argument about stigmatising or continuing punishment. Is not it right that in the appalling cases of young people perpetrating the most terrible crimes, on-going registration should be required to protect the public?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Minister says, but he said nothing about treatment. He has not commented on the concern that only one residential treatment centre exists at the moment. He said nothing more about all the research findings that exist. In the meeting that I had with the Minister of State at the Home Office, the hon. Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe), she said that she thought all the evidence was anecdotal. The Government must do better than that. They must give a commitment that they intend to provide the best treatment to such offenders, especially in cases involving children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister said that it would be up to parents to give notification, they might be abusers, so we cannot simply regard them as having the proper responsibility that they should have. The responsibility to report changes of address will rest with such children, and it will continue to do so when they are adults until they die. That will stigmatise them as victims of abuse who have become abusers who are not capable of being treated so that they become safe and responsible

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause relates to sexual offences against people with severe learning disabilities. It is drafted widely to give the Secretary of State powers to deal with such cases. The Bill reflects the strength of emotion with which society regards the sexual abuse of children, but we should include those with learning difficulties—both are vulnerable to the sad intentions of people with twisted minds. In such cases, similar feelings are aroused to those involving paedophiles, with whom the Bill deals directly. Indeed, such offenders show similar tendencies and patterns of offending to paedophiles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those with severe learning difficulties are especially vulnerable, so we owe them an extra duty of care and protection. I therefore urge the Committee to do all it can to protect those with learning difficulties from the danger of sex offenders who target them. I should like that to be acknowledge above and beyond the inclusion of the victims already listed in schedule. I look forward to what the Minister has to say about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether the Minister is aware of the work done by the charity, Voice, which was founded in 1993 by the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mrs. Currie) following a constituency case with which she was concerned. Voice supports people with learning disabilities who have been sexually abused. Its particular strength is in the support and advice it gives to victims, their families, their carers, the police and other services. Voice has held a number of meetings in the House, and I commend the work that it does. In particular, it is pressing for improvements to court procedures so that mentally disabled witnesses can be treated in the same way as child abuse victims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will consider the views of another group—the National Association for the Protection from Sexual Abuse of Adults and Children with Learning Disabilities—as well as those of Voice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the past two weeks, an extremely difficult constituency case has come to my attention, involving a very good family with seven brothers and sisters. Sadly, one of the sisters is mentally retarded—she has the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
mental age of a 12-year-old. She had been brought up in a loving and trustful way within that family. She had a good life, within obvious limitations, until the point came when she became vulnerable to the attention of others and the family could no longer protect her. Sadly, through the work of a psychiatric nurse, she was introduced to someone who was himself extremely disturbed and she has now come under the influence of that person. As far as I can see, his activities are little better than those of a pimp. The young women has been seen working in the red light area of Bolton, and her family are at their wits' end as to what to do about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause should cover those adults who, because of their learning difficulties, are as vulnerable as children. Sadly, such people seem to be attractive to certain paedophiles, who believe that they can get their way with them—these offences are all about manipulation and power. We should treat people with those tendencies in the same way as we do people who find children attractive. I hope that the Minister will give consideration to that, and allow the Bill to be extended so that the Secretary of State has the greater powers suggested in the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The definition provided by the hon. Gentleman reflects the offences under sections 7, 9 and 29 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956, which relate to defectives. Section 45 of that Act defines defective as a person suffering from a state of arrested or incomplete development of mind, which includes severe impairment of intelligence and social functioning within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1959.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause refers to severe learning difficulty, and I recognise that the definition of severe learning disability is based on—although it is potentially wider than—the definition used by the Government when successfully amending the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Bill on 20 January. That amendment provides for special provisions on the admissibility of evidence in court proceedings in Scotland where a person was defined as "vulnerable". That definition included children under 16 and adults who
	<br><q><p>"appear to the court to suffer from significant impairment of intelligence and social functioning".</p></q>
Such a provision would be completely unworkable in respect of those with past convictions whom we want the Bill to cover. The courts will not necessarily have established whether the victim or the other party had a severe learning difficulty, and we would not therefore be able to identify and notify those offenders. That would create a complete anomaly between those convicted in the past and those who might be convicted after the commencement of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are of course concerned to ensure that the criminal justice system takes proper account of the needs of people with learning disabilities. That is why we commissioned research into the treatment of witnesses with learning disabilities, the summary findings of which have recently been published in the Home Office research findings. The research identified many important issues, and the Government announced on 23 January that they would undertake a wide-ranging review of the treatment of vulnerable witnesses, including those with learning disabilities.

I was interested to her of the organisation Voice and its work and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for alerting the Committee to it. I believe, however, that it would be better to consider the special needs of people with learning disabilities in the light of the Government's review; it is not what the Bill is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>NOTIFICATION ORDERS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>".—(1) A relevant authority may, on the application of a chief officer of police, serve a person with a notification order, provided that the authority is satisfied that there is a serious risk that that person will commit a sexual offence to which Part I of this Act applies.
	<ol>
	<li>A notification order shall be deemed to have been served if it is delivered to that person, or to his home address, by a constable.</li>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is clearly concern in the Committee and outside that part I applies only to convicted offenders. We all know that conviction is often the culmination of continual and persistent activity verging on the criminal, probably arousing suspicion about the suspect's ultimate intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suspicion of criminal intent will not necessarily -be confined to the victimised children or their parents. Statutory or voluntary bodies concerned with child protection may be aware of the suspect's activities. Social workers, educationalists, the National Society for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Childline and others in the Children's Charities Consortium as well as the police may all be aware of the threat implicit in a person's deviant behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All too often, nothing can be done about such activity. It may or may not develop into an offence which, if committed, may or may not result in a conviction for all the reasons with which we are familiar—lack of evidence, the reluctance of victims to testify, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my hon. Friend the Minister has gone as far as he can with clause 1(1)(c), under which a person cautioned in respect of an offence who admits it at the time can be forced to give notification. But supposing someone does not admit the offence, and then either is not taken to court or is taken to court but is not convicted because of the weakness of the evidence against him or her. That can happen on more than one occasion and mount up to a sizeable body of possibly weak but relevant evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause proposes that statutory or voluntary bodies acting in concert with the police may require a person to give notification under the Bill. We have said time and again that registration is not a punishment. Its practical effect is to ensure that the police are well informed and will keep an eye on the registrants. The potential offender whose behaviour has been such as to draw the attention of relevant bodies to the extent that they require him or her to give notification should also be closely observed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notification requirement may itself deter an individual from offending; it will certainly give an additional measure of protection to children and young people. That is the essential justification for the new clause, which is based on my study of individual cases such as that of Sophie Hook, and of the spate of information about children abused in children's homes in north Wales, Cheshire, the north-west of England and elsewhere. The new clause is preventive in character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that my hon. Friend the Minister's brief is headlined, "Resist", and contains reams of arguments against the new clause. I am aware of some of those arguments—in particular, the general reluctance to proceed on the basis of suspicion, however well justified it may be. There is also the danger of false, mistaken and even malicious attempts to get a person registered, and the dire consequences of such an error.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We live, however, in the real world, in which various authorities have a lot of information about people—the Department of Health's index and the Department for Education and Employment's list 99 have already been mentioned. In the case of the Department of Health's list, only one employing authority has to lay evidence against a person for that person to be listed. As far as I am aware, the police do not have to be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police have computer data on all those convicted of schedule 1 offences under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, and a great deal more information besides, as my hon. Friend suggested in his response to new clause 3. I am told—I have not studied it closely—that there is a provision in the Police Bill whereby a person seeking a child-related job can seek a clearance certificate from the police. I believe that my hon. Friend has already referred to that this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0627">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
The new clause is intended to add to that body of knowledge. Of course, we do not want to infringe the liberty of the individual, or to create a Stasi-style record, as was kept in East Germany before unification. At the end of the day, we must weigh what might be against what might be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Children's Charities Consortium says:
	<br><q><p>"The majority of children are not abused by convicted offenders and in cases where prosecution follows disclosure of abuse, the conviction rate still remains disturbingly low. The risk to children posed by child sexual offenders cannot be underestimated and the abuser may sexually assault hundreds of children over a period of years."</p></q>
Bearing that in mind, there is much to gain from the provisions in the new clause, which can be activated in well-defined circumstances by statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand my right hon. Friend' s aims in introducing the new clause. I am sure that the anxiety and concern expressed in his constituency, arising particularly from the very sad incident of Sophie Hook, must weigh on his mind. It is right that that should be so. Of course children and the public should be protected, but there must be checks and balances, even in regard to that sort of offence. I return to what I said earlier: we must rely on a conviction obtained in the criminal courts. The new clause requires the registering of offenders, backed by a criminal sanction for failure to do so. Although I understand my right hon. Friend's strong feelings on the subject, it simply would not be possible to place anyone under such an obligation, on the basis of unproven suspicion. I assure my right hon. Friend that there are other mechanisms for recording suspicions about paedophiles: I have mentioned NCIS, for example, in that regard. That falls short of a requirement to register, but such a requirement, for the reasons I have mentioned, is not sustainable. I regret that I cannot recommend the Committee to accept the new clause, but I appreciate my right hon. Friend's comments and I am sure that we are all as concerned as he to offer as much protection to children and others as we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister might have chided his right hon. Friend for suggesting that he would be so inflexible as simply to follow the instruction to resist all amendments. The right hon. Member for Conwy (Sir W. Roberts) earned himself the nickname of the bardic steamroller for the way in which, throughout a long and distinguished career and in Committee after Committee, he resisted any amendment, however wise and flexible. On behalf of the Minister, I should say how unreasonable was the right hon. Gentleman's comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be serious, the right hon. Gentleman has raised an important concern about how we extend our protection of children. The new clause, however, is less flexible than other amendments. It is sensible that an assessment of risk should be introduced, as we said in our previous sitting, and the right hon. Gentleman is reinforcing the concerns that the Minister undertook to consider. However, the proposals are too inflexible and go beyond the type of offence dealt with in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for his comments. He will know that I was probing the ground in tabling the new clause; I agree that not even I thought that I had penetrated successfully the barrier of requiring a conviction before someone is put on the register.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second Time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Tuesday, we discussed proof of identity and the Minister reassured us about certain points. It is important to ensure that we can depend on the information that is provided. When registering, what information would a person have to provide? I refer to a domestic profile, as it has been described, and suggestions have been made concerning the provision of information about other people who live at the person's residence, especially if there are young children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear whether it would be possible to require such information under a code-of-practice mechanism or whether a separate amendment would be required to bring that into being. I should be grateful if the Minister could expand on the type of information that could be required to provide such information at the time of registration or at the time of notifying a change of address, so that the authorities are alerted. When there are vulnerable people in a household, such information could be picked up by the police or those involved in the local arrangements for protection of the children. There could be times when such information might not be known, as a result of which the matter might require further consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot be of great help to the hon. Gentleman. The new clause poses a danger of over specification.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>87</span>
matter becomes more difficult when deciding what has to be given to provide evidence of identity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor can I reassure the hon. Gentleman about how we would deal with the other details that he considers might be appropriate. Without amendment, there is not a specific provision in the Bill that would allow for such details to go into guidance. I spoke at some length on Tuesday about identity and how much information should be provided. We shall consider guidance or a code of practice if we can arrange it, but I cannot accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the Minister's assurances on Tuesday, I can be brief. I hope that my second point, which I accept went a little wide of the new clause, is one that we might consider between now and on Report. I shall write to the Minister about it to aid our deliberations. We suggested such a mechanism on Tuesday, because we did not want to be too specific. However, if the Bill does not provide for flexibility, perhaps certain details should be contained in it. I shall leave the matter for now, but I should be grateful if the Minister could reflect on that point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again I can be brief, because our proposal is simple and straightforward. The Minister's response to a variety of points that we have raised so far highlights the complexity and difficulty of dealing adequately with all the issues covered by the Bill. We need to be precise and to target our actions while allowing for flexibility. That is a difficult balance to achieve. It is always difficult to anticipate everything when framing legislation and the more mechanisms that are built in to allow future flexibility the better, as long as that is done in the right way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conduct of a review and subsequent reports on the operation of the Bill when it is enacted would be taken as the Government's assurance that the legislation will be used in the way in which Parliament intended
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
and would also ensure that civil liberties and individuals are protected. We believe that reports should be made regularly and that objectivity would be guaranteed by such reports being
	<br><q><p>"prepared by such person as the Lord Chancellor may appoint".</p></q>
Whether it is a big operation or a lighthanded review depends on whether people think that the legislation is working satisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause has an element of flexibility and is not just a bureaucratic requirement. The report would refer to the activities that will follow from the Bill's enactment because the information will be
	<br><q><p>"notified for the protection of children",</p></q>
rather than just be held in a dead form on a register or computer. It would act as a reassurance of Parliament's intentions and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that hon. Gentleman will not think that I am becoming more difficult as the morning wears on, but I am unable to give him much comfort. There are already perfectly good channels for holding the Government accountable for the effects of their legislation, and I have no doubt that the hon. Gentleman will ask lots of questions, as necessary, on the points that he has identified, as time goes by. The new clause would create a novel—though not unique—procedure, with no means of deciding in the future that the legislation is working well and that no further reports are necessary. If we were to accept the new clause, we would be faced with reports stretching endlessly into the future. I am not saying that it is not desirable to keep an eye on legislation and how it is proceeding, but there are other ways of doing that. I do not believe that the clause is necessary and ask the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why we suggested having more than one report was that the end of the first 12 months might be too soon for a full assessment of the operation of the legislation. I ask the Minister to reflect and to consider whether there should be a requirement to review the legislation on a one-off basis after a reasonable period. He may be asking for something similar from the Opposition Benches in a year or so. As I said, I am disappointed by his response, but I shall not labour the point.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we are all agreed that difficulties can sometimes arise in taking forward prosecutions for possessions of child pornography, although it might be possible in the same circumstances to secure a conviction for importation of the prohibited material. Child pornography is frequently imported for personal use, and closing that loophole will strike against active paedophiles who might otherwise escape prosecution and hence registration. It is a very desirable proposal. I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely sure what effect the amendments will have—the Minister was speaking to quite a string of amendments. For instance, in amendment No. 44, the relevance of fraudulent evasion of duty to the requirement to register for the offences listed in the schedule is not completely clear. I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can. Although Customs and Excise is empowered to pursue offences of simple possession of indecent material under section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988—with the approval of the Crown Prosecution Service—it does not always have the evidence to pursue a possession offence due to various legal difficulties, and will often have to proceed on the importation offence alone. The omission of Customs and Excise importation offences from the list of offences in schedule 1 to the Bill would mean that, in those circumstances, an offender convicted of important child pornography would not appear on the sex offenders register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recent highly publicised Customs and Excise prosecution of the United Kingdom diplomat Robert Coughlan, who was gaoled for three years, is just such a case. It is important that the list of offences should include the offence of importing indecent or obsence material featuring children under section 170 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979. If that offence is not included, we shall find the authorities being criticised for having failed to register, and thus identify, an active child abuser.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I understand. During the previous Session, when the Sexual Offences (Conspiracy and Incitement) Act 1996 was in Committee, I argued that the seizure of material, including child pornography and other evidence of the activities of the offender, should be allowed by the British courts. I seem to remember that the Minister resisted that proposal. Will that apply only if the person concerned is an abuser, or will it apply in a simple case of possession of pornography? Can the possession of imported pornographic material, however objectionable it may be and even if it has nothing to do with that person's activities, trigger off the registration requirement for that offender? Will that be the effect of the amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I understand that that is the case; the amendment therefore introduces a wider context to cover those sorts of people. As the hon. Gentleman knows, mere possession is already listed. Importation is an important element in cases where there is insufficient evidence for a charge of possession,

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We seek to ensure that those who are intended to be targeted—that is, those who are a danger to children—are caught, but that those who are no danger to children are not included needlessly within the ambit of Bill. It might be helpful to say that we are seeking a degree of consistency by tabling amendment No. 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has already accepted that there is a need for flexibility by introducing the Bill in its present form. Some of the offences that people might think should be dealt with by registration should be excluded to avoid unfairness in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, there is an exclusion for offences committed by people under the age of 20 on girls as young as 13. So a young man aged a month or two short of his 20th birthday who commits an offence against a girl who is a little over 13 would not have to register under the provisions of the Bill if those acts were consensual. Clearly, if they were not consensual,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0630">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>91</span>
provisions on assault could be used and, therefore, they would come within the ambit of the Bill. If no compulsion were involved, that young man near that age of 20 who committed an act with a girl a little over 13 would not have to register under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 14 would simply apply that principle to acts of gross indecency committed on those who are aged 16 or 17. Indeed, Lord Woolf, whose judgments might be regarded as being vested with even greater authority in view of the office he holds, has judged that acts of gross indecency can take place only if there is consent. Therefore, we are talking of consensual acts only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendment No. 14, we suggest that the provision should not apply where the other party was 16 or over at the time of the offence unless a court sentenced the offender to a term of imprisonment. In such cases, someone just over the age of 20—perhaps a month or two older than in my first example—might be involved in an act with a young man who is a few months short of his 18th birthday. For example, where people live together—perhaps in student accommodation—it would be easy for something to happen that everyone would recognise as not appropriate for lifetime registration under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, under amendment No. 14, if courts regard those offences—clearly, they remain offences under current law—as requiring terms of imprisonment, however short, they would come within the provisions on registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with an extremely small number of offences, as the Minister will realise if he examines the Home Office statistics. In 1995—the last full year for which figures are available—there were 11 convictions and four custodial sentences. So the target area of the amendment is small, but would ensure that unfairness is not introduced into the Bill. As I said earlier, the Government have accepted that some offences should be excluded—indeed, I would regard those offences as more serious and extreme; someone aged almost 20, for example, involved in an act with a girl perhaps a few weeks over 13, which would not require registration under the Bill. Perhaps the Minister would respond on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 56 excludes certain offences. There are two very different types of indecent assault: one involves consenting sexual acts other than intercourse with a person aged under 16—boys and girls are deemed not capable of consenting to any sexual act by virtue of subsections 14(2) and 15(2) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. The other type—which I am sure the Minister would agree is quite different—is that of acts that are both indecent and an assault, in other words, where consent is withheld. That could be unwanted groping of genitals, an attempted rape or even rape by digital penetration or using an instrument such as a bottle. The former type of offence is much less serious and I ask the Minister to consider whether it should be subject to the same exception as other consenting offences that the Government, in drafting
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
the legislation, have already excluded. A range of offences therefore exists, some of which the Committee would recognise as requiring registration, and others that are not intended for inclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would have no effect on non-consenting offences because it applies only to offences that would not have been an offence under the relevant paragraphs of the Sexual Offences Act 1956, nor would it have any effect on those who commit offences against children under 14 since such offences, which always require registration, can be prosecuted under subsection 1(1) of the Indecency With Children Act 1960. So the amendment does not reduce the power of the courts to deal with such offences and where the offence is unusually serious—which I am told is exceptional—the court would give an appropriate sentence and registration would apply because the exemption does not apply where a custodial sentence has been passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have put the issues as clearly as I can. The amendments deal with a narrow target area but would ensure that the provisions of the Bill are fairer and prevent the inclusion of those whom the Government and the House do not intend to target.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to several amendments that focus on the Scottish context. Amendment No. 58 is identical to amendment No. 14, which applies to England and Wales. I should like the same provisions to apply to Scotland; where the other party is 16 or over, the legislation should not apply unless a term of imprisonment has been imposed by the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 59 deals with an issue that has generated much correspondence in Scotland, especially from the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Equality Network and organisations such as PHACE—the Project for HIV and AIDS Care and Education. The amendment deals with a number of anomalies that apply in Scotland but not in England and Wales. Although Scots law is very different from English law in many areas, the sex offenders registration scheme will apply across the United Kingdom so that a national register can be set up. If registered offenders can move freely between different parts of the United Kingdom, it is important that the kind of offence requiring registration in the three different legal jurisdictions of the United Kingdom should be comparable. We tabled the amendment with that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Equality Network suggested, such important inconsistencies and anomalies remain perhaps because of the rapidity with which the Bill was drafted. The Minister knows that I have contacted the Scottish Office about the issue, but as yet there has been no enlightenment and I hope that he can tell me that some progress has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of most concern is the fact that, under the Bill, all men aged over 20 convicted in Scotland—but not in England—for homosexual activity that is not in private will be compelled to register. The example that was given to me concerns a gay couple who are fined £50 for engaging in sexual activity in a parked car—they would have to register in Scotland but not in England. The equality network suggests, and I agree, that that is in no way comparable with child molestation or rape and that the men are not a danger to a public. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0631">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>93</span>
example falls outwith the Bill's intention, which is to cover those who pose a danger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes that consensual homosexual acts between people aged 18 or over be excepted from the list of offences requiring registration. If the offences are exempted in England, they should, in the name of consistency and equality, also be exempted in Scotland. With that in mind, I ask the Minister for his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support the position taken by the hon. Members for Dumbarton and for Cardiff, South and Penarth. Amendment No. 71, which I tabled, is the same as amendment No. 59 and I have added my name to amendment No. 14, so I do not wish to detain the Committee other than to say that we should do all that can to ensure that there is consistency between the different parts of the United Kingdom. If we cannot easily achieve that consistency here, how can we hope for a Europe-wide register—or one that extends even wider—between police forces in different countries? We must achieve consistency here, and I do not understand why we have such anomalies and inconsistencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also support the argument that there should be consistency between homosexual and heterosexual acts, so that the same age limits apply. We should not clutter up the register with the names of those who have committed victimless, adult and consensual acts. The position is supported by the Children's Charities Consortium, which wrote to me stating:
	<br><q><p>"If the register is to work effectively and efficiently, and equally important, if it is to command public support, it must be wholly focused on offences which involve the sexual abuse and exploitation of children, and serious assaults on adults."</p></q>
I agree with that. To exclude from the register those who are not guilty of paedophile or violent sexual offences makes good sense and is in the interests of justice. If heterosexuals who have engaged in comparable sexual acts would not be committing a criminal offence, let alone be required to register, it seems nonsensical for the Bill to cover such offences. As Liberty pointed out, the Bill accepts that sex between men committed outside the United Kingdom should not be a criminal offence when one of the parties is aged 16 or over, so I urge the Minister to remove such inconsistencies and anomalies. I shall not say anything further about the Scottish position because it has been covered well by the hon. Member for Dumbarton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with a mixture of English and Scottish measures, and I shall deal first with those to which the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth spoke. Amendment No. 14 would exclude from registration offenders convicted of indecency between men, when a custodial sentence was not imposed. The implication is that the sentencing judge or magistrate must have regarded the offence as not particularly serious. However, any sentence imposed is a reflection of wrongdoing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A boy under 18 years of age is still a child in the eyes of the law, and a man who commits an act of indecency with a child is committing a serious crime. The proposed exclusion could also undermine the difference in the age of consent between heterosexuals and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>94</span>
homosexuals—a matter to which the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East referred and on which Parliament has already ruled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have argued that, when the perpetrator is much older, it is more likely that manipulative and coercive pressure may have been exerted. We have already gone as far as we can be making an exclusion when the two parties involved are of similar age. As a result of that, I cannot accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 56 would exclude from the registration requirement offences of indecent assault on a girl or boy under the age of 16, when the so-called assault was, in fact, consensual. The reason why such behaviour counts as an assault is that, under the relevant legislation, a child of under 16 is not considered to be able to give consent to activities which, if nonconsensual, would count as assault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would provide further safeguards in that the exclusion applies only when the offender is under the age of 20 and was not sentenced to imprisonment. It raises an anomaly. A teenager who has committed unlawful intercourse with a girl under the age of 16 would avoid the requirement, whereas the same teenager, if charged with assault as a result of consensual indecent behaviour, but not intercourse, would be required to register. It seems extremely unlikely, however, that someone in that situation would be prosecuted. If the behaviour was genuinely consensual, the offence would probably not come to light. Even if it did, it is unlikely that the Crown Prosecution Service would consider it in the public interest to prosecute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, there may be some cases when the victim was particularly vulnerable, either being immature or having been a victim of abuse. In such cases, the apparent consent of the child would need to be weighted against the need to protect him or her and a prosecution may be more likely. But the fact that an offender was aware of, or took advantage of, the vulnerability of a child may be an indication that he should be required to register. I accept that there is an anomaly and if the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth is happy for me to do so, I shall at least consider the matter further and possibly come forward with proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the Scottish amendments, I was mugging up on Scottish law over night, but that does not make me more able to accept amendment No. 58. It is inappropriate because of the nature of the common law offence in Scotland of lewd, indecent and libidinous behaviour. It is an offence that is committed when the victim is below the age of puberty. If the child were above the age of puberty, different offences would apply depending on the facts. It is most likely that the offender would be charged with indecent assault or shameless indecency. Accordingly, it does not make sense to seek to qualify that common law offence on the basis of cases when the victim was 16 years of age or over as, in such a case, there would not have been an offence of lewd, indecent and libidinous behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 55, 59, 70 and 71 would remove from the registration requirement adults convicted of homosexual offences in Scotland when the other party was willing and over the age of 18—or 16, as the case
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0632">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>95</span>
may be. Those are acts amounting to sodomy, gross indecency or shameless indecency with other men carried out in public—which includes public lavatories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That proposal was put to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland as part of a complex package of suggested amendments to the Bill. My right hon. Friend is carefully considering the proposals. I am not yet in a position to give the hon. Member for Dumbarton a definitive response, but I will be considering the matter with my right hon. Friend and other colleagues, and we will report back to the House. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment on the basis that we undertake further to consider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his constructive response. Under the Bill as drafted, all men over 20 convicted in Scotland—but not in England—of homosexual activity that is not in private will be compelled to register. Let us contrast that with the fact that a man who is sent to prison for two years for an indecent assault on a woman will not have to register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for his comments, and look forward to his further response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be clear: was the Minister agreeing to consider the substance of amendment No. 14?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, amendment No. 56, not amendment No. 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall therefore briefly address amendment No. 14, and invite the Minister to reconsider his position on it. As I understood him, he said that amendment No. 14 would exclude from registration an individual who had been involved in certain illegal acts that remain wrongdoing, even if they were consensual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is perhaps correct, but the Minister did not explain why other illegal acts—other acts of wrongdoing—such as intercourse between a young man aged almost 20 with a girl aged only just over 13 are excluded from the Bill's provisions. The Government will allow such a 19-year-old to escape registration, so there is an inconsistency, which amendment No. 14 is intended to address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rejected amendment No. 14, but if he applies his mind to it—I know that he is a fair man, and he has tried to be fair in his responses to amendments today—he will have to acknowledge that the Bill as drafted contains an unfairness. He may need to consider whether he is wrongly allowing some people to avoid registration in relation to heterosexual acts, but he should apply his mind to the question of consistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the amendment implied that there should be a change in the age of consent. That is not the case; we have addressed the law as it stands, and have tried to introduce fairness. I turn the Minister's words on himself: if amendment No. 14 were to be regarded as changing the age of consent for gay and lesbian sex from 18 to 16, the Bill would imply that the Minister wants to reduce the age of consent for girls to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>96</span>
13. Is that really what the Minister intends to imply by the Bill? I suspect not, but if we apply the standard that he applied to the amendment to the Bill, that is the result. I ask the Minister to reflect on his reasons for rejecting amendment No. 14 and to reconsider. He said that he is trying to deal intelligently and fairly with our suggestions and it seems sensible to leave the possibility open for him to reconsider the matter. Rather than pressing the amendments to a Division, I shall ask leave of the Committee to withdraw them. I hope that the Minister will accept that further consideration could be given to the amendments on the Floor of the House on Report if he does not table his own amendments to address those issues, which I still hope he might do.

The amendment also originates with discussions with the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Equality Network in Scotland. It would remove from the list of offences requiring registration soliciting or importuning by a male prostitute or living off the earnings of a male prostitute. The corresponding offences in the rest of the United Kingdom do not require registration and the corresponding offences in Scotland relating to a female prostitute do not require registration. As the Minister knows, soliciting or importuning by a male prostitute, or living off the earnings of a male prostitute, are offences under section 13(9) of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995. Under the Bill, as currently drafted, anyone aged 20 or over who is convicted of a sexual offence will be required to register as a dangerous sex offender.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the First schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a few general comments for the Minister to consider. Shameless indecency has been mentioned already, and all my comments on it will relate to Scotland. Although it is a comparatively minor offence, not in the nature of an assault, it is broad and used to prosecute such activities as sex in a public place, indecent exposure and display of indecent material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all such cases, the equivalent English offences do not require registration, yet a person convicted of shameless indecency under the age of 18 will be required to register as a dangerous sex offender. Given the spirit of registration and the need not to clutter such a register, I ask the Minister to reconsider that matter and comment on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sexual activity between men aged under 20 and girls aged 12 to 16 is also dealt with under the schedule. A man convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl aged under 16 is required to register if he is aged 20 or over. That sensibly avoids the situation where, for example, a 17-year-old man who is fined for having consenting sex with his 15-year-old girlfriend is required to register. However, that 17-year-old man engaged in consenting sexual activity, which falls short of intercourse, with the 15-year-old girl, commits the offence of indecent behaviour towards a girl aged between 12 and 16 and can also be charged with shameless indecency. If fined for any such offence, he is required to register as a dangerous sex offender. That aspect of the Bill must be re-examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Equality Network has asked us to consider the issue of incest. There is an anomaly in the Bill between the treatment of incest with a son or daughter and intercourse with a stepson or stepdaughter. Incest with a son or daughter, which is prosecuted under section 1 of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995, is an offence requiring registration if the son or daughter is under the age of 18. By contrast, intercourse with a stepson or stepdaughter, which is prosecuted under section 2 of the 1995 Act, is an offence requiring registration whatever the age of the stepson or stepdaughter. Therefore, there is an inconsistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A man convicted of incest with his 18-year-old daughter is not required to register, but a man convicted of intercourse with his 18-year-old stepdaughter is required to do so. I ask the Minister to reconsider that inconsistency in the spirit that he has shown before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>100</span>
Those offences are not included in the schedule as drafted. They are serious offences and should be included in the Bill. I hope that the Minister will be able to accept the amendments or to assure the Committee that he will consider them. If he can do neither, he must offer some satisfactory explanation to the Committee. The omission of the offences from the Bill seems to cause a series of inconsistencies.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Each of the offences listed in the amendments appears as an offence under the Sexual Offences Act 1956, as the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth said. However, part II is aimed at protecting children under the age of 16 from being abused by paedophiles who are either British citizens or resident in this country and who choose to try and evade the consequences of the law by carrying out these vile acts abroad. The proposals recognise widespread public concern over the phenomenom of so-called child sex tourism, which we are determined to stamp out. The question of taking extra-territorial jurisdiction over such offences required careful thought. The requirement of oral testimony and the right of the defence to cross-examine witnesses is central to criminal trials in this country. It is, therefore, more difficult for us than for many other countries to mount successful prosecutions for offences committed abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth that an interdepartmental review of extraterritorial jurisdiction was established to consider the general position. The review confirmed that there would be considerable practical difficulties in regard to obtaining sufficient evidence from witnesses from abroad, but it concluded that some prosecutions could be successful in certain circumstances. In view of that and of the particularly serious nature of sexual offences against children, we decided that extra-territorial jurisdiction can be justified in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report did not conclude, and neither are we persuaded to the view, that taking extra-territorial jurisdiction should be extended beyond these particularly vile crimes against children. The amendments go far beyond the purpose of the Bill and would extend the range of offences to those who are not the victims of child sex tourism. Of course, many other terrible things are done to children abroad, but those people subsequently returning to this country are not likely to procure young people for prostitution or run brothels. It is not the primary purpose of part II to proceed against such activities, and neither is it likely to be possible to find the necessary evidence in this country to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is not the product of a perfect science, but I think that we have incorporated into the schedule those offences which are most applicable and which will be most effective in dealing with the problem of child sex tourism. I hope that the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth will feel able to withdraw the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled by the Minister's response. He said that there are practical difficulties in obtaining successful prosecutions under the offences listed in the amendments. That was the reason given at a previous sitting for not allowing any extra-territorial jurisdiction, when that was the subject under discussion.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>101</span>
Over a period of time those who appeared reluctant to approve prosecution for such offences were dragged—kicking and screaming, almost—into accepting that some offences should be prosecuted under the provisions of last year's Bill dealing with sex tourism. The Minister is using an argument that was previously used as an obstruction to that legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not true. We were not dragged kicking and screaming. We were determined to ensure that the measure was effective, which is why a thorough review was carried out. We are concerned primarily with extra-territoriality and dealing with paedophile activity. If the measure is drawn wider than that narrow area on which we must act, despite the evidential difficulties which I have acknowledged, it would be much more difficult to achieve a desirable result. No kicking and screaming was involved. We were keen on the measure and this country's international reputation in that respect is extremely good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go over old stories, but I cannot accept that the Government were not dragged kicking and screaming into dealing with sex tourism. I accept the Minister's personal interest in making progress on the matter, but I recall debates with other Ministers and the Government's incredible reluctance to make any progress, which should not be forgotten. Those unacceptable arguments are being rerun today and I cannot accept, in logic or in terms of Government commitment, that the Minister is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that such matters are not to do with child sex tourism, but he should consider the offences. Amendment No. 64 refers to
	<br><q><p>"Abduction of an unmarried girl under 16 from parents or guardian".</p></q>
It is illogical that that should not be listed within the offences that are caught by schedule 2. If it is too difficult successfully to prosecute or to produce the evidence that would satisfy a court in this country a prosecution will not go ahead, or, if it does, will not succeed. That is no reason for not including that offence. The Minister appears to be saying that a working party has considered the matter and chosen what should be in schedule 2, but he does not want to go any further—trust it, trust him. I trust the Minister's good will, but not his judgment on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman does not trust my judgment, because it has just come down on the side of looking again at the list. To demonstrate further that we are not kicking or screaming but keen for the Bill to be successful, I undertake to reconsider the list if he withdraws the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to adjust my view and say that the Minister's judgment has just improved considerably. I am glad that he has responded positively and thank him for doing so—it is a gesture of statesmanship. I hope that that will be followed up positively on the Floor of the House. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 15, in schedule 2, page 14, line 17, leave out "(i)".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
I shall be brief. That amendment would include in the schedule the offence of rape abroad where the victim is over 16. It is an anomaly that the current provisions do not deal with the rape abroad of a British citizen aged over 16 by a British adult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no simple solution to the problem, but the amendment would provide for prosecution and conviction. The Minister's critique—a prosecution would not go ahead if evidence was unavailable—may be applicable in many circumstances, but he should consider the example which I have just given. Evidence and testing of it would be perfectly simple within our legal system whereas the omission of the offence would make it impossible for a prosecution to be mounted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment and, in the spirit of thought that he is displaying in Committee, agree to consider whether there are other omissions. As long as the right hon. Member for Conwy does not disturb him, I hope that he will continue with the consensual approach to the important issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to be accused of entering into any consensual anything with the hon. Gentleman. He is taking the matter too far, however, and is now being churlish and unhelpful. I said that I would be happy further to consider the list in the schedule, but it is essential that the list relates to matters such as paedophilia. That is the purpose of this part of the Bill. If the amendment were agreed to, the courts would acquire extra-territorial jurisdiction over any rape offence, which is not intended. Before I change my judgment I am keen for the hon. Gentleman to reflect further and perhaps withdraw the amendment at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one matter on which the Minister is wrong. If he considers schedule 1, he will find that the first offence referred to is that of rape. The Bill is primarily about paedophilia but it goes wider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking now about schedule 2. We know that there are differences in this part of the Bill and we know of differences in the schedule. The extra-territoriality is a narrower element of the Bill. The first section is concerned with sexual offences in general. That is why rape appears in the first part and why the hon. Gentleman's amendment should not be allowed to include rape in this part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is dancing on the point of a pinhead. The Bill should be targeted specifically at the creation of registration requirements on those who abuse children. That applies to schedule 1 more than it does to schedule 2. The exclusion in schedule 2 seems to be an omission. At this stage, however, I simply appeal to the better nature and judgment that the Minister has demonstrated that he possesses and ask him to consider whether his response is not more negative than it should be. I ask him to deal more sympathetically with this point before Report. We shall consider further whether it should be pursued at that stage. As for today, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
