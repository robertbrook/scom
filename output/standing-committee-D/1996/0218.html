<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>National Health Service (Primary Care) Bill [Lords]</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the National Health Service (Primary Care) Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.—[<i>Mr. Malone.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Tessa Jowell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin by welcoming you, Sir Alan, to the Chair. As we made clear on Second Reading, the Opposition welcome many aspects of the Bill. However, a number of aspects are still insufficiently clear and we are opposed to some aspects of the original proposals.<br><br>
During our proceedings, we shall take the opportunity to recast primary care and, in a measured way, to debate the way in which it will be recast. We welcome the Government's emphasis on phased implementation of pilots because it is essential that continuity of patient care is not jeopardised in the process of change.<br><br>
As we have already made clear, a lot of pain would have been spared in the national health service if the approach taken in the Bill had been applied to implementation of the reforms in 1990. So much energy was expended in that reorganisation that the current demoralisation of the service is felt by many to have had its origins in that process.<br><br>
In considering how much time is needed to debate the Bill, we need to ensure that we return to and fully explore the many points that my hon. Friends raised on Second Reading. That debate covered the essence and context of primary care. I hope that we will have sufficient time to revisit such issues as the recruitment of trainees to general practice. We know that, in many inner-city practices, there is what is approaching a crisis of recruitment and retention. We also want to reexamine the availability of women GPs. It is not acceptable that some patients who want to register with a woman GP cannot do so.<br><br>
Perhaps more than anything else, we want to ensure that the Bill deals with how to confront and get rid of the two-tier NHS. The two-tier NHS has become a hallmark of primary care under the Conservative Government. The chief executive of the hospital that my constituents use—King's College hospital, which is only two or three miles down the road from here said last summer that he could no longer justify the two-tier NHS to the patients who came to his hospital.<br><br>
During our debate on the Bill we must get to grips with why a two-tier NHS has emerged. There are a number of reasons, the most blatant of which is the extent to which GP fundholders can procure faster access for their patients to elective treatment than
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
patients of GPs who are not fundholders. Across the river at the Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham health authority, maximum waiting time for paitents of fundholders is 12 months, but patients of GPs who are not fundholders have to wait up to 18 months for elective treatment in hospital. That inequity, which overrides specific regional needs, results in a two-tier health service and is of enormous concern to patients and those who provide health care.<br><br>
During our debate we are also keen to explore the regional inequity in the distribution of GPs which, again, creates access problems as well as difficulties for GPs in providing proper cover for what might be unacceptably large lists.<br><br>
We also hope to discuss the crisis facing NHS dentistry—a crisis which the Government have so far refused to acknowledge, but which is clearly having an enormous impact in different parts of Britain in terms of the ease with which people can register with an NHS dentist. In towns throughout Britain it is virtually impossible to find an NHS dentist. That is another example of regional inequalities in the availability of primary care.<br><br>
When the time comes, we want to ensure that, despite all the Government's instincts, the possibility of back-door or front-door privatisation of primary care does not arise.<br><br>
The Opposition have exceptionally strong representatives on the Committee to ensure that the Bill receives thorough scrutiny. They include my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Bayley), who also serves on the Health Select Committee; my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm); and my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell), who is unable to be with us until slightly later—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sorry, my hon. Friend is here now. We also have my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Heppell) and my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes), who will ensure that business proceeds expeditiously, but not so expeditiously that we miss any of the points that I have outlined. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan), who speaks from the Front Bench, and my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Dr. Wright), who will join us shortly, complete our team.<br><br>
On Second Reading, we endeavoured to refer the Bill to a Special Standing Committee by means of a committal motion. I hope that some of the achievements that would have been accomplished by three sessions in a Special Standing Committee can be dealt with by the wide debates that we will need to have during the next week or so.<br><br>
We are not satisfied with the Government's handling of the tabling of amendments. That was a specific problem in another place just before Report stage, when some 96 amendments were tabled, half of which were withdrawn, and not all reappeared on Third Reading. We are also concerned about the Government's exact intention in relation to other bodies and privatisation. We should have liked to debate the Bill in a Speical Standing Committee and to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0466">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
have had the opportunity to take evidence in such a forum because the Bill's provisions will work only if they attract the support and confidence of those who work in primary care throughout Britain. I refer not only to general practitioners, but to nurses, midwives, pharmacists and optometrists, whose joint effort enables primary care to be as strong and robust as it needs to be.<br><br>
We support the Bill in many respects. We hope that, subject to the amendments that we want to secure, it will be possible for it to receive Royal Assent before the general election. However, our co-operation is entirely dependent on the spirit of compromise that the Government adopt. We believe that the Bill has significant flaws that will not serve to rebuild primary care. Over the next two weeks we hope to strengthen the Bill by removing those flaws.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Thurnham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bolton, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to be appointed to the Committee under your excellent chairmanship, Sir Alan.<br><br>
I support the Bill's broad aims, but I have received several representations, many of them in the past 24 hours, to which I may refer if that would be helpful. I do not intend to delay the Committee unduly. The hon. Member for Dulwich (Ms Jowell) mentioned regional concerns, which I should like to discuss at an appropriate time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley <span class='memberconstituency'>(York)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Bill makes good progress, but not such good progress that we do not discuss some important questions about primary care, which I raised on Second Reading. The first matter that I raised was equity—the distribution of primary healthcare resources around the country and the distribution of GPs. Committee members will be aware that there is much inequality in the distribution of those resources. The Bill has the potential to reduce that inequality and to increase the number of GPs in areas that have less than their fair share of resources. Such a reform would make it possible for better-resourced areas to increase their distribution still further. I hope that the Government will reassure me that the Bill's purpose is to improve rather than to reduce equity in the distribution of resources.<br><br>
I want to flag up another matter that I raised on Second Reading and to discuss it in slightly more detail. If we are to enter into a different system relating to contracts for primary healthcare services, the Government must be clear about how they will ensure that high-quality and effective services are provided and that those services are cost-effective.<br><br>
I shall give one or two examples of issues that we must debate at some stage during our consideration of the Bill. When the new GP contract was introduced some time ago, an annual domiciliary visit to all patients aged over 75 years was required. Many GPs have complained to me that that is not a cost-effective practice. They understand the healthcare needs of patients whom they see regularly, in surgeries or in patients' homes. The need for an annual domiciliary visit in such cases is not needed on health grounds because GPs are already aware of patients' healthcare needs. However, there is a strong reason for an annual
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
domiciliary visit to those patients who are not regularly seen by GPs. A GP's resources would be used more effectively if they were concentrated on patients whose records were not up to date and about whose healthcare needs the GP was unclear.<br><br>
I hope that if healthcare services are contracted out to third parties—whether to a trust or a private organisation—the terms of contracts will require the providers of primary healthcare services to provide cost-effective services.<br><br>
We should also discuss the advice that the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, which is funded by the Department of Health, gave about cholesterol screening. It advised that blanket screening was highly cost-ineffective because it consumed NHS resources and produced very little health gain, whereas screening of people at risk of heart disease was highly cost-effective. We would want to know that the NHS money going to the primary healthcare teams that had contracted to provide services was spent in accordance with the evidence-based medicine guidelines produced by the Department of Health. That is not clearly stated in the Bill.<br><br>
Minor surgery is another issue that we must discuss. When the health reforms were introduced, the Government encouraged GPs to provide lumps and bumps operations within general practice in the belief that that would be more cost-effective than similar operations in hospital. Yet the growth in minor surgery in general practice seems to have been in addition to the amount of treatment given in hospitals, so those planned savings have not come to fruition. In letting contracts to third parties to provide primary healthcare services, it is important to ensure—my support for the Bill will depend on the Minister's response to this—that the services bought will make ill people better, and that we are not giving subcontractors a licence to spend NHS money, whether or not they provide a cost-effective service.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the spirit of what my hon. Friend the Member for York has just said about the importance of evidence-based medicine, and before we begin to consider the clauses of the Bill, we should form a picture of how the provisions intersect with the great, wide world outside, and try to establish where the gaps, which the Bill should seek to fill, are opening up in medical services.<br><br>
In a recent parliamentary answer to me from the Secretary of State for Health, it emerged that one of those gaps was between primary and secondary care as was highlighted by the rapid rise in the death rate from pneumonia this January compared with previous Januaries. There appear to have been 5,000 additional deaths this January—and that is only a provisional estimate because the figures do not cover the whole of January. What does that tell us about how we should regard the Bill? It tells us that something is breaking down, somewhere between the hospital service and primary care services. Is that because we have not yet sorted out who should be vaccinated against a very virulent strain of influenza such as the Wuhan B strain,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0467">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
which swept through the country from October to January? Is that a problem with which the Bill should deal in order to improve the contract under which GPs are paid to provide influenza vaccine to the appropriate categories of people? Might that have prevented some of the 5,000 additional deaths that occurred last month?<br><br>
It seems evident that something went seriously wrong, either in influenza vaccination or in the ability of hospitals to cope with those who fell ill because they were not vaccinated. The result was a rapid increase in deaths from influenza, but although deaths went up by 1,000 per cent., the figure of 255 was not terribly significant. However, the secondary impact of influenza on pneumonia deaths meant that there were 11,000 deaths this year compared with 6,000 deaths in January two or three years ago.<br><br>
The Bill states how to provide additional contracts, but it is permissive. It permits GPs to volunteer to do certain things and it permits changes to contracts, but is that enough? Should the Bill oblige GPs to undertake certain contracts? Has a new problem emerged in January 1997, right before our eyes, which should make us think seriously about whether we should pass quite such permissive legislation? When there were an additional 5,000 deaths from pneumonia in the month before the Committee stage of the Bill, perhaps we should think seriously about what went wrong and what provisions we should include in the Bill. Perhaps we should think about strengthening some of the clauses so that GPs are obliged to provide vaccines for the appropriate categories of people. They could be paid by means of amendments to the contract. They are not paid for vaccinations now, but are paid a dispensing fee, which is not part of the contract for the provision of primary health care. I have spoken to some public health experts who think that it is time that we thought about that. Doctors are rightly prescribing antibiotics less frequently because of the danger. Antibiotics should not be shoved into everyone because they speed up the emergence of drug-resistant strains of bacteria. However, if one is decreasing the supply of antibiotics, vaccination of appropriate groups of people should be increased. That issue should be covered in the Bill—it is in the woodwork of the Bill, but some clauses require strengthening, in the light of the latest evidence. I am grateful to the Secretary of State for Health for providing me with that evidence, via the Central Statistical Office.<br><br>
One-stop shops for medicne are another issue which we should consider seriously. A general practice may be extended to include dental practitioners, a pharmacist, an optician or even a vet. Are one-stop shops a good idea or a bad idea? One has just opened in Cardiff and I am not sure whether it is a good idea. Is that the kind of pilot scheme that the Government wish to encourage? If so, is that a job for the private sector—GPs in their private capacity—or a job for a revamped health centre, to be provided by public funds? If such a centre is provided privately by the GP, the other health professionals will not be keen because
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
the GP will be in a monopoly position. We need clarification on whether the Government wish to encourage such pilot schemes. In principle, one-stop shops are a good idea because all medical and allied professional services will be available at one location, but who will own the premises and who will gather the rent? A small minority of GPs believe that their practices are their premises and their premises are their pensions. If their premises are also the optician's premises, the pharmacist's premises, the vet's premises and the dentist's premises, those other medical professionals will say, "Why do the GPs always get the rent from the premises?" If one-stop shops are going to be pushed in such a way, should they be run by the private or the public sector? If it is a job for the private sector, which private entity should be in the lead?<br><br>
I have outlined the issues that we should discuss during our proceedings. If we do not, we will be falling down on our job. We have had a hard winter and a virulent flu epidemic. We had a foretaste of it in the winter of 1996 and it has been savage in the winter of 1997. We will not be doing our job property as members of the Committee unless we take evidence from the medical profession. The system has broken down and there have been 5,000 additional deaths from pneumonia in England and Wales in January this year. In my opinion, the Committee should take account of the failures of the system. Taking account of the latest statistics of morbidity and mortality, we should discuss the Bill, clause by clause and line by line, and try to put right what is clearly going wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Alan. First of all, let me say how much I welcome your being in the Chair. From good experience, I know what a reliable and courteous person you are. Over my time here, we have enjoyed a good relationship which is currently under suspension by our parties.<br><br>
I wish to make a few general comments about the Bill. On Second Reading, we welcomed the Bill in general because it provided flexibility in the provision of primary health care. We need to focus on primary care because, too frequently, people focus on secondary care. Dramatic medical incidents are failures that we see in the secondary system. It is important that we are able to focus on the primary system.<br><br>
If we are making the system more flexible, we should debate the limits of that flexibility—who can provide and what might be provided. The Bill deals entirely with principles and arrangements. When the arrangements are made and the Bill is enacted—we are, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich said, anxious to make progress so that that will happen before the general election—we must be aware what effect that will have on our primary care services. The purpose of pilot projects is to give us some experience of the way in which different arrangements work. The problem of some arrangements not working should be tackled at a later stage. I believe that will be carried out by my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich, although some Conservative Members may disagree.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0468">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
We must examine the limits and discuss aspects of the Bill that go beyond them. The Government have excluded some provisions that we believe should be included. The Bill, which in general is about how primary care ought to be organised, should be considered in two ways and I am hopeful we will get a Bill that will provide a more positive service for our people.<br><br>
I join my hon. Friend the Member for York in emphasising our anxiety that we should produce a system that is equitable as between different parts of the country and between patients so that it becomes much les important with which GP patients are registered. We want to see GPs working in a team or group to ensure that when purchasing takes place, it is on behalf of all those served by GPs in a particular area. That is one way to achieve equity.<br><br>
There are a few things that we should explore. I am interested in the extent to which the Government's amendments will remove the idea that GPs can be employed on a commercial basis. The Committee will know from the debate on Second Reading that that was a serious concern of ours. I believe that the Government failed to answer the charge that modifying the clauses—we shall examine how much they have been modified—will be good only for the period up to the election and that, if the Conservative party returns to power at some point, it will continue to pursue commercialisation of the GP service, which was defended by the Secretary of State for Health in the debate on the Queen's Speech. No doubt we shall debate that issue at some length.<br><br>
We should also consider GPs. Something that is not part of the main thrust of the Bill but which was raised, I think, by the hon. Member for Chislehurst (Sir R. Sims) and my hon. Friend the Member for Gower (Mr. Wardell), in an amendment on behalf of the General Medical Council, is the training of GPs. That is relevant to one of the issues tackled in the Bill—the inequitable distribution of general practitioners. We should consider the training issue and make it possible for undergraduates in medical training to do their house jobs in general practice. The present restrictions on that should be explored, but I presume that the Government have not had time to consider the details of an amendment.<br><br>
I have not tabled an amendment because the matter is germane to the main thrust of the Bill and I presume that it should be covered in a new clause. I hope that the Government will consider that because my observations of the way in which Standing Committees are conducted suggest that a new clause from the Opposition would have less chance of success than the Government using Department of Health employees to draft a new clause that fits the points raised in debate.<br><br>
I hope that the matter will be considered. Although it is aside from the main part of the Bill, it is germane to it in the sense that we are all concerned about the shortage of GPs. There has been a large fall in the proportion of medical students who go into general practice instead of hospital consultancy.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
11 am<br><br>
The path taken by graduates is determined to some extent by salaries. I have dealt with chemistry graduates; the number who decided to enter the teaching profession depended on the availability of posts outside the profession and the relative salaries.<br><br>
The way in which the Government have dealt with fundholding has enabled some GPs to invest in their own property and premises. That has made the profession more attractive financially, but has failed to attract students into general practice. We must consider any simple measures that may help to do that.<br><br>
We obviously want to consider the role of other professionals, and amendments have been tabled to enable us to do so. We must consider the part that other professions within the health service can play and the part that we wish them to play. I hope that we shall see some alterations in the Bill.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will explain the financing of the Bill. I referred to that on Second Reading and it was suggested that an extra £6 million would be required, but I do not believe that that will be sufficient if there are to be nationwide pilot studies of a reasonable scale. Health authorities in Yorkshire are short of cash at the moment, expecially my own health authority in Leeds, and I am concerned that they will have to pick up the bill.<br><br>
We shall discuss other issues and I hope that we have a constructive dialogue so that we shall have a primary care system that is more effective that it would be if the Bill were simply passed without serious consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mr. Gerald Malone)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Sir Alan. I reiterate some of the messages from Opposition Members. I welcome the broad principles of the constructive approach to the legislation taken by the hon. Member for Dulwich. This is the first time, almost since the inception of the health service, that the House has had the opportunity to debate in Committee a very detailed proposal for the reform of primary care. A Bill such as this, based on a consultative exercise across the range of professionals who work in primary health care, deserves the constructive approach set out by the hon. Lady and I welcome that. I do not intend to introduce my team by name—Conservative Members will make themselves well known to the Committee during its proceedings, as their talents speak entirely for themselves.<br><br>
I shall be happy to deal with some of the detailed points raised by Opposition Members, especially with the intriguing interventions which I expect from the hon. Member for Cardiff, West, who I am delighted to see in the Committee. You might not be aware, Sir Alan that when I last served on a Committee with the hon. Gentleman—during proceedings on the Health Authorities Bill—not only were his remarks interesting but he made a great contribution to English literature. I thought that he had coined a phrase that I had never heard before when he discussed healthcare professionals. He spoke of "herding cats in a thunderstorm". Since he uttered that phrase, it has come into common use and I cannot quite work out whether it was coined by the hon. Gentleman, who as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0469">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
its author would have made a significant contribution to English Literature, or whether I simply had not noticed the phrase before. I am sure that his contributions now will be as effective as they were then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot claim originality for the phrase, but I remember the Minister thanking me for it during consideration of another Bill when he said that it had helped him to prepare his speech for a Burns night supper.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the National Health Service (Primary Care) Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill. Copies are available in the Room. I also remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that might be reached during an afternoon sitting.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>'or services under section 1(1)(c) of this Act'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that general nurses, health visitors, midwives and community nurses can propose pilot schemes in their own right, instead of doing it through a GP or an NHS trust. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State appeared to suggest that the Bill already allowed for that. We might debate a Government new clause on the issue later in our proceedings, but there is a clear opinion among those who represent the interests of nursing in its broadest possible sense that the Bill does not make it possible for nurses to initiate and be in charge of pilots.<br><br>
The barriers in the Bill to nurses acting independently of GPs and trusts to initiate pilot schemes are numerous. First, in clause 1(3), nursing services are identified as services which are not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
personal medical or personal dental services, but which may be provided under part I of the National Health Service Act 1977 or the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978. However, subsection (3) provides that pilot schemes may include arrangements for the provision of such services. Nursing services could be part of the wider pilot, but nurses acting alone cannot propose a pilot scheme.<br><br>
The second barrier appears in clause 2, which sets out the duties of health authorities to consider pilot schemes that are submitted to them by qualified persons, and to prepare proposals for submissions to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
Clause 2(7) defines "qualified person" as
<br><blockquote><p>"an NHS trust or a person who is"</p></blockquote>
a medical practitioner or a dental practitioner. Amendment No. 41 adds nurses to the list of qualified persons. Currently, nurses wishing to take up pilot schemes would have to do so via a doctor or an NHS trust, thus restricting both the potential of the Bill and, the Opposition believe, many of the opportunities for diversity in primary care that the Government intend.<br><br>
Failure to amend the Bill in the light of those concerns would work against the grain of the provision of much that is best in nurse-led primary care at present. Not far from here we can find nurses leading a comprehensive healthcare project for homeless people. That approach could be generalised to the benefit of homeless people in different parts of the country.<br><br>
For example, a team of health visitors, community mental-health nurses, school nurses and nurse practitioners could contract with the health authority to deliver a wide range of healthcare services for homeless families and individuals who, for whatever reason, are unable to register with a GP. The team could contract with or employ a medical practitioner as appropriate, and the range of services provided by nurses working in that way could include health promotion, family planning, social support and care for acute illnesses, as well as support with chronic conditions such as asthma.<br><br>
On Second Reading in another place, the Under-Secretary, Baroness Cumberlege, paid fulsome tribute to the contribution of nurses. I hope that you, Sir Alan, will forgive me as I squint at my script because the font that I chose on my word processor turned out to be almost unreadable. The Under-Secretary acknowledged that
<br><blockquote><p>"The nursing profession already plays a major and growing part in the delivery of primary care."</p></blockquote>
She added:
<br><blockquote><p>"We want to encourage that trend and also greater integration of the different primary healthcare professions. Our proposals will enable nurses to develop proposals with GPs which include a range of services in which they take a lead, such as child health clinics or monitoring of asthma."—[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 3 December 1996; Vol. 576, c. 591]</p></blockquote>
Both White Papers that preceded the legislation—"Choice and Opportunity" and "Primary Care: Delivering the Future"—identify major new opportunities for the development of nursing for the benefit of patients. It is, therefore, inconsistent—we hope it is no more than an oversight—that clause 2(7) as currently drafted excludes midwives and nurses as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0470">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
qualified persons. In clause 1, there is no explicit mention of nursing in the opening definition of pilots. It is not enough simply to imply that nurses are eligible. The eligibility of nurses across the range of the discipline needs to be explicitly reflected in the Bill. That is the purpose of the amendments.<br><br>
We know that the Minister for Health has been labouring under the impression that the shortage of nurses in the late 1990s is to do with their Hattie Jacques image. Perhaps he regrets that remark, which was no doubt made in the wake of the Christmas turkey. We recognise that the reasons for the crisis lie nearer to the Minister's backyard than Hattie Jacques's forays up the Khyber or the Nile.<br><br>
A recent survey by the <i>Nursing Times and Nursing Mirror</i> revealed the extent of demoralisation among nurses and the fact that 77 per cent. of interviewees believed that the NHS would be privatised. A disturbing proportion of respondents said that they would leave nursing if they were able to do so. I assume that those findings come as no surprise to the Minister or to anyone else.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
About 25,000 nurses left the profession in 1995. The rate of exodus has simply not been matched by the rate of recruitment. In 1987, 37,000 newly qualified nurses started work, and in 1997 that figure had fallen to 9,000. The tragedy behind those figures is the fact that the departure of unprecedented numbers of nurses from their profession is occurring at a time when new opportunities for nurses are now available—when the green shoots, as it were, are now visible. We believe that one way to stem that exodus this side of the general election—and before the return of a Labour Government who are committed to rebuilding the NHS—is to make explicit the fact that nurses should be able to adopt a position in primary care pilot schemes that is equal with doctors, professionals and other peers.<br><br>
I shall return briefly to the background of the demoralisation that is so prevalent in nursing. We have seen reports from trusts about the increased use of short-term contracts—as a result of which many nurses find it difficult to get mortgages—and the imposition of divisive and ultimately ineffective local pay bargaining arrangements. Nurses repeatedly complain about those matters and the bureaucracy that is associated with the internal market; they say that those matters interfere with the relationship that they need to establish with their patients, which is their principal reason for working in the NHS.<br><br>
We hope that the Government understand the strength of the arguments that are vested in our amendments. We tabled them as part of our commitment to rebuild the NHS and because they are essential to exploit the potential benefits of the Bill. The Royal College of Midwives and the community practitioners and health visitors associations have supported our approach.<br><br>
I must refer briefly to one or two of the points that were made in a letter from the Royal College of Midwives. The letter made it clear that the college wanted midwives—who are already independent
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
practitioners—to develop their service within the NHS and to help with the development of the new pilot initiatives in primary care. That would be entirely consistent with the spirit of change in childbirth, which is meant to centre the practice of midwifery on women and their new babies, ensuring continuity of care throughout the process of pregnancy, delivery and post partum care. We believe that midwifery would be supported in ensuring that continuity of care and in achieving the objectives of changing childbirth practices if the Government accept the amendments to enable midwives to establish pilots in their own right.<br><br>
In conclusion, we hope that the omission of such provisions from the Bill was an oversight rather than an intention. We want the legislation to work and we want it to work for many years. We do not want nurses and midwives to have to refer to <i>Hansard</i> in order to argue their case in securing equity with doctors—their professional colleagues—which will be the consequence of failing to incorporate the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to elaborate on the point about midwives. Members of the Committee might have seen correspondence from the Royal College of Midwives. It makes a strong case for amendment No. 41 which would add midwives to page 3 line 18 of clause 2. We are talking about including people who are registered and who are, therefore, fully accepted as health professionals in their own right. In one sense, their professionalism does not depend on any other profession—it has been demonstrated that they are, as individuals, fully capable of carrying out their tasks. Many of us know to our benefit that midwives are used to taking charge of situations. Their work for the most part passes off extremely smoothly. We see the results of that but often forget the skill that enables a mother to give birth. It is important to recognise that we depend on the skill of midwives at critical times in our lives.<br><br>
As midwives are part of an independent body and are professionals who practise independently, we should recognise that it is possible to have midwife-led pilots in their area of expertise. There must be a demonstrable reason why that cannot be the case. The Government made it clear in another place that they would not accept an amendment with such a purpose, though the implication was that the Secretary of State might be prepared to grant midwives the ability to start a pilot without it being explicit in the Bill. It is an important matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich mentioned morale in the profession and how different professions viewed each other's standing in the NHS. The matter should be resolved and can be easily resolved in the Bill.<br><br>
As midwives practise independently, they are able to draw up contracts as self-employed professionals. Anyone, especially mothers, can recognise distinctive practices of midwifery. Midwives are prevented from drawing up contracts with NHS practices or fundholders, but amendment No. 41 would ensure that they could set up health projects in their own right and remain part of the national health service.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0471">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
The Royal College of Midwives strongly supports the principle that primary care should reflect the needs of local people and that those needs are best provided by those who are closest to people locally. One of the functions of midwives is to ensure prior to a birth that arrangements are satisfactory and that the patient will be fully cared for with back-up arrangements in case of unforeseen circumstances. They have an important role and I accept what midwives say, which is that maternity care provides an ideal opportunity for a model primary care service and allows pregnancy and birth to be removed from illness-centred hospitals to family-centred community services. Most patients would have to travel shorter distances and a relationship would develop between the professionals and the mothers before the birth, so that they would usually be attended by people they know.<br><br>
At present, midwives are prohibited from contracting directly with purchasers. Those health bodies which can contract with purchasers are listed in clause 4 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990. The Bill does not allow midwives or certain other health professionals to set up pilot schemes.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will accept an amendment to bring midwives as well as nurses into that category. It would provide midwives with the opportunity to conduct a pilot scheme to show that they could offer a cost-effective service which, because it would be close to the mothers in a community, would demonstrate the value of such a scheme. I believe that if one or two such pilot schemes were set up, they would result in a change of practice in the longer term and would bring the birth process closer to normal community and family life instead of taking place in hospitals which are often at a distance. The professionalism of midwives and those in the team would ensure that if extreme steps were necessary during the birth process, they would be available. Such a service would be welcome to a large proportion of the 750,000 mothers who give birth every year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments go to the heart of one of the important issues in the Bill. They seek to test the Government's attitude to primary care and whether nursing, in particular, and the other professions allied to medicine are subordinate professions or professions in their own right. Are nurses merely doctors' assistants, to put it bluntly, or are they practitioners of a different kind with a different training, who do a different job? I believe that they are the latter. To generalise, doctors are trained to and are extremely good at diagnosing illness and prescribing courses of treatment; nurses are extremely good at providing continuing courses of treatment and helping people with chronic diseases to live with their conditions or disabilities. They are different professions; nurses are not doctors' assistants and they should not be treated as such. For example, when the Select Committee on Health carried out its study of community care for the long-term seriously mentally ill, it was clear that the key health professional for such people was the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
community psychiatric nurse, not the GP. If such people are to receive the necessary continuing care in the community, they require the regular support of the CPN. That is critical and it would be perfectly proper to carry out a pilot study, devised and led by nurses, on improving primary care for a group of people in the community who, I am sure we all agree, do not currently receive the standard of community care that they should.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich mentioned provision of care to homeless people and families, which is another good example. A third example might be the provision of care for travellers. One can think of several areas in which the most appropriate health care might be a nurse-led and nurse-provided service, but the Bill does not make provision for nurses to lead such pilot studies.<br><br>
We often talk glibly about "the health team" and have done so for many years. Back in the early 1970s, I remember rescuing a medical student publication called "Health Team", edited by a liberal young medical student called James Le Fanu, who is now an eminent medical journalist for <i>The Daily Telegraph.</i> People talk now about the health team but when a White Paper on primary care is issued or when a primary care Bill is proposed, the documents relate to doctor-led services. That is what is wrong with the Bill.<br><br>
I looked at the White Paper and started reading the introduction, which says nice things about nurses. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"nurses, midwives and health visitors and the professions allied to medicine…have an equally important part to play"—</p></blockquote>
equally important to doctors, dentists, optometrists and community pharmacists—
<br><blockquote><p>"in providing primary care and the changes proposed have implications for them both in their wider involvement in any pilots which are subsequently introduced following legislation but also in the opportunities which different approaches may offer to develop further the team based approach which is essential to good quality primary care."</p></blockquote>
I carried on reading the White Paper: the first chapter was about GPs; the second chapter was about community pharmacy and optometry; the third chapter was about dentistry. Nurses are used to being relegated to the back end of the document, so I looked for the chapter on nursing, but it was not there. There were warm words in the introduction but the meat was missing, and the meat is also missing from the Bill. The Government's approach is patronising, giving a pat on the back to the good old nurses who help out and support pilot schemes led by other professions. It is not good enough.<br><br>
The Bill is an enabling one. In his opening remarks, the Minister rightly said that the Bill is the first primary legislation for 50 years that addresses the needs of primary care in the NHS. If the Bill is passed—I hope that it will be, with some amendment—it will stand on the statute book as the key part of primary-care legislation for many years to come.<br><br>
If we do not take the opportunity to include in the Bill the fact that pilot studies and developments in primary care can be proposed and led by nurses, we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0472">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
miss an opportunity. It does not mean that every nurse-proposed scheme would be a good scheme that should run, but all schemes would be assessed to check whether they made sense and the good schemes would run and the poor schemes would not. The pilot schemes that ran well would be replicated elsewhere throughout the health service. Those that did not work in practice would not be replicated.<br><br>
The Bill should state what we have been saying for many years, which is that primary health should be provided by a team of health professionals with different training, skills and perspectives. Both the Government and the Opposition support a primary care-led NHS. The Bill mentions not a primary care-led NHS, but a GP-led general practice, a dentist-led general dental practice, optometrist-led optometry and a community pharmacist-led community pharmacy. However, it does not mention nurse-led nursing interventions in primary care, which it should. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich tabled the amendments and I urge the Committee to support them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Tony Wright <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise with a certain diffidence because I recall that, during the closing, rhetorical passage of the Minister's speech on Second Reading, when it was reaching its orgasmic phase, my name was invoked to suggest my extraordinarily lavish support for the measure. The Minister made a remark, which, personally, I did not find entirely helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I have not destroyed the hon. Gentleman's career.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Wright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was destroyed long before that.<br><br>
The Bill provides an apportunity to operate primary care differently—in different ways and in different places. I wanted to ensure that the opportunity was taken. As my hon. Friend the Member for York said, there is a paradox: we have a primary care Bill which in some ways, is not about primary care. The Bill is about doctors, dentists and other discrete professionals, but does not allow for nurse-led primary care. Yet we know that the running together of primary care with general practice is misconceived. As has been said many times, 90 per cent. of primary care is purveyed not by GPs, but by other health professionals, of whom nurses are a major group.<br><br>
There is a spirit of opportunity in the way in which nursing is developing and being encouraged to develop—for example nurses being allowed to prescribe. Such developments show the way and need to be encouraged and the Bill should be able to build on them.<br><br>
My constituency is one in which nurse-led primary healthcare team might be expecially useful—other hon. Members have mentioned other examples. I am glad to record that my area has received a large amount of single regeneration budget money from the Government. It is a former coal-mining area with high levels of deprivation, poverty and social distress. One of the opportunities that has become available through the SRB money, and one of the most exciting things about it, has been the development of new
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
partnerships between the public and private sectors and between different providers in the public sector. Health has been a component of that. It is impossible to consider regeneration without considering health regeneration—how can unhealthy people living in poor areas be enabled to become healthier?<br><br>
The Bill would provide major opportunities, building on such programmes and injections of resources, to develop exciting primary care projects which would be nurse led in many respects, were that possible. Nurses could open projects on certain estates and in certain areas as they do with mental illness, which is extraordinarily difficult to deal with on a continuing basis in conventional ways.<br><br>
It is not good enough for the Government to say that some projects can happen now under existing arrangements—they are not happening now. A new framework is required. I suggest that not to recognise the possibilities of nurse-led primary care teams is not to recognise what the Bill could do. It is certainly true, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich said, that such a measure would provide an enormous tonic to the profession, which is no mean consideration. More than that, it would provide an enormous tonic for the people who are in need of nurse-led primary care. We should resist any move that would prevent the provision of such a tonic. There is an oddity in that the Government have assured us that nothing could be further from their mind than to prevent such developments, but no explicit encouragement for nurse-led primary care exists in the Bill.<br><br>
I retract nothing from my original effusive welcome for the Bill and for the opportunities that it provides, but if we do not explicitly build in nurse-led primary care, an opportunity would be wasted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Heppell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not speak for long as my hon. Friends have covered most of the points that I wanted to raise.<br><br>
There was some discussion in another place—I think on Report—that the Bill should be called the national health service (primary health care) Bill. I understand that idea—people wanted to emphasise that the Bill dealt with primary health care and not just primary care. If we do not accept the amendments, the current title is quite sufficient—the Bill effectively ignores nurses and other health professionals. It will be a wasted opportunity if we do not include a measure to ensure that other health professionals can enjoy the same opportunities as GPs and trusts. At present, the Bill is in danger of saying to people, "Here is primary health care, but you must come and get it. You've got to go to the GP or to the trust to get that." We need a primary healthcare service that takes people into the community. Yesterday I visited a Salvation Army home—Sneinton house—which is on my patch. It deals with people who have become homeless, usually as a result of financial pressures, alcohol problems, gambling, the break-up of their marriage or family, or a combination of those reasons. I can almost guarantee the Committee that no one person I saw in the shelter was registered with a GP. Their health care
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0473">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
has to come from someone else and they will not go to hospital. Their primary health care needs to be administered by someone going to them.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
When we talk about services for which nurses could contract, we are not just talking about services for the most vulnerable people at the bottom of the scale like the homeless—people we may walk away from in the street because they are often nasty and abusive. A constituent writes to me regularly on animal welfare issues expressing her concern about animal experiments. However, she also writes about the homeless, saying that they should be driven off the streets. I sometimes wish she had the same compassion for human beings as she has for animals.<br><br>
Vulnerable people will suffer, but many other people also need the services of nurses and health professionals that they cannot get through a GP or a trust. For one reason or another many people are not registered with a GP. The Committee may think that strange but I have an example of why it may occur. My mother-in-law recently moved to Nottingham from Liverpool. It was three months before she was able to register on a GP's list and then it was only because my wife intervened—she knows the system fairly well as she is a local councillor and knows how things work. It makes me wonder how many other people encounter the same problem.<br><br>
The problem of obtaining primary health care is experienced not just by the homeless, travellers or the most vulnerable, but by lots of other people in the community. Nurses could establish team schemes for health promotion, family planning, social support and care, care for acute conditions and chronic illnesses such as asthma, screening programmes, health education and a 24-hour emergency mental health service. Many schemes could be organised without a GP's involvement. I hope that the Minister will not rule that out for the future.<br><br>
The amendments are backed by the Royal College of Nursing and the Community Practitioners and Health Visitors Association which refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"unprecedented disinvestment in community nursing"</p></blockquote>
and gives examples of where that has happened across the country. We should ensure that the people who make decisions about where primary healthcare resources go are not just GPs, fundholders or trusts. The people who are involved with a great deal of primary health care—the nurses—should also be consulted.<br><br>
A registered nurse should be recognised as a qualified person with the same rights and responsibilities as GPs and others to take part in pilot schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I read the amendments I found that they were familiar and I thought that I had read them elsewhere in correspondence. They reflect an on-going debate about the role of primary care and the role of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
nursing and other professions. I am happy to respond to the points made by the hon. Member for Dulwich and her hon. Friends.<br><br>
First, I very much endorse the contribution that the nursing profession already makes to primary healthcare provision and reinforce the Government's view that that contribution should be consolidated and built upon when the legislation is enacted.<br><br>
Opposition members of the Committee offered several good examples. The hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South spoke of how midwifery had developed and of the role that midwives could play. I agree with him. There are some excellent examples. In total fundholding purchasing schemes, midwife-led schemes that are rooted in primary care provide a seamless service for the prospective mother and it is delivered closer to home. Such schemes should not be flowing against the tide of the structure within the NHS but should be much more a part of it.<br><br>
The hon. Member for York spoke about community practice nurses. In my constituency, community practice nurses often work as equal partners with doctors and other members of the primary healthcare team to tackle the problems and causes of health difficulty that conventional mechanisms often do not reach. One example in my constitutency is of a scheme funded by development money from the health authority. The homeless are targeted as being suitable for such a scheme. their needs can be met in a way that is different from conventional methods of delivering primary care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I did not enunciate my words clearly enough. I was not talking about community practice nurses but community psychiatric nurses, who provide care for the long-term mentally ill in the community. Because that service is usually provided by a community trust or, in some cases, by a joint acute and community trust, it is not a service that can be driven as a pilot from general practice: it would have to come from the trust. Why should it not be a nurse-led proposal from the trust instead of one that is doctor led?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not weaken the point that I shall make later, which is that, under the proposals before the Committee, it can be nurse led. I shall try to reassure the hon. Gentleman about that.<br><br>
I did not pick up entirely clearly what he said. I illustrated a parallel scheme and I think that the two go hand in hand. In some circumstances, a member of the medical profession might find it difficult to participate whereas the nursing profession may be prepared to take a lead.<br><br>
I accept the points made by Opposition members of the Committee that our aim should be for professionals, with their own professional competences and identities, to work together—as the hon. Member for York said—as part of a primary healthcare team. That was the whole thrust of the listening exercise and the documents that followed it. The hon. Gentleman may have been slightly unfair not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0474">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
to have examined all that has been talked about in primary care and to have picked only a part of a document in isolation.<br><br>
If there is any doubt about this issue, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I have made it clear throughout the exercise that the scope for nurses to continue to widen their role and to provide a more prominent and greater share of care to the benefit of patients has been at the core of the aims of the legislation.<br><br>
The Bill will provide an impetus for that development to continue to grow. It has already been seen in several ways across the country. The Bill already provides for nurses to put forward proposals for pilot schemes. We listened carefully to several concerns that were rightly put forward by the profession about the context in which the proposal is developing. They sought reassurance on that matter and hoped that relevant provisions would be included in the Bill. I hope to persuade the Committee that amendments that we have tabled will effectively do that and meet the aims of Opposition Members.<br><br>
New clauses 15 and 16, which we shall discuss later, will give nurses—be they practice nurses or those who are employed by NHS trusts—a guaranteed right, as members of the NHS family, to have their proposals put forward to the Secretary of State. I hope that Opposition Members welcome that guarantee. During our discussions with the profession, it became clear that sensitivities were involved about who had the automatic right to have pilot proposals considered. In those discussions, I was happy to accept that it was important for all those in the NHS family to have that right. When they are approved, nurses may hold the contract for the pilot scheme either in partnership with other members of the primary healthcare team or by themselves. That is a matter for those running the scheme to decide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is easier if I intervene briefly at this stage rather than give another speech later. I know that we cannot presently discuss the new clauses that the Minister mentioned, but my understanding of them is that they will allow nurses who are employed by trusts to put forward proposals. However, I believe that such provision is not made for nurses who are employed by health authorities or—since the Minister raised the matter—practice nurses in primary care. Will he broaden the scope of the Government's proposals so that, as he said, all nursing members of the NHS family can put forward proposals?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that that is the case. Later, we shall debate in detail the relevant implications. I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman has clearly understood the purpose behind the new clauses. All those who are qualified nurses and who provide a nursing service will be able to bring forward pilot schemes.<br><br>
This touches on the point that the hon. Member for Dulwich raised about qualified persons, which is dealt with in clause 2. Perhaps it will help the hon. Gentleman if I deal with that matter. Amendments
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
Nos. 99, 100 and 101 give clear notice of our intention to do away with the qualified persons provisions in their current form. The amendments will ensure that nurses, like all other members of the NHS family, have a guaranteed right to put forward their proposals. I hope that he accepts my assurance that the intention behind the amendments and the new clauses is to ensure that everyone in the NHS family—whatever their status or employment—can put forward pilot proposals of their own. Their ability to do so will be based on their status within the NHS family. We do not intend to make exclusions.<br><br>
I must set on record the fact that pilot schemes must demonstrate clearly how those leading the pilot schemes intend to involve doctors or dentists in the delivery of the scheme's personal medical or dental services. That is a sensible approach. If they bring forward a proposal that involves the delivery of personal medical services that they do not have the confidence to deliver, it makes sense for them to deal with the matter and to put together the components of the primary healthcare team that will ultimately deliver the whole service to the public.<br><br>
Last week, I met representatives from the nursing profession and we discussed these concerns at length. We had a helpful discussion, not only about the principles involved in taking part in pilot schemes, which I acknowledged would need to be enshrined in the Bill—and we reached a consensus about how those technicalities should be addressed—but we discussed some of the practical ways in which schemes could be set up. I asked representatives of the nursing profession to put flesh on the bones of the legislation and to think hard about the sort of schemes in which they would like to participate.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, met representatives of the RCN in Scotland on Friday afternoon, and they were pleased with the developments that resulted from the Minister's meetings with the national RCN last week. However, they had two particular concerns, which they asked me to raise. I do not know whether arrangements will be different in England and Scotland, but they told me that, in Scotland, applications for the first pilots had to be submitted by April. Secondly, and more fundamentally, they were worried that a full range of pilots might not be selected for the first year in Scotland. They had been told that there would probably be a couple of pilots for each health board and they were worried that the nursing pilots might be squeezed out. I am sure that the Minister can comment only on arrangements for England, but it may help if he could clarify the details of implementation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reporting the positive way in which the profession in Scotland has accepted the Government's decision to table new clauses and amendments on that point.<br><br>
I cannot give any firm undertakings about the pace at which pilots will be introduced in Scotland but it is my intention that a full range of pilots should receive
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0475">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
full consideration, and not simply be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis, so that anyone who can cobble together a scheme and have it accepted by the Secretary of State bars other schemes.<br><br>
We want a full range of pilot schemes and we are in the process, independently of the passage of this legislation, of looking at the criteria for evaluating pilot proposals, which will take time. I shall pass on the comments of the hon. Member for Leith to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland, but I will try to set the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest because I believe we have a common view on each side of the border in seeking a full range of schemes for approval. The whole purpose of the legislation is not to narrow the breadth of proposals that are put to the respective Secretaries of State but to widen them as much as we can.<br><br>
I turn briefly to the substance and technical details of the amendments. Amendment No. 41 is, I believe, overtaken by the new provisions that we have tabled. Amendment No. 30 and the consequential amendments would extend piloting to cover all services that fall within part I of the National Health Service Act 1977. I suggest to the hon. Member for Dulwich that this is unnecessary. There is nothing to prevent nurses from putting forward proposals for such part I services to their local health authority. Arrangements for the provision of services under part I are extremely flexible and there is no need for primary legislation of the sort provided for in the Bill for innovative services under that part of the Act to be piloted and evaluated. It would be curious if we were to include in the Bill inflexibility in respect of a range of primary care activities that are currently undertaken under the 1977 Act.<br><br>
I look forward to seeing nurses and other healthcare professionals involved in the delivery of primary health care using the legislation as a way forward to expand their professional horizons and to deliver better quality care to people locally. That is the purpose of the Bill and I hope that I have persuaded the hon. Member for Dulwich that we have listened carefully to the arguments from the professions, which she and her hon. Friends have properly reiterated this morning. I asure her that our amendments—they have already been tabled, so hon. Members may read them—will give effect to the principles that she and her colleagues have enunciated today, so the Opposition amendments are unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his clarification of the points that I and my hon. Friends raised during this important debate. There is always a problem when, as in Alice in Wonderland, words mean what people want them to mean. This has been the first stage of the debate and we shall return to it when we discuss the Government's amendments.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for York has made it clear that we want to be absolutely certain that we enable nurses to take their place as equals with other members of the NHS family. Doctors can make contracts with nurses for nursing services, and nurses
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
should be able to contract with doctors for general or personal medical services. We want to be certain that parity exists in the Bill with no shadow of doubt.<br><br>
My hon. Friends have described the different ways in which the boundaries of primary care are being pushed outwards by exciting nursing-led innovations which demonstrate the possibility of new flexibility in the arrangements for primary health care. At Dulwich hospital in my constituency, Byron ward provides a nurse-led rehabilitation service for elderly people who might otherwise find themselves discharged, only to be re-admitted to hospital.<br><br>
Earlier this morning, my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) and I launched a recuperation service which, if Labour wins the forthcoming election, will be implemented, initially on a pilot basis, across the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If Labour wins the next election, we shall need a massive recuperation service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members will find time for recovery in Opposition.<br><br>
The important and serious point is that there is a gap in health service provision. We all have reason to be concerned about the number of very elderly people who are re-admitted to hospital within 28 days. Organisations such as Age Concern and the Carers National Association, which have a proud record of supporting elderly people and working at the leading edge of services for elderly people, all testify to the gap in the provision for elderly people.<br><br>
Nurses have a vital role to play in bringing recuperation services back into the NHS. We want to ensure that such a new approach to care could be piloted under the provisions of the Bill.<br><br>
I was interested that the Minister said that the Government did not intend to make exclusions in approving pilots. In later discussions of the Bill, we shall return to that issue, and press the many questions that we have about the number, geographical spread and length of time of pilots. Who leads pilots and whether the whole primary care team will have the option of leading them is only one part of the issue. It is important that we legislate for diversity and flexibility, not inflexibility.<br><br>
I was impressed by the Minister's determination that the points raised in the amendments would be met by subsequent Government amendments and new clauses. On the basis of his assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 2, line 15, leave out 'A Health Board' and insert `another Health Authority'.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are probing amendments. I wish to ask questions about conflicts that could arise if there were cross-border pilots. There are different legislative systems in Scotland and England, with different payment arrangements, complaints systems; ombudsmen and so on.<br><br>
I emphasise that the amendments are probing amendments. In principle, we have no objection to cross-border pilots as we firmly believe in partnership between Scotland and England in all matters. There is absolutely no intention to refortify Hadrian's Wall. Such problems are resolved in GP practices that have patients in Scotland and England. Are such arrangements in place for the pilots? Not only single practices but groups of practices may be affected by the pilots. Practices in England could be grouped with several practices in Scotland.<br><br>
It is regrettable that the Minister responsible for health in Scotland—the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)—is not present. No one likes to criticise him—that is one of his great political strengths—but I hope that he is not sulking in his tent after the problems that he experienced at the Scottish Grand Committee. I suppose that his problems were my fault because I asked him a simple and short question, namely, whether the Govenment would rule out a manifesto pledge to privatise clinical services. Perhaps he made the mistake of telling the truth. He said, "No", which appeared all over the Scottish media this morning. No doubt he is trying to clear up the mess. I do not know whether he is a member of the Committee, since the Minister for Health did not introduce the Conservative Members. He said that they would speak for themselves. Perhaps we shall hear from them at some point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The list of members has been published. It is clear that the Minister of State, Scottish Office, is not a member of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assumed that, although I have not seen the list. I hope that some Scottish civil servants are present and I should be grateful if the Minister could answer my question when he replies.<br><br>
Historically, there have been two separate legislative systems. There have been two separate consultation procedures and two different sets of White Papers. To be fair, we had a common White Paper, "Choice and Opportunity", but the Scottish equivalent of the second English White Paper, "Primary Care: Delivering the Future", has not yet been issued in Scotland.<br><br>
We require more information about the practical implications of the Bill. It would have been helpful if the Minister responsible for health in Scotland had been present to tell the Committee about that. I am told by GPs in Scotland that the consultation procedures there are not so advanced as those in England. The RCN raised that point with me on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
Friday. It is a question not only of consultation but of implementation. I have already raised with the Minister the question of implementing the proposals, especially nursing pilot schemes. It is understandable that the Minister, notwithstanding his Scottish background, was not familiar with the intricacies of the Scottish Office. It is regrettable that the Scottish Office Minister is not a member of the Committee which is considering a Bill that deals with the Scottish and English health services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The substance of the points that the hon. Gentleman raised will be covered later when we deal with geographical spread and evaluation. I shall be happy to deal with those matters in detail.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The probing amendments were tabled because we have two different health systems. That is nothing new and should be emphasised to a Committee which has so many English members. It is relevant to other matters that will be discussed on the Floor of the House on Thursday and, no doubt, during the election campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Devlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that I serve on the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs and am regularly in Scotland. Indeed, I imagine that that is probably why I am a member of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He wants to be a Scottish Office Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fortunately, we will not need Conservative Scottish Ministers soon.<br><br>
Historically, there have been two different health systems. That arrangement back to the inception of the NHS. Last year, people in England celebrated the 50th anniversary of the National Health Service Act 1946 whereas, in Scotland, we are this year celebrating the 50th anniversary of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947. That reminds us that health and the other responsibilities of the Scottish Office have been devolved for far longer than 50 years. That is the beginning of the whole argument about devolution. Many people in England do not realise that and some of the pronouncements that are made about devolution assume that we already have a simple unitary state. The reality is that we have had administrative devolution for more than 100 years. It is to democratise that system and make it more effective that we have advanced proposals for constitutional reform based on a power sharing Parliament in Edinburgh and, indeed, also in Cardiff—my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West will talk about that in a moment.<br><br>
It is important to make that point because people who assume that health service arrangements in Scotland and England are the same may find it strange that we have tabled these probing amendments. Indeed, the Secretary of State for Scotland has given belated recognition to the different arrangements. The White Paper on the health service that was issued last
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0477">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
Friday suggested that the national health service for Scotland should be called the Scottish health service. Various similar changes have been made recently to try and make the Scottish Conservative party appear more Scottish, although we would argue that such moves are merely cosmetic and that a real Scottish health service would have to be properly scrutinised and dealt with by a Scottish Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Devlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we had a devolved Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh with the powers of the Scottish Office, would the Scottish Minister for health—presumably there would be such a person—report and be accountable to the Scottish or British Parliament, or would there be two Ministers, one in each?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that is clear; health would be devolved to the Scottish Parliament, so the Scottish Health Minister would be a member of that Parliament. Conservative Members seem to have difficulty with that. They seem to think that the centralised state that we have is a common arrangement throughout the world. However, the power-sharing arrangements that we are suggesting are common in other European countries, the United States and many other countries. The Conservative party is stuck with a centralised model of the state and we are suggesting power-sharing arrangements in its place.<br><br>
Health in Scotland will be debated fully. It is politically significant that the Scottish Health Minister is not here today. In Westminster, Scottish health does not get the attention that it deserves. I have been a Front Bench spokesman on health for only eight months, and until this moment I have had no opportunity in Parliament to discuss Scottish health. There has not been a debate about Scottish health on the Floor of the House that I can remember. The Secretary of State claims that the Scottish Grand Committee has dealt with the problem, but there has not been a debate about Scottish health in that Committee either, certainly not in my time as a Front Bench spokesman or for several months before my appointment. Scottish health is not being dealt with properly—it does not receive adequate scrutiny or debate. That is the problem with the Scottish Office—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Hendry <span class='memberconstituency'>(High Peak)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to both Members in a minute. All members of the Committee should be aware that Scottish health is a key matter in relation to the amendments and to the wider political debate.<br><br>
Nine English Ministries have already been devolved into the Scottish Office; devolution has already taken place in an administrative sense. The problem is that they cannot operate properly within that framework—they certainly cannot operate democratically within that framework.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman referred to the wider political debate. There will be an early opportunity on the Floor of the House for a wider political debate. I hope that all interventions and replies will be confined to the terms of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Devlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman complained about the fact that no Scottish Health Minister was available to attend the Committee. Under his proposals, of course, there would be no Scottish Health Minister in the House of Commons, and the hon. Gentleman, as a Scottish Member of Parliament, could not question that Minister anyway. If a Scottish Member serving in the United Kingdom Parliament was worried about health in Scotland, he or she would not be able to ask a question in the House because, under the hon. Gentleman's proposals, there would be no Minister with the relevant responsibilities. Is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin) heard what I said. I advise the hon. Member for Leith not to respond to that intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since I cannot reply to that point, I shall immediately give way again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman discussed cross-border practices. Under his preferred system of Government, would that part of a practice that is in Scotland be governed by rules that were set by a Scottish Assembly and would that part of a practice that is in England be governed by a different set of rules, which were set in England? Would not that lead to total confusion and mayhem among GPs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is highly relevant to the amendment—it is a good description of the current situation. I suspect that that is why you, Sir Alan, kindly let me digress.<br><br>
I hope that I have explained the background to the amendments. The hon. Gentleman—an English Member—failed to understand the principal point that we already have separate health systems in Scotland and in England. That is precisely the point that I made earlier, and the reason behind the probing amendments.<br><br>
There have been separate arrangements for Scotland and for England since the formation of the NHS. For example, the local medical committee that represents GPs—there is such a body in Scotland—is not recognised by the Scottish Act although it is recognised by the English National Health Service Act 1946. That is relevant to our debate because the Bill will require pilot projects in England but not those in Scotland to consult the local medical committee. The local medical committee does not have that legislative status in Scotland.<br><br>
That is an important problem with regard to cross-border pilots. The consultation arrangements in Scotland and in England are different. The Scottish Act gives legislative recognition to an area medical committee, which includes consultants and GPs, but that committee has a different remit and the terms and conditions of service are not relevant.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0478">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
Committee members may feel that those are arcane matters. However, they have been raised by GPs in Scotland—and the rest of the United Kingdom—who are worried about the practical implications of pilot schemes. I have given an example of one discrepancy, but there are several others. With regard to a cross-border pilot scheme, for example, which Secretary of State will approve the application and which health authority or board will process it? That is a straightforward question.<br><br>
We now have more uniformity in the complaints system as a result of changes made last April. Complaints in Scotland and England go first to local resolution and then possibly to independent review. As the two countries have different ombudsmen, would a patient go to the ombudsman in England or would Scottish arrangements apply?<br><br>
Another difference raised with me by the medical profession concerns dispensing arrangements which, under pilot schemes, will remain in part II of either—I am not sure which—the National Health Service Act 1977 or the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978. Will dispensing be operated according to Scottish or English legislation which are, of course, different? GPs in England must apply to health authorities for permission to dispense; Scottish health boards require practitioners to dispense.<br><br>
There are other differences. Stock orders—for example, orders for penicillin or bandages—are free in Scotland and GPs get a reduction in their capitation fee. Doctors in England, however, can obtain fees for some items that are dispensed. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West mentioned that arrangement in relation to flu vaccinations, for which GPs in Scotland do not get paid. I have reiterated doctors' concerns about cross-border pilot schemes. Which arrangements will operate—Scottish arrangements or English arrangements?<br><br>
Another question is how will associate schemes, inducement schemes or the out-of-hours development fund be organised in cross-border schemes? There are, again, big differences between Scotland and England. I do not think that associate schemes and inducement schemes exist in England, and the rules that operate the allocation of funding for out-of-hours development in Scotland are separate from those in England. What arrangements will apply in cross-border pilots?<br><br>
Another area of concern involves GP training. will it be organised under the Scottish or the English system? In Scotland, it is organised by the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education. I am not sure what body organises it in England but it certainly does not come under the remit of that council. Finally, will Scottish or English courts have jurisdiction when, for example, patients who are suing the health authority or board seek judicial review?<br><br>
Those questions have been raised by the medical profession. They are not details. They are to do with the practical implementation of cross-border pilot schemes which are made feasible by legislation. It is right that the Government should address those
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
questions and say what arrangements they have in place to deal with them. As I said earlier, I am not presenting the problems in a negative or carping spirit. I am happy to have cross-border pilots because I believe fully in the future of the United Kingdom, which is why we are introducing constitutional proposals to strengthen the UK and preserve its unity. I am totally in favour of partnership and new forms partnership between Scotland and England but we need to work out details of how the new arrangements will apply. Since the health service began there have been significant differences in legislation and in the practical implementation of the health service in Scotland and England.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to give a Welsh view to supplement the Scottish dimension given by my hon. Friend the Member for Leith in his speech on what is a probing amendment. I heard, listened and digested your strictures, Sir Alan, that we must not stray into the pastures of 1,000 years of British history, as the Prime Minister put it in the notorious gaff in his speech in Wales last Friday. We must confine ourselves to the issue of cross-border pilot schemes.<br><br>
Until the publication of the Bill, I thought that a cross-border pilot scheme was the scheme by which the Minister for Health and the Minister responsible for Sport were transferred from Scottish to English Conservative seats because they could not win seats in Scotland. But now we have a new meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Robathan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blaby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's comment. I believe that the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West—the hon. Member who represents the constituency in which the Rosyth shipyard is located—was raised in England? She is English, but she sits for a Scottish constituency. Is that a good example?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Lady was ever rejected by the English electorate as the Minister for Health was rejected by the Scottish electorate. I have always thought that "cross-border pilot scheme" was a much better phrase to apply to the Minister for Health than "MacRetread", which is the other popular description that I have heard.<br><br>
How is Wales affected by the distinction between the administrative and legislative arrangements that is causing the problems that led the medical profession in Scotland to persuade us to table the probing amendments? About half of the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Leith concerning Scottish-English cross-border pilot schemes also apply to Welsh-English cross-border pilot schemes. The court system is the same, so judicial review would not pose a problem, but approval would pose a problem. A cross-border scheme involving a primary healthcare set-up close to the Welsh-English border would give rise to difficulty as to whether it should be approved by the Secretary of State for Wales or the Secretary of State for Health.<br><br>

12.30 pm<br><br>
The distinction between the administrative arrangements and any back-up arrangements—for example, the ombudsman and judicial review—is much easier in the case of Wales and England than with England and Scotland. What makes the Welsh problem as great as the Scottish-English problem is that there is a much larger population close to the Welsh-English border, and that border is much longer than the English-Scottish border. It is common for GPs and other primary healthcare professionals near the border to have patients on both sides. The question of which Secretary of State will be responsible for giving approval will arise more frequently on the Welsh-English border than on the Scottish-English border, because of the large population along the Welsh-English border all the way from the Dee estuary to Chepstow, compared with the sparse population along the shorter Scottish-English border.<br><br>
There was a famous case about a year ago in Presteigne, which is on the English border. The GP had lost his practice allowance because a large proportion of his patients were conscientious objectors to vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus and so on. It was a difficult problem; many of his patients live on the English side of the border, but his allowance was eventually denied him by the Secretary of State for Wales because he did not reach the target, as a result of conscientious objector parents who did not want their children to be vaccinated. That was a classic case of the administrative problems that arise.<br><br>
We do not want to discourage cross-border pilot experiments, but we want to be clear about how the Government will solve the problem of which Secretary of State will take the lead in approving and administering them, in making arrangements for funding and in correcting the funding when there are patients across the border from the lead Department. The Government must address that major issue.<br><br>
I have referred to dispensing. I hope that the Minister will respond to the problem of finding the right method for improving dispensing arrangements and contracting arrangements for influenza vaccine. Arrangements may already exist from which we can learn. The difference between the arrangements involving the Secretary of State for Wales and the Secretary of State for Health in England and those concerning the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State for Health in England and Wales provide the thrust for the Bill. In Scotland a pilot may already be covered by different legislation. The Scots may wish to learn what is already going on in England and Wales where the different arrangements may mean that such pilots already exist. For example, the distinction between family health service authorities and health authorities was abolished in England and Wales but that distinction never existed in Scotland in the first place. It could be argued that Scotland acted as a pilot for what happened in England and Wales as a result of the Health Authorities Act 1995. The Minister for Health and I last met in the Committee stage of that Act.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
Different constituent parts of the UK can sometimes learn from each other: sometimes they struggle to reinvent the wheel when it has already been invented in a part of the UK with a slightly different legislative or administrative arrangement. Is communication between England and the Celtic fringe countries sufficiently good to enable us to appreciate that a pilot experiment to prove a theory is unnecessary because that theory has already been proven one way or another in a different part of the UK?<br><br>
We want to encourage pilot arrangements but we need to be clear that financing arrangements will not cause distortions—in the payment system if not in the market—by favouring one area over another because those arrangements are difficult to work out. We do not want it to be thought that if patients come from both sides of the border, the English health budget might be depleted because the health centre is on the Welsh side of the border. I do not know whether the Government have thought the matter through but we know that such arrangements have caused major problems. We need to be certain that the Government have the administrative arrangements sorted out, otherwise there are bound to be problems.<br><br>
As an example, I cite the current difficulties with dispensing arrangements for the small practice allowance for community pharmacies. I hope that the Minister is conscious of those difficulties. We know that, since that allowance was introduced, one health authority often feels that it is being cheated by a neighbouring health authority. A pharmacy may be in danger of having insufficient patients to meet the small practice allowance criteria. A pharmacy in the same chain in an adjoining health authority—it could be over the border—could transfer prescriptions so that they are processed in the pharmacy that is in danger of not achieving the requirements for the small practice allowance. Since that allowance was introduced, that abuse by chains of pharmacies has been happening throughout the country and represents a serious element of cheating. I know of a major on-going investigation in the Bro Tâf health authority, which covers my area in Cardiff. That problem is nationwide and so that investigation should be replicated throughout the country.<br><br>
Cross-border transfers occur because of financial inducements to cheat the NHS. They cause distortions between different health authorities, which are given money to cover the services for their population. Unfortunately, that population cannot be insulated from the semi-fraudulent activities of some pharmacy companies that want to ensure that all their pharmacies get the small practice allowance. That means that one health authority will be short of money and the other will have too much because the first health authority has to pay the pharmacy costs of the population of the second. If that happens already with a relatively simple system—all the prescriptions remain in storage for about 10 years in England, Wales and Scotland and each pharmacy keeps its own prescriptions with pilot schemes, where trying things differently is almost welcomed, problems will arise

unless the Government have worked everything out thoroughly. I hope that, in his response the Minister will cover all those points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is usually with trepidation that, as an English Member of Parliament, I rise to contribute to a debate that concerns Scottish and Welsh affairs. In this debate, however, it is right for an English Member to say a few words because, by definition, a cross-border arrangement is one that affects Scotland and England or Wales and England.<br><br>
The value of the probing amendment, apart from the specifics mentioned by my hon. Friends, is that it makes us ask how large, in terms of geographical spread, the Government intend that the pilot projects could be. I would welcome an answer from the Minister: what is the maximum geographical size that a Secretary of State in England, Scotland or Wales would approve for a pilot scheme?<br><br>
We tend to think of primary care as a local issue because that is how it is organised at present, but it would, presumably, be possible for a corporation to set up a nationwide primary care scheme, which provided services in many centres. At the moment, some practices have centres in several locations within a relatively small area, but under the terms of the Bill, it seems to be possible—although it might not be the Government's intention—to have a UK-wide primary care service. That would not be likely for general practice, but it could be for certain specialist services.<br><br>
For instance, before I became a Member of Parliament, I did some work for South Tyneside health authority, as it then was, in connection with services for drug misusers. One of the organisations that I visited was a voluntary body called Phoenix house, a rehabilitation centre for drug misusers. Many of the clients came from Edinburgh. It is conceivable that a proposal might be received for a pilot project to provide a specialist service which could have centres in a number of places in the UK and draw patients from across the country.<br><br>
On geographical spread, is it the Government's intention that the provisions be used solely to provide services that are common between Penrith and Gretna, for example, or could Dr. Finlay come to Falmouth? Under the Bill's present provisions, the Government could be introducing a Scottish-based flying doctor service for the south coast. If that is not the Government's intention, they probably need to change the Bill.<br><br>
My final point might guide our understanding of the issues. The one bit of the health service that I can think of which commonly crosses the borders between Scotland and England and between Wales and England is the ambulance service. My hon. Friend the Member for Leith made a point about differences in the administrative arrangements, the law and the legal systems of Scotland and Wales, which, I presume, must have reared its head in relation to ambulance journeys. If there is a complaint, to whom is it made—under which system does one complain? If a problem occurs in Luton when a person is being transferred by ambulance from Edinburgh to London, is that covered by English or Scottish health service legislation? If
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
people want to deal with the ombudsman, do they use the English or the Scottish arrangement? There must be precedents which would help us understand how such problems could be resolved. That is an important issue, not a nit-picking Opposition debate.<br><br>
One of the big problems in the national health service is the escalating cost of litigation. I went recently to talk to the Medical Defence Union whose representatives complained about the year-on-year increase in the cost of medical protection cover for doctors as people become more litigious. Every pound spent in the courts or by doctors on medical protection cover is a pound that is no longer available for patient care. It would be regrettable if, by permitting cross-border pilots, the Government created a new industry or weight of caseloads for medical lawyers. It would be a great shame if further NHS money was spent in the courts, rather than in the consulting rooms. I hope that the Government will assure the Comittee that the Bill's proposals will not lead to that.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always interested to hear the hon. Member for York when he extends occasionally into the less likely possibilities that could flow from legislation. He gave some interesting proposals this morning, but, for several practical reasons, I suggest that they are rather unlikely. I remind him that, as we progress through the Bill, we shall discuss several clauses—in particular, clause 3—when, no doubt, we shall debate what will be the criteria for pilot schemes.<br><br>
In an earlier debate I mentioned that work is already going ahead on what criteria will apply to pilot schemes that may qualify. There must be a statutory reserve power contained in the legislation to rule out something that will be ridiculous or against patients' interests.<br><br>
I also remind the hon. Gentleman that pilots will not be driven by either the Secretary of State or the Minister for Health. They will be driven by those who are involved in the delivery of a primary healthcare service. The hon. Gentleman may think it possible that a consensus would be reached among a whole range of professionals, spread from Land's End to John O'Groats, to provide a specific monopoly service of primary care—"UK Primary Care Inc." I can tell the hon. Gentleman that, in my experience of those who provide primary health care services throughout the United Kingdom, a proposal of such an establishment of consensus would be unlikely. I use the word "unlikely" in a well-founded sense. Perhaps some of the extreme examples that the hon. Gentleman cited would simply fall at the first practical hurdle.<br><br>
As has been pointed out, when we are putting in place a piece of enabling legislation it is important to ensure that we seek neither to allow what will be unreasonable and foolish, nor to place in primary legislation something that is unduly restrictive and will hamper development of service, service that this legislation is designed to encourage. I agree that there must be fail-safe points in the legislation to prevent anything occurring that will not be in the interest of patient care or in the interest of the wider NHS.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister deals kindly with my greater extravagances. However, he will remember that I told the Committee that I did not, for one moment, suppose that primary care GP services would be provided on a UK-wide basis. I suggested that more specialist services would have a much wider geographical spread. For example, I cited the services for drug misusers, which is the nearest equivalent of a supra-regional specialty for community care or primary care services. Another example would be care services for travellers, which might want to have a wide geographical spread. Will the Minister try to address the question whether there is any limit that the Government would accept on the geographical spread, in which certain services—most likely, specialist services—could operate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to rule out or rule in any innovatory scheme that may come before the Secretary of State for consideration. The hon. Gentleman illustrates a possibility, but any practical version of that possibility would require the widespread geographical support of all the professionals involved in delivering the care.<br><br>
However, in the spirit of the Bill, I do not want to suggest that there would be any specific geographical limitations. That would be foolish: if any geographical limit were set in primary legislation the hon. Gentleman would be on his feet to suggest that there was a place across a boundary where it would make sense to continue a service. Enshrining such a limitation in the Bill would not, therefore, make much sense.<br><br>
I turn to the points raised by the hon. Members for Cardiff, West and for Leith about the principal point of this aspect of the Bill. The hon. Gentlemen asked many questions of detail about what is to happen regarding cross-border arrangements. Clearly, three different systems are to be maintained. How are the differences between those systems to be reconciled? Will they be reconciled by this provision in the Bill or will they be reconciled in the development of the pilot schemes?<br><br>
The Bill makes it clear that the management of a pilot scheme will be delegated once the scheme is established and the interests have been reconciled but before it is put to the Secretary of State for Scotland or, if it is a Scottish-English cross-border pilot, to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health. When all the problems described by the Opposition have been reconciled, it is the management of the scheme that will be delegated.<br><br>
That is sensible. In practice, the service provider will have to deal with only one authority. The pilot schemes for either side of the border can therefore be run in an integrated way.<br><br>
It may be helpful to deal with the matters that have been raised by making the principle absolutely clear. At present, when a GP practice straddles the border, patients registered with that practice live on either side of the border. Scottish patients are seen under Scottish rules, and English patients are seen under English
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
rules. That will remain the case under the pilot schemes. The Bill merely deals with the management of such schemes once they are in place.<br><br>
We want to encourage general practitioners, or others who can provide cross-border services, to take part in piloting new arrangements. I can think of many places in which such arrangements would make logical sense. I know very well the small town of Coldstream, for example. That town is divided by a river, so that one side of the community is in England and the other is in Scotland. In such circumstances, it is important for patients that there is a coherent system. For those providing the scheme, it is important that there is one point of reference when it comes to management. They should not be split two ways. The Bill will allow a single authority to be responsible for the administration of the arrangements for the scheme.<br><br>
How will the power work in practice? The relevant health authority and health board would each put forward proposals for pilot schemes to their respective Secretaries of State. The management of the authority's scheme, once implemented, could then be delegated by the authority to the board, or by the board to the authority. In practice, therefore, the provider will have to deal with only one body.<br><br>
There are obvious benefits in the lead authority normally being the one in whose area the majority of patients covered by the pilot scheme reside, but there may be other reasons why that should not be so. We do not need to make the Bill prescriptive so that it dictates the absolute parameters. Service providers will have a common sense knowledge of who would be most competent to manage a scheme once it had been approved.<br><br>
The proposal is not quite complicated as it might sound in theory; it is perhaps one of those areas in which practice has developed over time and is simpler than the theory. Indeed, numerous policy issues are already before both Secretaries of State. They must be thoroughly discussed before they even reach this stage. Approval will be the result of an iterative process aimed at ensuring that all parties are satisfied. I return to one of the fundamental points in the Bill, which we shall come across frequently in Committee: the voluntary principle that is enshrined in the Bill means that for a scheme to come forward it must be based on a consensus.<br><br>
Although there are different legal systems in England and in Scotland, national health service legislation is substantially the same. There may be differences in the way that the Scottish and English parts of a cross-border pilot might operate. Detailed issues, such as those raised by hon. Members representing Scottish and Welsh constituencies, will have to be resolved at that point.<br><br>
Piloting the new arrangements will provide the opportunity to test exactly how the different systems might combine in practice. Setting out the detailed arrangements in contracts will also provide clarity. I listened with interest to the points about practical differences when trying to set up a more seamless service in the context of a cross-border pilot. It may be that during discussions—about contracts, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0482">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
evaluation of pilots, permanent arrangments and the contracts flowing from them—many of the difficulties mentioned by Opposition Members will be reconciled.<br><br>
I shall deal with two further points that were mentioned specifically—dispensing and conflict of laws. The powers to arrange for dispensing for doctors in Scotland are the equivalent of those in England. However, as the Committee knows, the powers are applied differently. In Scotland, doctors dispense only when required to do so by a health board to patients who can prove serious difficulty in obtaining medicines from a pharmacy.<br><br>
A handful of practices on either side of the border, where the GPs in question are on both medical lists, currently provide a dispensing service to patients resident across the border. There is a good example of what might theoretically be looked upon as a stumbling block being reconciled already: in such circumstances, arrangements are made with the English health authority and the Scottish health board and claims, which are calculated on the same basis, are made to the Prescription Pricing Authority or its Scottish equivalent as appropriate.<br><br>
While we would need to maintain the difference in approach in granting dispensing doctor rights—it is not the intention of the Bill to go into matters of that sort—that would not in itself hinder the effective operation of a cross-border pilot. That is a good example of how problems that, on the face of it, appear to be severe are being resolved in practice.<br><br>
I also want to deal with the question of complaints and discipiline, for people may think that there will be difficulty in reconciling an approach. There are no material differences in the systems for England and for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
Scotland. Both countries have followed the recommendations of the Wilson report on complaints and their discipline procedures also correspond.<br><br>
Finally, in conflict of law disputes, if the legal contracts—those that specify which jurisdiction will apply—were not specified, the courts with jurisdiction would be either those of the place of habitual residence of the defendant of those of the place where the contractual obligation is to be performed. I hope that the Committee is satisfied on those points and that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has taken us to the wire because he is frightened that I will again object on those issues. He acknowledged the problems, but did not tell us in detail how they will be resolved. Concerns were raised not only by British Medical Association representatives in Scotland, but by BMA nationally. The debate has been useful because Conservative Members have had to remember that we have not been in a unitary state for 1,000 years—only the Prime Minister is that ignorant—and do not have a full unitary state currently. We have separate arrangements and they must be addressed in the Bill.<br><br>
I thank the Minister for taking that on board and for piloting the cross-border movement of defeated Conservatives, and hope that many of his colleagues will follow him after the general election.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave, to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
