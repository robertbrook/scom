Draft Health and Safety (Repeals and Revocations) Regulations 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Sir Paul Beresford)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Health and Safety (Repeals and Revocations) Regulations 1996.</p></blockquote>
On 23 October, I laid before Parliament proposals for the Health and Safety (Repeals and Revocations) Regulations 1996. The regulations are being made under section 37 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 which allows the removal, without replacement, of certain existing health and safety statutory provisions that have been shown to be outdated and to have no practical effect. The latest proposals remove 16 pieces of redundant legislation relating specifically to textile and agricultural workplaces.<br><br>
I come first to the textile provisions, some of which have reached their 90th birthday and are long overdue for retirement, if not burial. They cover three subjects—artificial humidification, kiers and cotton shuttles. In the early part of the century, textile workers were exposed to unpleasant and sometimes dangerous working conditions caused by a combination of high temperatures and humidity. The steam injection systems used to humidify workrooms were controlled by hand. Regular thermometer and hygrometer readings acted as a check that humidification levels were being properly controlled, and the law required these readings to be taken in a prescribed manner at specified times during the working shifts. Steam is no longer used as a means of humidification and modern monitoring and control systems are automated. The related legislation is simply redundant.<br><br>
I shall explain what a kier is for those who, like me until recently, were unaware that it is a big vat used for boiling textiles. It incorporates a system that allows water to percolate through the textiles. The regulations apply to kiers in print works, bleaching and dyeing works, or works where cotton or cotton waste is bleached. They address the risks from scalding by hot liquid or steam and lay down systems of work for routine entry to kiers for operational and maintenance purposes. Few, if any, kiers are still in use. Even if some still survive, the specific requirements set out in the regulations are now superseded by modern across-the-board health and safety legislation.<br><br>
The regulations on cotton shuttles, prohibit the use of shuttles that are threaded by mouth suction in cotton cloth factories, because of the risk of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
contracting a serious disease such as tuberculosis. Fortunately, technological changes in the industry mean that the regulations are obsolete.<br><br>
The agricultural provisions cover four subjects—field machinery, in which I include the provisions on threshers and stationary balers, ladders, workplaces, and poisonous substances.<br><br>
The regulations on field machinery cover the sale and hire of machines as well as their use. From 1 January 1997, they will be duplicated by the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1992 and the Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 1992. They are simply not needed.<br><br>
Regulations on ladders place an obligation on agricultural employers to ensure that ladders provided for use by their employees are properly constructed and used in a safe manner. The construction and use of ladders in all sectors of business is now covered by modern across-the-board legislation and manufacturing standards.<br><br>
Similarly, the requirements in the regulations covering the safety of agriculture workplaces are duplicated by those elsewhere, particularly those in the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992. The more modern regulations deal with the working environment in all workplaces, including ventilation, temperature, cleanliness, safe movement around the workplace, and falls from a height. They also deal with welfare issues such as access to washing facilities and sanitary conveniences.<br><br>
Much of the Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) Act 1952 has already been repealed. Those sections which remain refer to the taking of samples of substances to which the Act applies, either because they are listed in the Act or in orders made under it. The sampling procedures are no longer used by health and safety inspectors who have powers to take samples under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 instead.<br><br>
The Health and Safety Commission has consulted widely with industry on the proposals. The responses received demonstrated that there was no objection from those affected, by which I mean organisations representing employers and employees, to the proposals, which I therefore commend to the Committeee.</span></p>
<p>4.35 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen <span class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Sir Robert. I have no intention of keeping you from your date with the England women's cricket captain. It is an important engagement that none of us wish you to miss. However, today is significant for another reason—the working time directive judgment was delivered earlier. That is an important milestone for health and safety.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Hamilton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tatton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Millstone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can make a speech later—I am sure that it will be enlightening about the splits in the Conservative party on Europe. It is a shame that the directive has been treated in such a way.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0024">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
The Opposition believe that it is important, but I shall strain your patience, Sir Robert, if I continue with that theme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has had his fun at the Government's expense. The order is narrow, and relates to textiles and agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is so narrow that I have only several pages of comments to make. I shall try to speed through them.<br><br>
The Opposition support the removal of unnecessary regulation. We agree with the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress that most of the regulations with which the order deals are no longer needed. However, the order reveals the outgoing Government's priorities—headlong deregulation of health and safety legislation. The adverse effects of the Government's actions and the potential impact of the regulations on blue-collar and white-collar workers throughout the country should be considered.<br><br>
I am pleased that I am joined by my hon. Friends the Members for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham), for Burnley (Mr. Pike) and for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping), and by the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler), who bring to our proceedings a measure of expertise in the mining industry, the Factories Acts, textiles and agriculture. All those matters are covered by the repeals and revocations regulations. Doubtless, hon. Members will make particular points about specific revocations. However, parliamentary time would have been better spent in discussing ways in which relevant regulations could be better enforced, rather than in getting rid of meaningless regulations, many of which have fallen into disuse.<br><br>
My recent parliamentary questions to the Minister revealed the seriousness of the current situation. Inspections carried out by the Health and Safety Executive have fallen by 30 per cent. since 1991. There are now 106 fewer inspectors than there were two years ago, so it is little wonder that there are not enough people to enforce the regulations. The Health and Safety Executive has to pull inspectors out of policy work to make up the shortfall in inspections. Many inspectors who work on policy spend their time trawling back through Acts from the 1920s and earlier to sate the Government's desire to clock up revocations and repeals so that they can proclaim that they are deregulating. I would prefer those inspectors to spend their time enforcing health and safety regulations in the workplace, not trawling through ancient statutes.<br><br>
The number of enforcement notices issued by the Health and Safety Executive's field operations directorate is the lowest for 10 years. This year, there was a reduction of 20 per cent. on last year. Enforcement notices issued by local authority inspectors have almost halved in the past two years.<br><br>
Many of the regulations that we are considering affect the agricultural industry, which has serious health and safety problems. Last year, the Health and Safety Executive cut agricultural inspectors from 169
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
to 75, convictions have fallen to their lowest in more than five years, yet deaths in the sector have increased by more than one third. Inspectors previously dedicated exclusively to policing agriculture now also cover other industries including woodworking, construction and so on. So not only are there fewer of them but agriculture is receiving less targeted assistance from health and safety inspectors, while half a dozen or so statutory instruments or orders relating to agriculture are being revoked. Rather than use parliamentary time phasing out some of these irrelevant regulations, perhaps the Minister will explain how he can sanction reducing the number of health and safety inspectors in agriculture while the number of accidents in agricultural work is so high. Quite literally, the cuts presided over by the Minister can damage people's health.<br><br>
My hon. Friends will no doubt point out that there are also problems with textile industry regulations on account of some proposed repeals. The textile industry is similarly concerned that the number of inspectors is inadequate for visiting all the small textile companies that need health and safety advice and guidance. This matter was raised by the textile industry advisory committee only this morning at a meeting with the Health and Safety Commission. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to the outcome of that meeting, especially on the question of the inadequate number of inspectors.<br><br>
In that sense, we should be pleased that the inspectors have fewer irrelevant regulations to enforce. Equally, I wonder whether some inspectors are now being asked to trawl back through such things as the Flax and Tow Spinning and Weaving Regulations 1906 to discover whether more brownie points could be gained by putting repeals and revocations before Ministers. That is not their job; their job is to be out there protecting the rights and welfare of those who work in the textile industry.<br><br>
A number of the repeals cover health-related issues: the number of doctor and nurse specialists in occupational health who are employed by the HSE is at an all-time low, with morale among them extremely poor. The Government must address this if they wish to make the HSE's Good Health is Good Business campaign as effective as we wish. Doctors and nurses have a major representational role in the industry and should be better supported.<br><br>
The repeals are fine; the easy points have been scored. I should like the Minister to comment on whether the Government will begin repealing measures that are quite important in regulating health and safety provision at work. In particular, will he comment on the proposed removal of the Anthrax Prevention Order 1922, which employers and employees want to keep in place against the threat to health from imported fleeces. How does the Minister propose protecting British workers from dangerous imported raw materials such as fleeces? The Committee on Substances Hazardous to Health is not the answer, as both the Confederation of British Industries and the Trades Union Congress agree—first, because anthrax is not a constant condition and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0025">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
therefore could not be assessed under COSHH; secondly there is no clear definition of which materials contain anthrax and, thirdly, because the control of anthrax is more about disinfection than elimination, and cannot be dealt with by COSHH.<br><br>
What does the Minister propose to do about the anthrax order? I see, Sir Robert, that he is trying to prompt you, but I know that you are at least as capable of doing your job as he is his. I hope that he will put a few words on the record today.<br><br>
A number of agriculture statutory instruments are listed in the regulations. Further major deregulation, including the repeal of various Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) Orders, is proposed. Other major deregulation initiatives are planned for pesticides and pesticide-related issues.<br><br>
Pesticides are still a major problem. I need only mention organophosphates, sheep dips and Gulf war disease to highlight this fact. The 1995–96 HSE pesticides incident report, published this month, shows that 169 incidents were investigated, 82 of which alleged ill health, but that only 12 prosecutions, with an average fine of only £533, were brought. That is pathetic in any language, and no deterrent to anyone, let alone a large company or organisation misusing pesticides in the UK in the late 1990s. I know that the Minister, having come to Committee to revoke four relevant orders, will be conversant with issues relating to agricultural poisonous substances. Given the public's concern about pesticides, I hope that we shall be told exactly what is planned with respect to pesticides.<br><br>
Is not it true that the current and proposed cotton, hemp, flax and jute dust standards do not protect the work force from crippling lung disease, despite the fact that conditions associated with those textiles were among the first ever occupational lung diseases recognised by British occupational health doctors as arising from our then massive cotton industry more than 100 years ago? In these Committee Rooms, Members of Parliament on both sides of the House raised questions about the health of workers in the industries concerned and fought long campaigns. Some of the items dating from that time have an almost comic feel to them, but they were life-saving regulations at the time. Will the Minister reassure the Committee that the work force in the industries that I have mentioned—admittedly a far smaller work force than in those halcyon days—will be protected from crippling lung disease?<br><br>
We welcome the repeal of outdated law, but both the CBI and the TUC have expressed reservations about whether the process is worth continuing, given the effort that is needed to repeal regulations that are, for the most part, inapplicable anyway. If the Minister is serious about the amendment of health and safety law, then where, we should ask, is his response to the Law Commission's report on corporate killing? By all means let us amend the law in those respects to be dealt with by the measure that we are considering, but let us also consider amending the law on manslaughter. We
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
must ensure that that, for example, catches bad employers who send lorry drivers to their death in chronically badly maintained vehicles, or who put to sea unseaworthy boats, such as the Pescado—I know that you are familiar with that case from last year, Sir Robert. Another such case was the Marchioness disaster, in which visibility on a London dredger was very bad.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying from the draft regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, the draft regulations before us contain enough tidying up of the law for today, but a Minister who wanted to look further, and who cared about health and safety and had control of his Department, could find a substantial agenda for reform of the law in this sphere, including mining, agriculture, the textile industry, or the matter of corporate manslaughter to which I just alluded. There is enough work to keep a Minister busy for a whole Parliament.<br><br>
I am also concerned that, in replacing out-of-date regulations on hazardous substances, as parts of the regulations, at least, will do, the Minister may be allowing some standards to slip. Older laws required employers to comply with regulations as far as was practicable, yet now they need do so only where compliance is reasonably practicable. That is a subtle but important distinction. For a judgment to be made about whether compliance is reasonably practicable, an industry or work place must be assessed as high or low risk. Without regular preventive inspection programmes, that judgment cannot accurately be made. The Minister may want to tell the Committee whether he is satisfied with the definition of "reasonably practicable" and whether he plans to include preventive inspections so that assessments may be properly made.<br><br>
Today is significant in the history of health and safety because of the working time directive. The draft regulations may appear to be relatively small beer in the light of that immense development, but there are lessons to be learnt. We passed regulations many years ago to safeguard the health, environment and safety of people at work. We should be careful that, in spending time trawling through the old statute books to clock up some points by making the Deputy Prime Minister a happier man, we do not divert resources from the vital task of keeping people at work healthily and safely.</span></p>
<p>4.50 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lancaster)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I look around the serried ranks of the Opposition and my own Benches, I suspect that I am probably the only Committee member who has served on a stationary thresher and a stationary baler.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'> indicated dissent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, well, it was a different age altogether anyway. I can certainly assure the Committee that thousands of statutory instruments could not stop one looking like a chimney sweep in 45 minutes flat.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0026">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
Station balers have long since gone, although there are a few in museums. I welcome the fact that the Government have gone away from out-of-date and obsolete regulations and have concentrated on the safety standards of machinery, especially for children, so that they cannot now get drowned in corn and are safe on the farm. I have several grandchildren and I want to be absolutely certain that they are safe. It is commendable that these out-of-date regulations are being swept away and that we have an altogether more modern approach to the farms that, in my day, were delightful but rather dangerous and certainly mucky.</span></p>
<p>4.51 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Tyler <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Cornwall)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not expect to find myself in agreement with the hon. Member for Lancaster (Dame E. Kellett-Bowman) but she is right to say that we need to modernise our legislative framework and get away from the obsolete regulations that dealt with the machinery of yesteryear.<br><br>
Some of the regulations that we are discussing today, however are still incredibly relevant. We must be satisfied that if they are redundant, they are replaced with something better. That is the critical issue before us, and it applies particularly to poisonous substances in agriculture, which is a special interest of mine.<br><br>
I do not take the view that old age necessarily implies redundancy. I heard the Minister say that some of these regulations are reaching their 90th birthday. My mother, who as you know, Sir Robert, is a good Cornish woman of good Cornish stock, will reach her 95th birthday this week. If I go to her birthday party next weekend and tell her that the Minister said that she is redundant simply because she is over 90, I shall get a few choice words.<br><br>
A number of the provisions before us are nothing like 90 years old. The Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) Act 1952, for example, has already been amended by the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. The Minister must prove that even the amended, modernised form, which is young by any standards, is nevertheless redundant. In this Room, or in one somewhere down this Corridor, I was a member of the Committee that debated that health and safety legislation in 1974. I do not think that any other Member here was able to attend then. Indeed, you, Sir Robert, were unable to attend because I had just replaced you in your seat, although you were subsequently to replace me again; all's fair in love and war.<br><br>
My point is that that legislation was revisited comparatively recently. The crucial issues before us, as the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) rightly said, are whether the regulations are relevant and adequately enforced and whether modernisation has given them strength and substance rather than weakening them. In this place, we should never be satisfied simply by removing one set of regulations if we cannot meet that test.<br><br>
In the case of the Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) Act 1952 and its various extension orders, I remain to be convinced on that point. I hope that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Minister can give a more convincing argument on that. To start with, it is extremely difficult to find out what the provisions of the extension orders are or were. I, my staff and the staffs of the Library and the Clerk's Department have been searching all afternoon for the Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) (Extension) Order 1966, which was SI 1966/645. Apparently it is not in the Library. I was brought up to think that if something did not exist in the Library, it did not exist at all. If by sleight of hand the Department of the Environment and the Minister have already disposed of that order, in the famous words of Private Eye, "We should be told".<br><br>
A number of other issues are extremely important. For example, the emphasis in the Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) Act 1952 on the powers of the inspector and on giving information to those who may need it is extremely relevant in the case of organophosphate pesticides. Because of your constituency interest in the issue, you, Sir Robert, know that I lead a small all-party group that is concerned with organophosphates. As a result of a major U-turn by the Ministry of Defence, we have established that those pesticides were used extensively in the Gulf by our service personnel without the proper protective clothing. I known that there is at least one victim of the so-called Gulf war syndrome in your constituency, Sir Robert, so I know that you have been involved in these issues.<br><br>
Organophosphates are a classic case. Do the replacement regulations, to which the Minister referred, adequately take account of the fact that a number of such pesticides are used in circumstances that the previous regulations never anticipated? The obvious example is that of our service men. Originally such pesticides were only expected to be used in agriculture—by agricultural employees or by self-employed farmers, notably in the sheep industry. I want a specific answer from the Minister. Do the new regulations, which we are implicity and tacitly accepting as more than adequately replacing the old ones, actually adequately cover cases in which pesticides originally approved for agricultural work are used in circumstances such as the Gulf war?<br><br>
As we all know, service personnel were sent to the Gulf and huge quantities of these poisonous substances were used in order—as it was hoped—to reduce or to prevent insect-carried disease. In practice, the pesticides were inadequately labelled and service personnel were given inadequate advice. They were specifically told not to wear protective clothing despite the fact that three or four years before in <i>MS17</i>—I am sure that the Minister has that publication before him because it is produced by the Health and Safety Executive—it was specifically stated that those pesticides were extremely dangerous chemicals and should never be used without careful preventive measures and the most elaborate protective clothing. The failure of control mechanisms in the Gulf raises important questions about the adequacy of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 and the extent to which it is replacing other legislation.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
It is true that the number of inspectors in agriculture has been drastically cut and that there has been an almost precise correlation in the number of convictions resulting from dangerous episodes. I fear that everyone involved in agriculture will regret that these revocations are likely to be accepted without an explicit statement from the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on what positive steps he has taken to improve a damaging situation.<br><br>
You, Sir Robert, have been much involved in the agriculture industry throughout your long career in the House, and you will acknowledge that this issue is of perennial concern to everyone involved in agriculture. Although the Minister serves in another Department, I would hope that he has been properly briefed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the extent to which the orders are adequate.<br><br>
The failure to disseminate information, which is one of the requirements of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, is a major worry. I have already referred to the fact that in 1987 a revised version of <i>MS17</i> was published, but it was never brought to the attention of people in agriculture or to the attention of general practitioners, consultants or any of the other people who might have offered advice. Perhaps most notably and blameworthy of all, the information never went a few doors down Whitehall and reached the Ministry of Defence. Had the information reached the MoD, I am sure that there would have been no question of such chemicals being used in the incredibly dangerous way that they were during the Gulf war.<br><br>
Significantly, the Royal British Legion has this afternoon brought forward important evidence that results from its investigation of the Gulf war syndrome and its connection with the pesticides to which I have referred. That inquiry was financed by the Royal British Legion and mounted in the United States. It has to be said that in the United States, the Government, the Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency have secured for the victims of such poisonous substances far more information and clarity than has been available here. They have also benefited because of the Access to Information Acts. When something has gone wrong, they have been provided with a much more adequate and speedy assessment of what went wrong, why, and possible compensation than has been available to British victims.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister can assure us that sweeping away some doubtlessly obsolete and redundant regulations will not leave a void but will result in an improvement in the protection that is given not only to specific groups of workers and service personnel but to all citizens. I hope that they may have more effective access to the information they need in order to know precisely what poisonous substances are being used.<br><br>
The group of orders are important. I hope that the Minister will show how important he considers their replacement and improvement by giving adequate answers to the questions that we have rasied.</span></p>

<p>5.1 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter L. Pike <span class='memberconstituency'>(Burnley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak briefly. I do so partly because I represent a constituency where even now more than 50 per cent of the people are employed in the manufacturing industry. Before I became a Member of Parliament, I worked in that industry so I know how important helath and safety legislation and protection are. I am continually worried about signs that those regulations are being eroded and that, if anything, we are beginning to turn the clock back on health and safety legislation. That is extremely worrying.<br><br>
Anyone visiting my constituency and looking at the health of my constituents would see that their problems were created by the lack of proper health and safety legislation over many years. The cotton and mining industries, which for many years dominated Burnley, no longer exist. Coal mining has completely ceased and the manufacture of textiles is particularly cotton weaving. But two of the orders deal with the cotton industry; several deal with textiles but two, which refer to the cotton shuttles, are of particular concern to me.<br><br>
In the 1950s, I can well remember when that method of sucking the cotton through the shuttle was banned. There was considerable opposition from a number of mills which resisited change despite all the obvious problems connected with shuttles. The more progressive mills had moved away from that method some time before but others were somewhat reluctant even then. If the ban had not been necessary it would not have been introduced. If there had been a willingness to deal with the problem without legislation such legislation would have been unnecessary.<br><br>
The other issue that concerns me is humidity, to which the Minister referred. Steam was introduced into cotton mills to ensure that the cotton did not snap during the weaving process. It was not for the benefit of the workers in the industry. Many of my constituents have bronchitis and emphysema partly because of the dust and partly because of the artificially induced humidity. I am still pursuing that issue because some of those people affected have still not had their health problems recognised. The Minister has not reassured me that there are no circumstances in which such problems could arise as a result of the removal of certain regulations. I give him one example. When I was leader of the council in Burnley before I became an Member of Parliament one cotton mill, Queen Street mill in Briercliffe, was still working. It was the last cotton mill to work with the traditional cotton looms, powered by a coal boiler. The steam process operated right the way through the manufacture, with the machinery and the shafts run off the central system. That mill was going to be closed down in the early 1980s as it was no longer competitive. It was the last example of a working mill of that type. The looms and other equipment were more than 100 years old and the mill looked exactly the same as it did then. It would have seemed familiar to anyone who worked there in 1890.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0028">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
The council acquired the mill to run as a working museum, which Prince Charles visited. At the moment it is closed to enable English Heritage, Lancashire county council and Burnley borough council to undertake work to upgrade it. It will be open again as a working mill museum next year.<br><br>
The people who work there will be producing cotton under the old system and I want to be sure that they have adequate protection against the humidity and that satisfactory safeguards exist, even though it is a museum. I want to be sure, too, that they will not suffer problems caused by shuttles that are threaded by mouth suction. Can the Minister assure me that in that mill and in others—they may be similar but there are no exact parallels—the workers will not have the same problems as those suffered by my mother, my grandmother and other ancestors who worked in the Burnley cotton mills?<br><br>
I want people to see what made Britain great. Cotton was one of the great industries at the forefront of the industrial revolution. That is one reason why the council acquired the museum. However, although we want people to see a viable mill producing cotton, there must be adequate protection for the workers.</span></p>
<p>5.7 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Clapham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief.<br><br>
The Minister is aware that there is no great support by business to deregulate health and safety regulations in industry. We do not want to keep redundant regulations, but we want to be assured that relatively recent regulations—those introduced since 1959—will be adequately dealt with elsewhere. I want the Minister to assure the Committee that none of the regulations that we are discussing include working time; it would be cynical if the regulations that we are being asked to repeal or revoke were covered elsewhere in provisions on the working time directive. That happened in the coal mining industry: the Coal Industry Act 1992 provided for the repeal of the 1908 Act, which regulated hours in the coal mining industry, to be replaced by the working time directive. To do likewise in respect of these regulations would be cynical and I hope that the Minister will assure us that that is not the case.<br><br>
Will the Minister give us a specific assurance that the Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) (Extension) Order 1960 is adequately covered in other legislation and that there will be no less rigour in ensuring that the conditions of people who work with poisonous substances are as safe as they were when the order was in force?</span></p>
<p>5.9 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In common with other members of the Committee, I have tried to procure copies of the relevant Acts and statutory instruments, but some appear to be unavailable to anyone in the House. I am not too alarmed about that because I think that today's order reinforces the move from a prescriptive and restrictive approach to health and safety to a much more dynamic approach that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
focuses on creating the safety culture and has employers and employees trying jointly to reduce and minimise the threat to health and safety. I hope that the Minister will confirm that that is his general approach.<br><br>
If the Minister wants to see a good example of that, he could visit Thoresby colliery, as I did yesterday in north Nottinghamshire. The whole approach, from the colliery through to the pit bottom and the coal face is about reinforcing safety. The whole atmosphere in that unit is one of working together. There is a culture of safety rather than one of the restrictive and prescriptive orders that we are discussing.<br><br>
It is important to take that approach and vital that resources are made available to back that positive approach. The opening paragraph of the order says that the Health and safety Commission has been consulted about the order. Just as a burden has been lifted from industry, so has a burden been lifted off the commission. I hope that resources can be made available for it to do vital positive work. I hope that, as a result of the order, extra resources can go, for example, to the coal industry. The Minister will know that there is a real need in that industry. The number of major industry incidents in the coal industry has doubled during the past 18 months.<br><br>
In general, I welcome the order, but seek reassurance that although the Minister is getting rid of restrictive and prescriptive legislation he will ensure that any resources saved by that will be used to back a positive and dynamic approach. It is clear to me that, even in a privatised coal industry, those resources are needed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend sits down, will he allow me to add to his great expertise and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone, who is chairman of all-party health and safety group? My hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood made a valuable point about the availability of documents. I do not want to labour that point, but perhaps the Minister could make it clear that such documentation would be available in future. My hon. Friend is absolutely right that we do not want to trawl through things that are more than 100 years old, but there may be one or two little niceties, as my colleague the hon. Member for North Cornwall has said, which might be spotted by members of the Committee. It would be helpful if those documents were available to us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will have heard my colleague's plea from the Front Bench.</span></p>
<p>5.14 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster has also seen some of that machinery. I thought that, having come from a land of mud huts and grass skirts, I might be the only one who had actually seen the stuff working. She is right; the machinery is horrendous and horrible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I enjoyed it.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0029">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, my hon. Friend was viewing it rather than working it.<br><br>
I am surprised that the hon. Member for North Cornwall is not satisfied. He must recognise, and I am sure that he will when he pauses to think about it, that the order has gone through extensive consultation. The Health and Safety Commission and the Health and Safety Executive have gone through it. Employees have gone through it. Employers have gone through it. The unions have looked at it. The Confederation of British Industry has looked at it. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has looked at it. All the experts have seen it. All of them have cleared it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tyler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I put a specific question to the Minister to illustrate my concern? The Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) (Extension) Order 1966, SI 1996/398, specifically relates to organophosphorus compounds. That order predates the major concerns that have existed not just in agriculture, but more recently in the Gulf war. We cannot be sure that the replacememts are more adequate to deal with this very dangerous compound than this obviously was.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. As he knows there are four orders, one dated 1952, one dated 1960, one dated 1965 and one dated 1966, covered by the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974, the Food and Environment Protection Order Act 1985 and the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the famous words from <i>Private Eye.</i> There is another famous <i>Private Eye</i> saying which relates to a banana and I think that the protestation probably qualifies.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Burnley made an interesting point about a historic factory which is worth visiting. The safety aspect is covered by the Provisions and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1992 and the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1994. I am horrified to learn that as late as the 1950s that method of loading the looms or threading the needles was still being used. It is quite appalling to think of that nowadays.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone asked whether the working time directive would be dealt with by sleight of hand. There is no question of that. I think that I covered his point about agriculture when I rattled through the list of substitute measures.<br><br>
I often find, perhaps to the embarrassment of the hon. Member for Sherwood, that there is considerable agreement between us. He is right about the safety
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
culture attitude and the ethos change in the industry. He mentioned Thoresby colliery. I am not positive but I do not think that there was a single notifiable accident there last year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is mistaken. There have been two fatal accidents at Thoresby colliery in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected, although I was talking about the past 12 months. That is the approach that we are moving forward on and it has been completely successful. That is in complete contrast with the approach of the hon. Member for Nottingham, North who wants more regulation. The hon. Gentleman has an attitude problem. He wants heavy-handed regulation and prosecutions, and he judges success by the number of people dragged into court. A number of judges in the past rated their success by the number of bodies on hanging trees.<br><br>
What we are looking for, and what we are succeeding in achieving is a dramatic change in the numbers of accidents and fatalities. Britain's record is second to none in Europe. We are moving forward along the lines on which the hon. Member for Sherwood and I agree. I commend the regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has missed out a number of points. I do not know whether it is worth going over them again or whether he would prefer to reply to them in writing. If he gives me that assurance I shall not repeat them. There was one specific point on which he may be able to help: will he make the measures that we are repealing available so that hon. Members can study them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be prompt. I shall certainly look into that. I was not aware that they are not easily available. The hon. Gentleman asked about anthrax. We have been in consultation, have withdrawn that measure and are looking at it again. Pesticides, sheep dips and organophosphates are covered by the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986 but I am aware of the concern about this having used them myself.</span></p>
