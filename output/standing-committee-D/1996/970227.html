	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Draft Farm Woodland (Amendment) Scheme 1997</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Rural Affairs (Mr. Tim Boswell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Farm Woodland (Amendment) Scheme 1997.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Farm Woodland Premium Scheme 1997.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I preface my remarks by saying how pleasant it is to serve under your chairmanship, Sir Michael, and also to make a small declaration of personal interest to the Committee. It will be a matter of record in the Register of Members' Interests that I have a family farm, one aspect of which is a modest involvement with both the farm woodland scheme and now the farm woodland premium scheme. These are small interests and I remitted the decision on payment rates to my ministerial colleague, but I felt it appropriate to explain to the Committee what we were proposing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The orders are intended to introduce certain changes to the farm woodland premium scheme and its predecessor, the farm woodland scheme, to increase payment rates and to make the schemes more flexible. They are presented in accordance with section 2 of the Farm Land and Rural Development Act 1988. They were laid before the House on 12 February and have been considered by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. They apply in Great Britain only; similar but separate arrangements operate in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it will be helpful if I give the background to the schemes. In 1988, there was considerable concern about growing agricultural surpluses and the need to develop alternative land uses to agriculture. As a partial response, we pioneered the innovative pilot farm woodland scheme. This offered payments to farmers over periods of up to 40 years to compensate for the agriculture income forgone when they planted trees on their land. The payments were part-funded by the European Union under the agricultural structures regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pilot scheme was reviewed after five years and its successor, the farm woodland premium scheme, was launched in 1992. The changes introduced into the farm woodland premium scheme included increased payments over a shorter period, a reduction in the minimum eligible area and a number of simplifications. This scheme is also part-funded by the European Union, under regulation 2080/92 on forestry measures in agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schemes have been successful. Up to March 1996, nearly 46,000 hectares had been approved for
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
planting in the United Kingdom, some 75 per cent. being of predominately broad-leaved plantings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the scheme was introduced, we promised to review it and report to Parliament within five years. The review took place in 1995–96. Economic and environmental evaluations of the scheme in each of the four countries of the United Kingdom were commissioned from external consultants. Views on the scheme were sought from the main farming, forestry and environmental interests. In the light of the evaluations and views received, we conducted a detailed policy review of the scheme which resulted in a number of recommendations. A report was laid before Parliament on 24 July last year, summarising the changes proposed, and shortly afterwards a detailed consultation paper was issued. That consultation paper was sent to farming, forestry and environmental interests, and placed in the Library of the House. Following that exercise, our final intentions were announced on 12 December last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have seen representations from the National Farmers Union about the order. Can my hon. Friend assure me that he has considered those representations and met the union's concerns?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have indeed seen the NFU's representations and its members have made their own input into the consultation process as well. I would be a bold man to suggest that we can ever wholly meet their wishes in every respect. I am sure that they would like a more generous scale of payments for the scheme. However, we have in large measure responded to the NFU's concerns, particularly to the administrative concerns that have been a bugbear for a lot of farmers in applying for that involvement. We will certainly continue to keep in close touch with them and other interests, and to evaluate the new scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To recap, our final intentions were announced on 12 December last year and a list of changes was placed in the Library. The orders would enact those aspects of the proposed changes where legislative amendments are necessary. The orders also require the approval of the European Commission because of its involvement with funding, and we hope to obtain that in March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our review concluded that considerable public good derived from woodlands, most notably in the form of landscape and wildlife benefits, and that those benefits justified continued public support for the scheme. To maximise them, it is important that woodland should be well planned and managed. We will continue to encourage careful siting, design, planting and management in accordance with the objectives of the particular woodland, through the promotion and advice associated with the farm woodland premium scheme—the continuing scheme—and through the controls and advice that are operated by the Forestry Commission's woodland grant scheme, to which these schemes are typically also eligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objectives of the scheme are being revised to stress the environmental reasons for public subsidy. The new objectives are to enhance the environment through the planting of farm woodlands and, in particular, to improve the landscape, provide new habitats and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0530">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
increase biodiversity. In doing that, land managers should be encouraged to realise the productive potential of woodland as a sustainable land use. The orders will introduce a number of detailed changes to improve the schemes. The first order introduces a new farm woodland premium scheme, and we are also changing the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme 1992 and the Farm Woodland Scheme 1988 so that existing participants can benefit from the proposed changes. I want to describe the most important of those changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we want to increase payment rates, except on unimproved land where we consider the existing rates to be adequate. We are also making some changes to the payment structure, because the evaluation showed that the agricultural income forgone from planting trees was substantially higher on arable land than on grassland. We are therefore introducing a separate, higher rate which will apply to plantings on arable land, which is defined as land that is eligible for the arable area payments scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new rates and payment structure will apply to both new and existing participants, and separate new rates are proposed for those in the old farm woodland scheme. Outside the less-favoured areas, the new farm woodland premium scheme rate will be £300 per hectare for plantings on arable land and £260 per hectare for plantings on improved permanent grassland. Bearing in mind the benefits that many farmers and their successors will derive from woodland on their land, it will be an attractive proposition for many of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we are removing the requirement for participants, once they have been accepted into the scheme, to continue to run an agricultural business. I see that as an important development, which will make the scheme considerably more attractive to farmers who are contemplating retirement from active agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I draw the attention of the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Sir R. Howell) to the fact that it is out of order for him to read newspapers in the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The change will also apply to existing participants and to those in the farm woodland scheme. Farmers will still have to be running an agricultural business to be accepted into the scheme, but we are widening eligibility by broadening the definition of an agricultural business to include arrangements such as grazing licences, where land owners retain some control over the management of the land. We are also introducing more flexibility into the eligibility requirements by removing the current rule that limits application to 50 per cent. of the agricultural area of a holding. That will help the farmer who is contemplating retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the administrative front, as I said, we want to make the scheme easier for farmers to apply for. The revised scheme will therefore be more closely integrated with the woodland grant scheme run by the Forestry Commission, with joint application and acceptance procedures. Effectively, there will be a one-stop shop for the farmer interested in establishing a woodland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Finally, this is a cash limited scheme and we wish to see a wide range of plantings of varying nature and with different objectives. It would therefore not be desirable if the bulk of the funds went to a small number of businesses, to the exclusion of others. With that in mind, we are introducing a maximum area limit of 200 hectares on the area for which any one business can receive farm woodland scheme payments. The definition of a business will be similar to that used for farmers' integrated agricultural control system applications; in other words, it will include all the land that a person manages in the UK. The limit will apply only to plantings ensuing from applications received on or after 1 April 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, the intention of the changes is to make the farm woodland premium scheme more attractive and thereby help to increase the amount of woodland on agricultural land around our towns and in our countryside, not only for our benefit but for the benefit of our children and our children's children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that in mind, I have pleasure in commending these draft statutory instruments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.41 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pendle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We support the scheme and oppose neither the proposed changes nor the increase in payments. We regard the order as evidence of the Government's good intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The broad policy was set out in the rural White Paper, which stated that the Government want there to be a doubling of woodland in England over the next half century. They believe that that will be possible, given the range of existing incentives and the necessary future changes in the common agricultural policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objective is laudable, but I am not sure that the order will take us much further forward. The take-up of the farm woodland premium scheme has been very poor. The figures in MAFF's most recent annual report show that there were 917 applications in 1993–94. That figure fell to 693 in 1994–95, and the number of applications in 1995–96 is estimated at 1,200. The changes in June 1995 would account for some of that, but the overall take-up has been disappointing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NFU circulated a brief to members, which stated that since its launch the scheme
	<br><blockquote><p>"has failed to meet its original objectives of bringing substantial planting to farmed areas."</p></blockquote>
The NFU cites three reasons for that. First, it states that the incentive payments are inadequate. Interestingly, the consultants report to which the Minister referred found that 80 per cent. of the total area planted would not have been planted if there had been no grant aid or annual payments. However, the NFU maintains that the incentive payments are too low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the NFU states that there is continued uncertainty about reform of the common agricultural policy. Finally, the NFU cites bureaucratic application procedures for the scheme's failure. The NFU considers that even with the proposed changes, significant farm woodland expansion remains unlikely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the greatest incentive to the planting of woodland, copses and so on over the past 200 years has been not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0531">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Government grants but the existence of country sports, especially shooting, in which fanners wish to engage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a view that the NFU would share. I am familiar with the views of the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh), but he is out of step with the NFU and his party on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn in detail to the criticisms. The first is that the schemes that are already in place—the farm woodland scheme and the farm woodland premium scheme—have not been properly promoted. Entec, the firm of consultants that was commissioned by the Government, said as much. It advised the Government that if the schemes were to take off, there would need to be campaigns to raise awareness. The consultants discovered that a high percentage of non-participants were unaware that any Government grants were available for the planting of woodlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultants went on to say that the personnel involved in the implementation and promotion of the schemes should be far more proactive. I hope that, following the orders, much more effort will be put into raising awareness in the farming community. I see from the press release issued by the Department in December that a booklet called "Farm Woodlands: an introductory guide" is being prepared. I am not sure whether that is available yet, but I will welcome it when it lands on my desk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point that the Minister stressed is the schemes' complexity. The consultants advised that the schemes' application procedures should be simplified. They said that at the very least, there should be one application form. The Government have ignored the next recommendation and I should like the Minister to explain why when he comes to reply. The consultants recommended that either the Forestry Authority or the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Welsh Office Agriculture Department should take "full"—that word is highlighted in the text—
	<br><blockquote><p>"responsibility for the promotion, approval, policing and disbursement of grants".</p></blockquote>
That has not happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has told us that there will be a concession and as the press release says, there will be a single application form in Great Britain
	<br><blockquote><p>"with applications processed in parallel by the Forestry Commission and agriculture departments, and a single approval issued."</p></blockquote>
I simply do not understand that. More bureaucracy is created by dealing with those applications in parallel rather than following the consultants' advice to bring everything together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am on the subject of simplifying matters, the Minister said glibly that this would be a new one-stop shop. I hope that it will. The consultants said that more than half the fanners and landowners consulted about the implementation of the scheme before the changes that the Minister has outlined said that it was unnecessarily complex and confusing. They did not understand why there was a division of responsibility between the Forestry Authority and Government Departments, which they said unnecessarily duplicated
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
effort. If changes were necessary, the report commissioned by the Government underlines why we need to act on its recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other criticisms were flagged up. A significantly high percentage of the people successfully applying for grants under the scheme planted only the very minimum to be eligible for farm woodland premium payments. Small areas were planted, often with ornamental tree varieties inapppropriate to the landscape. That flies in the face of the objectives which were set out by the Minister. Another worrying discovery was that some applicants for grants under the scheme had neglected woodlands on their land. The consultants asked, quite rightly, whether it is proper to pay over public funds to farmers who neglect woods on their land. The Minister should comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pick up on a small but important point about planting in nitrate-sensitive areas. Some species of tree scavenge nitrogen and reduce nitrogen run-off—an example is the riparian willow—but the Timber Growers Association tells me that woodland planting in nitrate-sensitive areas is negligible. The Government could take a policy initiative to encourage fanners in such areas to plant willows and other trees that scavenge nitrogen. I do not for the life of me understand why nothing has happened in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not want to be too critical. I endorse and welcome the environmental benefits which will come from the schemes, if and when they are firing on all cylinders. The Government have taken important initiatives in the past, such as the laudable community forest initiative, which will cover 3.6 per cent. of land in England. The Forestry Authority is also doing excellent work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Forests and woods encourage and enrich biodiversity. Urban citizens enjoy forest walks. The Forestry Commission is talking about having open-air concerts in our forests and woods, which will appeal to many young people. We should be aware that there is water of high quality under forests because there are many threats to high-quality drinking water across the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the schemes and hope that they will be successful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) to the Opposition Front Bench.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman said, a great undertaking would be required to realise the aspiration which is outlined in the rural White Paper—doubling forest area over the next 50 years. We have done such work over a 70-year period—it began with the inception of the Forestry Commission and support for private woodlands has been provided since 1919—and hope to accelerate that over the coming period. As he acknowledged, a great deal of the total effort depends on the future evolution and reform of the common agricultural policy and on the incentives for farmers to

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
continue to plant land which would otherwise be available for arable production, which might be more profitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman might have said more about the fact that not everything in woodland creation is done through the farm woodland premium scheme. There is also the woodland grant scheme, and that which is factored into the farm woodland scheme is also available in the wider context of afforestation. It would be wrong to put all the emphasis on the farm woodland schemes, although they are an important part of total planting. I also take odds with the hon. Gentleman as to the impact that they have produced, because the cumulative figures, to which I referred, indicate that the uptake is now of the order of 50,000 hectares—a significant number from nearly 8,000 applications. We do not necessarily want it all to be in large blocks—it is farm woodland—and we want as many people as possible to be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to draw the attention of the Committee to the new availability, which my right hon. and learned Friend, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was anxious to negotiate, of farm woodlands for planting on set-aside land—or land that can be counted against one's set-aside entitlement. That is a major and important element, which will help to stimulate farm interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the hon. Gentleman's general points about fanner awareness of the schemes, it is understandable that any new scheme will take time to get under way. We continue to press for greater awareness, and we have a number of plans for raising it. A new booklet will be available in the autumn and I shall ensure that the hon. Gentleman receives a copy of it. An earlier practical guide has been reprinted and is available. Free advice is also available for farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the NFU point about the need for a simpler procedure. As far as the farmer is concerned, there will be a single procedure—there is no question of that—as opposed to the sequential procedure of the past, which has caused some practical difficulties. One of my constituents has had to deal with such problems. Fanners will be able to approach the Forestry Authority and the case will be considered in parallel. It will not be considered as one scheme because it is not one scheme. It is a woodland grant scheme—a Forestry Authority scheme—and a farm woodland premium scheme—a MAFF scheme. There are implications for European Union funding and eligibility for set aside is another issue. I hope that fanners will apply in one place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case—I follow the Minister's logic—I want to ask about the consultants Entec, who were commissioned by the Government and produced an extensive and exhaustive report. Were they unaware of the fact that it was impossible to bring all the schemes together for administration either by the Forestry Authority or by Government Departments? Or did they misunderstand the position when they made their recommendations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be characteristic that when the Government commissions independent reports, they are
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
considered very carefully. We try to brief the consultants closely on the implications. However, it would be unusual and unfortunate if we were to commit ourselves in advance to do precisely everything that is recommended. Our considered and balanced view is that it is right to continue as we are. It will make no substantial difference to farmers who need not be deterred from proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised some other points. One was about nitrate-sensitive areas. A fanner can apply in those areas but the application cannot be the subject of an NSA undertaking. It is an incentive scheme and we work broadly on the basis of one scheme or another. I should also make it clear that it is possible to plant willows under the scheme. In nitrate-sensitive areas, there has been considerable success in reducing nitrogen in low ground—particularly in boreholes—in connection with our pattern of incentives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to refer to an issue mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle in a telling intervention. I doubt whether we can conclude the issue now and we cannot debate it at length in this Committee. However, I share my hon. Friend's sympathy for country sports. I know that many farmers enjoy participating in them. As farms are diversifying, a range of habitats are provided—for game birds and for wild birds, which usually co-exist easily. That improves the value of their property and its attractiveness for shooting and other country sports. I am sure that that is a motive. I hope that it is a bonus alongside the premia that we are able to offer, but there may always be political differences on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any case, despite the slightly less generous remarks of the hon. Member for Pendle about the characteristics of the planting that were flagged up in the consultants report, the evaluation made it clear that most planting met environmental objectives. The average area was not piffling, it was about 7 hectares—significant, but not huge. While encouraging the expansion of farm woodland, we intend to emphasise the importance of sensitive and thoughtful design. In my own case, what has just been planted is a better concept than what was planted initially under the farm woodland scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government want to maximise the multiple benefits the woodlands can bring by means of the amendments in these orders and through the other measures to increase the area of woodland—the hon. Gentleman will know of the joint initiative undertaken by the Forestry Commission and the Countryside Commission—and through CAP reform. The changes represent once step forward in our efforts to increase the area of woodland. I hope that they will benefit farmers, the environmental interests carried by farm woodland, the countryside and all those who visit and enjoy it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In responding to the hon. Gentleman's welcome for the changes, I say to the Committee that we regard the schemes as positive and that the changes are designed to make them even more successful in the period before the next review. I commend the orders to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
