</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Happy new year to you, Sir Michael. I am sure that I say that on behalf of all members of the Committee. With your leave, may I extend the congratulations of the Opposition to the Minister of State on his elevation to the Privy Council? I know that he will not take offence when I say that that is the least he deserves after his years of labouring in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>538</span>
The clause arises from an idea that has been put into practice by some schools on an entirely voluntary basis. Many people, including the Labour party, have argued that such a provision should be more widely extended. The Government have proceeded from excellent intentions, but the drafting of the clause is ill thought out and could have unlooked for and damaging consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to improve the Bill by retaining those good and laudable elements to which I have already referred, while eliminating the problematic aspects of its current drafting. We all agree that parents should be given every encouragement to support the education of their children and the schools that they attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also agree that schools should be clear about what they expect of pupils and parents and the ways in which they will help parents supports their children in the learning process. It is eminently sensible that such matters should be clearly written down in a document so that all parties know where they stand. However, there are worrying elements about a law that allows schools to choose whether they will offer such a document and which allows them to impose their version of what it should contain, with the sanction of refusing a place at the school if the parents do not comply. The Government are keen advocates of patental choice, but providing a charter for some schools to browbeat parents in such a way is hardly an enchancement of parental choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the public debate that has surrounded the issue, there has been much talk of home-school contracts or partnership agreements. The Bill avoids reference to the terms "contract" or "agreement", and advisely so. I see that the Minister is nodding his head in agreement. Such words are associated with voluntary arrangements between parties of more or less equal standing, and they cannot properly be used to describe a situation in which one party can dictate terms to another. Yet we are faced with a Bill that is weighted in favour of shools, under which a school can choose whether to offer a partnership document and determine its content whereas parents must accept the school's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the clause is not as simple as that. It recognises that there is a potential conflict between the ability of a school to refuse admission to a child whose parents will not sign an agreement and the right of access to free education. It makes it clear that admissions authorities can waive the requirement to sign. It gives the Secretary of State the power to strike down unacceptable conditions and to prevent certain kinds of requirements from being imposed on parents. The proposed new section 413B(6) states that the documents
	<br><q><p>"shall not be capable of creating any obligation in respect of whose breach any liability arises in contract or in tort."</p></q>
In short, it is conceded that the documents are legally unenforceable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document purports to be enforceable but, on closer inspection, its sanctions are revealed to be ineffective. What will be the practical result of that? The majority of parents actively support their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>539</span>
children's education and want to work with their children's schools. For them, the enactment of this part of the Bill will make no difference. Such parents would happily sign a statutory document, just as they would subscribe to an informal non-statutory one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what of the minority—the good but argumentative parents who are keen supporters of their children's education but who may object to particular sections of the partnership document; or parents who have a principled objection to being required to sign such a document? Such objections could give rise to disputes. The school could refuse entry to the children, or it might back down, waiving the requirement for the document to be signed. The parents' choice of school would thus have been defeated—for no particularly good reason—or the authority of the school would have been undermined. Neither outcome is desirable. In both cases, time and energy will have been expended, resulting in damage to the relationship between the school and the community that it seeks to serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, less conscientious parents, who had less regard for their child's education, might readily sign the necessary papers to enable them to secure the child's place in the school but subsequently pay no heed to their responsibilities. Once the child was on the school roll, the sanction of refusing admission would fall and the school would be no more able to procure the appropriate behaviour of the parent than it was before. In most cases the Bill will have secured no practical advantage, but in a small number of cases it may be unhelpful or have damaging consequences. That is a poor basis for law making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The beneficial effects of the amendments are several. The Bill would be shorter and more concise, something that is always desirable in legislation. The amendments would remove all connections between the partnership document and the admissions process. That would do away with some real administrative complexities and avoid potential conflicts between the Bill and other legislation, which would prevent those provisions being misused. The Opposition and the Government may have differeing views about the value of selection, but I should be surprised if many advocates of selective admission arrangements were entirely comfortable with the selective refusal of places in ostensibly nonselective schools, which is what the clause presently sanctions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most important, however, the amendments would require every school to draw up a statement of what it understood to be the mutual rights and responsibilities of the school and the parents. That would ensure that every parent knew where the school stood on important issues. This would provide an opportunity for mature dialogue between parents and schools, would allow all parents to know what the school could offer them and what it would expect of them, and would provide a vehicle to assist schools in encouraging parents to live up to their duties and responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that the documents would be the result of mature discussion. If those documents have to be signed before the child arrives at the school, will the hon. Gentleman explain how there can be an opportunity for mature discussion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Discussions can take place in a variety of contexts. In the first instance, it can take place in the generality of debate between parent governors and head teachers and school staff. However, I believe that the Government should provide guidelines on what expectations they have—that any Government ought to have—of partnership agreements. I do not mean that in a legalistic sense but in the broader sense; as I said a moment ago, the Government have wisely avoided the use of such words, but they should describe the sort of framework within which such agreements would be drawn up. My personal belief is that a general form of agreement should be available within schools which subscribes to national guidelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In short, the amendments allow for all the positive features of a home-school partnership. I am happy for the Government to take the matter up and we shall be supportive. The amendments seek also to remove the Bill's inherent disadvantages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall have the chance to speak at greater length when we come to the next group of amendments. As to this group, I am concerned not so much by the wording of the amendments moved by the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) as by what he said and by comments made outside the Committee by various Labour Members on partnership agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be fair to characterise the Government's proposals in the Bill by saying that they believe that there may be some merit in some form of agreement reached between parent and school but that they will leave it to the admission authorities to determine whether such a document and such an approach will be used—they are taking a permissive approach. My concern with that, as I shall explain in greater detail later—if I catch your eye, Sir Michael—is that it will lead, as the hon. Member for Walton implied, to a new form of selection, which would worry me enormously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Walton seems to imply that the solution to that problem is that all schools should have such a document; he wants to remove the permissive approach proposed by the Government, which no doubt the Minister will describe to us, and impose one that will apply in every case, so that every parent will be required to be a signatory to some form of document. As the hon. Member for Walton said, that document will have some central components provided by Government and will be developed and added to by the individual school. As I suggested in my intervention, that is almost as worrying as the approach proposed by the Government. Surely the most important element of a home-school partnership is the development of that partnership over a period of time; it is the process of the development of the arrangement that is important, not the actual signing of a document. As I said, the Labour party's proposal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>541</span>
for the signing of a document, with all the associated legal problems, is as worrying as the Government's approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Education and Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first thank the hon. Member for Walton for his kind remarks. Many people believe that the honour that I have been given is the nearest that I shall get to being PC but, needless to say, I welcome it very much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am intrigued and slightly puzzled by the line of argument that has emerged this morning on this important part of the Bill. The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) is correct in his description of our view. The concept of home-school agreements or partnerships is already well established. Many schools have developed the approach and believe that it is positive and can work well for them. We want to support and encourage that, which is why we included the provision in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Bath anticipated me in saying, we want to make agreements permissive rather than compulsory for the reasons that we argue in most cases—the matter is best decided at school level. I do not think that the measure should be compulsory, any more than I take the view that mandatory homework makes much sense. That may well remain a difference between Government and Opposition—who knows? Not only do many schools already operate home-school agreements but our admissions circular last year allowed for the possibility that admissions to a school could be tied to the fact that a parent adheres to a home-school agreement. The precedent has been established; all that we are doing is to confirm it in statutory form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede one part of the argument of the hon. Member for Walton. He said that the provision tipped the balance in favour of schools—"weighted in favour of schools", was, I think, the exact expression that he used. That is true, and deliberately so, for this important reason. The Government have talked over and over again in recent years about parental rights, and we have gone to great lengths to establish parental rights to express a preference for a school, to give parents a role in electing governors, to establish school annual general meetings, and so on. It is now time to talk more in terms of parental responsibilities. If this provision does one thing, it enhances and encourages the role of parental responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If in that sense—and only in that sense—the balance will be tipped somewhat in favour of schools, as the hon. Gentleman puts it, rather than in favour of parents, that is welcome and should be beneficial. We have surely reached the point where we must challenge parents to take up their responsibilities, having given them so many rights. Home-school agreements—partnership agreements—are an important way of doing that. That is why it is right to tie home-school agreements to admission arrangements. It is perfectly in order for a school to challenge parents and to tell them, "Your child may enter this school, but on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>542</span>
explicit understanding through this agreement that you, the parents, will do everything in your power to support the ethos and the rules of the school."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Staffordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What happens to the small minority of children whose parents do not want to take that responsibility and refuse to sign the contract? What happens to those children if they cannot enter the school? Where will they go to complete their education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, the statutory responsibility for educating the child lies with the parents; that remains so. Parents who gratuitously refused to accept the home-school agreements tied to the admission arrangements of every school in the area would have to answer in the normal way for their statutory responsibility for educating their child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is of course always possible for a child to be educated otherwise than at school. A surprising number of pupils are educated otherwise than at school through arrangements made by their parents, but that remains the parents' responsibility—I do not shy from that. If a parent wants to exercise judgment or conscience—call it what you will—and says that he cannot and will not accept the requirements laid down in the home-school agreements of all the schools available in his area, the question lies with the parent, and rightly so, as to what he is doing to discharge his responsibility to ensure that his child is educated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I did not make myself clear. I am talking not about articulate parents but about parents who do not believe in the system of authority and who behave anti-socially. We need to take those very children from such an environment and socialise and educate them. What happens to children if their parents refuse to agree to the rules and regulations that are laid down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would imagine that in such cases the courts would play their usual role. The education welfare officer for the area would be aware of the fact that a parent was failing to arrange for the education of the child and would seek to take the parent to court in the normal way. The court would then make the appropriate arrangements for the parents to be sanctioned or for the child to be educated outside the parents' direct responsibility. That is not novel; it is an existing and important part of the educational regime. I gladly take this opportunity to praise the work of education welfare officers, who do a difficult job in difficult circumstances dealing with such parents who do exist and who may well surface under the arrangements proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is agreement—as the hon. Member for Walton was generous enough, typically, to acknowledge—within the Committee on the important role that such agreements can play, which has been demonstrated already, and on the way in which they can have a beneficial effect on parents' attitudes. However, there is an honest difference between us: my view and that of my colleagues is that such matters are best left to the schools' discretion, whereas Labour Members—I think that the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>543</span>
Member for Bath dissents—believe that compulsion should be used. We disagree about that. Our view is that such matters can and should be tied to admission arrangements in order to give them effect, but Opposition Members take a different view, which is paradoxical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that there is any way of squaring the differences between us. My view is that the arrangements under the Bill, which are well thought out and based on experience, are the way ahead. For those reasons, I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I cannot but agree with much of what the Minister has said, because he has acknowledged the broad basis of agreement on the principle of home-school partnerships, and he has been entirely consistent. The one matter on which we disagree is on the use of home-school partnerships, contracts, agreements, or whatever one calls them, as yet another form of selection. In that sense, the proposals are entirely consistent with the earlier parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot dispute the fact that there is an honest difference between us, but I am taken with the Minister's Pauline conversion to the interests of schools. After years of trying to undermine schools and of peddling illusory ideals of parental choice and rights, the Minister has now acknowledged that they are not uppermost in his or the Government's mind, because they have come up against some of the practical, less beneficial effects of earlier legislation. Nevertheless, we might return to such matters on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Committee that I intend to be brief. I agree with the hon. Gentleman for Walton that one of the disputes between the Opposition and Government is on the use of partnership agreements as the basis of selection. I have made it clear in Committee and elsewhere that it is wholly wrong that children might not be allowed to attend a school if their parents refuse to sign such documents. Honest parents who have difficulty controlling their children will find it difficult to sign documents that require good
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>544</span>
behaviour on the part of their children and, therefore, those children will be excluded automatically from a school. However, more dishonest parents might sign the document and, their children might therefore be allowed to attend the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In later days, weeks, months or years, when those children misbehave, there shall be a problem about the sanctions that can be imposed on their parents. I am sure that the Minister would accept that there is difficulty with both the imposition of such sanctions and the legality of basing admission to schools on such documents. As I have said before, the introduction of the Government's policy will lead to a form of selection more pernicious than any now used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I have been somewhat remiss in not beginning my speech by congratulating the Minister on his elevation. I have passed on congratulations privately. However, that elevation does not mean that the Minister is necessarily a better man for having some initials attached to his name. Many of us believe that he continues to make a number of mistakes, as he has with several parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only yesterday, I had sent to me a rather belated copy of the 	<i>Dorset Evening Echo,</i> dated Saturday 9 November. The story pointed out a significant problem in the Minister's spelling capabilities. He sent a letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) telling her, quite properly, that he intended to visit her constituency. He not only got wrong the day of the week on which he would visit and the date, but managed to spell wrongly the names of all three schools that he intended to visit. I doubt whether his elevation over Christmas will change those capabilities. My point is that nothing has changed over Christmas to make us believe that the Minister's proposals are any better now than before the recess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put on record my support for one thing that the Minister has said. He said that the rights of parents have been discussed for a long time—quite rightly—and that it was now time to focus on parents' reciprocal responsibilities. I entirely agree with that. However, I do not believe that—under either the permissive approach promoted by the Minister or the mandatory approach proposed by the Labour Party—it would be right to have a document that parents must sign before the child has even entered a school. That approach gives no possibility of developing the kind of home-school partnership arrangements that I believe to be important in all schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who have read the National Commission on Education's excellent document on what constitutes a successful school will know that, after clear leadership, one of the key features in schools is the development of effective home-school relationships. Nothing can do more damage to such a relationship than beginning—before the child even enters school—with the signing of such a document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee is not prepared to take my word for that, other proof exists. The Minister has often stressed the importance of consultation. As an honourable man—certainly after his recent elevation—the Minister will accept that one must take

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>545</span>
notice of what is said in consultation. On home-school relationships, it is presumably important to listen to organisations that represent the home, parents and interests in the wider education community. I hope that the Minister will be interested in the views of the Campaign for State Education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave way to the hon. Gentleman because I believed that during the Christmas recess he might have had a change of heart and decided to make helpful contributions to the Committee. Clearly, I made a mistake. I am sure that the hon. Member for Walton will want to make an educational point, so I shall give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. Given the long list of organisations that he suggested to the Minister—all of which were rejected—will he add the suggestion made from a sedentary position by my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson)? will the hon. Gentleman ask the Minister whether he would take the views of the Conservative Education Association seriously?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>546</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hopes of what had happened over the Christmas period were clearly in vain. I had assumed that by now the hon. Member for Walton would not have thrown the name of the Conservative Education Association at the Minister expecting any answer other than the one that he received. The Minister has made his views on that organisation very clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned those organisations because they have all made their views on the Government's proposals clear in a succinct letter that they wrote jointly to 	<i>The Independent</i> on 14 December last year. I am sure that the Committee will want to hear a brief extract from that letter because it makes the position clear. The letter states:
	<br><q><p>"Sir: We write as organisations which have been long involved in supporting ways in which parents and schools might be encouraged to work together to help children learn.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>We are opposed to proposals in the Education Bill, currently in committee, which will allow admission authorities, either local education authorities or grant-maintained and voluntary school governing bodies, to make a condition of admission to a school that the parent sign a 'parental declaration'—a home-school contract.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Parents already have little real choice. Now they could be obliged to sign a contract if their local school is oversubscribed. Since the parent will be obliged to sign the document before the child is even allowed to go to the school the proposal has nothing to do with encouraging home-school partnership, but is, in fact, another form of selection."</p></q>
I concur with that view-both the concern about it being a selection procedure and, secondly, in relation to the proposal of the hon. Member for Walton, that it has nothing to do with home-school partnership. I very much hope that my amendments will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In thanking the hon. Gentleman for his kind remarks, I can only express the hope that being a member of the Privy Council in some way improves spelling. I have not had that suggested to me before, but in the light of the hon. Gentleman's strictures, I hope that that is so. It is ironic because I have always taken great pride in my spelling ability. I shall go back to the Department later and study the letter that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. Whether I could have been expected to know the correct spelling of schools in Christchurch and Dorset remains to be seen, but I guess that I should have been able to distinguish one day of the week from another. Perhaps I was just having a bad day, but I shall examine the point that the hon. Gentleman raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can deal with the important issue raised by the hon. Member for Bath fairly briefly because it relates to our earlier discussion on the previous amendment. We are talking about how to carry forward the important matter of the role and responsibility of parents in trying to improve education and their relationship with schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Bath and for Walton seem to think that if they say often enough that allowing home-school arrangements to be tied to admission arrangements constitutes a form of selection, that somehow resolves the matter, making the scheme undesirable and unacceptable so that we should abandon it. Committee members know that I and my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>547</span>
colleagues do not find those statements frightening or off-putting; if Opposition Members choose to express their views in that way, that is a matter for them. It is more important to give schools the opportunity to place squarely on parents the responsibilities that they should be prepared to accept in regard to their children's education. I do not shrink from that; it is high time that we tipped the balance in that direction. I am not surprised that organisations which claim, in some mysterious, unspecified way, to be representative of parents, but which rarely are—which is why I was not prepared to accept a list of them as simply the end of the matter—resist the idea that parents should take more responsibility than they have hitherto been prepared to take. They would say that, just as trade unions often see it as their role blindly to protect their members, regardless of what they have done; I am not surprised that organisations, which see it as their role to protect parents against being required to take more responsibility for their children's education, react negatively, which is why I do not in this case accept their views. We are therefore talking about a simple, but vital, difference of interpretation. Conservative Members believe that it is right to demand that parents take a much greater role and responsibility in their children's education and in their relationship with the school, and that that demand is long overdue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we can better place that demand on parents, as I believe we can, by enabling schools to tie the carefully worked out home-school agreement with parents to their admission arrangements, that is a good thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is starting to worry me with his line on permissive legislation, which encourages schools to adopt home-school contracts. He constantly harks back to parents' responsibilities and seems to assume—that is the message that I am receiving loud and clear—that parents are failing their children and that the state will ensure that they do not continue to do so. The nanny state is alive and well, and living with the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Coming from an hon. Member whose leader said the other day that he would legislate for children to do homework, that is pretty rich. I do not shrink from any accusation that Opposition Members care to make that I seek ways of enhancing parents' role in and responsibilities for their children's education—I am completely guilty of that. If Opposition Members wish to interpret the clause in that way, they are entitled to do so. It is for those reasons that I stand firmly by the present wording of the Bill and I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, Sir Michael, I offer my congratulations to the Minister on his membership of the Privy Council. Our relationship goes back to 1979, when the Minister was a Member of the European Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not remind me of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that great damage could be done if the views that the Minister held at that time became public knowledge now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause has a specific purpose. In a sense, it can be regarded as either a direct follow-up to clause 26 or a probe to the Minister. We want clarification of the Government's views on responsibility for the treatment of exclusions and discipline, and responsibility for pupils who have been proved to have emotional and behavioural problems that result in disaffection with school and bad behaviour while there, or who leave school of their own accord. This part of the Bill is designed to ensure that local education authorities and schools take a focused approach to disciplinary issues and to ensure that exclusions are used properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exclusion is an important step which, when used, has a follow-up in terms of the provision to be made for a child who has been excluded. We wholeheartedly support the Government's views. We have felt for some time that a focused approach was necessary. The Elton report of 1989 made a host of recommendations. However, when there is a lack of specific and concentrated drive and leadership, either nationally from the Department or locally from LEAs, focus is lost. If that happens, it is unlikely that recommendations will be implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise the importance of tackling behavioural problems and of ensuring that schools are given appropriate support to help them cope with such problems and with exclusions. The Government's declared aim is to try to ensure that schools have a greater share of the potential school budget or to reduce the number of mandatory exceptions to what should be in the potential school budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are thus a host of questions about what the Government see as the new, or developing, relationship between the education budget to local education authorities and the part of it that should be regarded as the potential school budget. Will the amount from the potential school budget, which is currently running at 90 per cent. plus in most cases, be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>549</span>
ratcheted up to an even greater extent? If so, how do the Government envisage local education authorities providing the service set out in clause 26? Will they provide additional funding within the revenue support grant to ensure that it is an effective service, which children and schools will desperately need?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may, on reflection, want to address his questions to his right hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown). The hon. Gentleman legitimately raised a question relating to the provision of funds for education in the context of clause 26 which, on a quick rereading of it, I did not understand to state that any new requirement will be placed on local education authorities. It certainly requires them to produce plans or to publish the arrangements that they will make; it does not, in a strict sense, require them to do anything additional. For some—I hope for many—local education authorities, it will simply require them to formalise what they already do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the more accurate answer to the question put by the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) is that, as he well knows, the mechanism whereby education is funded starts with a general allocation of moneys on a national level to education globally. Then, through the sophisticated mechanisms of rate support grant, standard spending assessments and others developed over many years, with all-party support, we allocate to each local education authority the amount that we think is generally appropriate for it, based on our knowledge of the population that it serves. Then—this is the key point—we leave each local education authority a large amount of discretion about how they use that money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Minister that when he introduced in the House the excellent code of practice for the identification and assessment of special educational needs, there was a major debate about whether it was properly funded. A system that is designed to be more effective in identification and assessment is likely to involve an increase in costs, at least in the early days. The Minister undertook to review the code when it had been in place for three years, which is quite soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will know that exclusions in Wales—and almost certainly elsewhere, too—have increased 10-fold in the past four or five years. The number of pupils in Wales who have statements for emotional and behavioural difficulties has increased in the past few years by almost 15 per cent. That involves the local education authorities in extra expenditure. To what extent, in all the sophisticated mechanisms, have the Government included additional expenditure to cover those needs? To judge from the settlements that local government has received, additional account has not been taken of those needs. Will the Minister specify what additional funding has been made available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether there is a spending pledge hidden in the hon. Gentleman's seductive and tantalising comment because it sounded very like one to me. It sounded as if the hon. Gentleman was hinting that the amount allocated to education was not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>550</span>
sufficient and that he thought there should be more. If that is so, presumably he will follow it with an explicit pledge, perhaps not to the Committee but fairly soon, that his party, were it ever in a position to do so, would find a lot more money to meet the needs that he identified. I will not leave it there, however, as I sense that the Committee is challenging, indeed urging, me to give a fuller answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend assumes that every time we try to identify the needs of particular groups of pupils more formally and precisely, more money must necessarily follow. That is a typical analysis by members of the hon. Gentleman's party, and that is why they will be in increasing difficulty in the next few weeks and months when they do not follow up remarks such as the hon. Gentleman made with the inevitable commitment to spend more money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have always said that identifying more clearly the needs of certain groups of pupils was important—the hon. Gentleman was kind enough to mention my work in connection with special educational needs—we are now dealing with another group who are just as important: disaffected pupils who are out of school because of truancy or because they are excluded. Simply identifying those pupils and their needs does not mean that we must produce more money, either nationally or at LEA level. The local education authority has important budgetary responsibilities in calculating its local management of schools formula and in determining its general, aggregate and potential budgets, and so on. It is thus for the LEA to identify its priorities and to decide how much money it will give to schools to focus on discipline matters to reduce the number of exclusions, or to deal with the pupils who are excluded. Those are matters for the LEA. To say that more money would have to follow in a blind, unreasoning way every time we tried to make better arrangements for special needs, excluded or disaffected pupils would make life much more difficult for any Government. It might even make Government and local education authorities, as educators, less likely to try to solve the long-standing, unresolved difficulties at national and local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept the conncection that the hon. Gentleman makes. The essence of the amendment already exists as the Secretary of State is concerned with the amount allocated to education at national level and, through SSAs and rate support grants, to local education authorities. But at that point, responsibility shifts to the elected, accountable LEAs for what they do locally. They set their priorities, they say where the money will go, they know their communities and they are in the best position to decide what the balance should be between provision for mainstream pupils, those with special educational needs and those who are excluded. The LEAs know best whether money should be directed to the classroom, to the pupil referral unit or to pupils with special educational needs, and so on.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>551</span>
The new clause is redundant. It carries implications that might take the hon. Member for Bridgend where he does not want to go. I certainly do not want to go in that direction, and I ask the Committee to reject the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very disappointed by the Minister's approach in view of his hard work and the strong support that he gave to establishing the code. We are considering a specific matter which we know from what has been happening in schools has become a growing and serious problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what the Minister said about the need for local education authorities to set their priorities. I accept also what he said about the LMS formula. But local authorities have their formulae approved by the Department for Education and Employment in England and by the Welsh Office in Wales. The authorities operate in a framework that fixes at least 90 per cent. of their priorities—and the Government will push the percentage upwards if they get a chance to go beyond that. There are significant constraints on dealing with special educational needs. Some parts of the budget are not part of the potential schools budget; that gives the education authorities some room to work in. But we need a clearer debate between Government at the centre and the local education authorities so that we can work out how to meed needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister challenged me on funding. Over the life of a Parliament, a Labour Government will ensure that a greater proportion of national wealth is spent on education. Part of that will come from the ability to reduce unemployment, freeing money from the social security budget. We shall have those debates at election time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the Minister does not accept that if more and more pupils are disaffected and excluded from schools, the money will have to come from somewhere within the current local authority budgets or from some other budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is cross-party agreement that the introduction of baseline assessments at national level should be welcomed. I put it to the Minister that local education authorities, in their best tradition, have experimented with baseline assessment. In its work to develop a policy on behalf of the Government, the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority has been able to build on LEAs' best practice. SCAA found in its survey that half of the English LEAs are involved in some form of baseline assessment—it is a well-established practice in many schools.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all accept that teachers have always made formative assessments of individual children. That is the traditional approach, one on which we are building to move to a more formalised baseline assessment. I am sure that the Minister will agree that the advantage of that approach is that assessment materials can be used not just in one school but in many, so that results can be moderated across schools and common training can be provided for those involved in the assessment. More importantly, the children's record becomes portable; they can take it with them as they move from school to school, either in the primary sector or between the primary and secondary sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assessments can also be used for diagnostic purposes, although, as I am sure the Minister will agree, we do not want the baseline assessments to become a substitute for a proper special educational needs assessment; we do not want children to be screened out of special needs assessment because of the baseline assessment. I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify the Government's view on that.

Baseline assessments provide a basis on which to place value-added information in measuring performance at 11. Labour Members have argued for that for a long time, so we welcome that move.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>553</span>
We also welcome the way in which SCAA has approached its work. It has collated and synthesised the best practice of LEAs to build the framework that is proposed in the Bill. Labour Members want to congratulate those people in SCAA who have done a good job on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say what the word "future" adds? The purpose of baseline assessment is that it has an immediate rather than a future impact. Once one has made an assessment, one decides what programme is appropriate for the individual child and how the work should be planned, not in the distant future but immediately. We are therefore puzzled by the inclusion of the word "future" in the clause. We do not think that it adds anything, but perhaps the Minister can explain what we have missed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should briefly like to raise some other important points. Will the Minister give us reassurances about the speed at which the Government hope to implement baseline assessments? Many of the LEAs that have experimented with baseline assessments have taken between two and five years to develop a full programme. The Government suggest something much quicker and, although we welcome speed, we do not want to sacrifice quality to it. Will the Minister assure us that quality will not be sacrificed, and that the quality that has been established by many LEAs will be maintained when the scheme is introduced nationwide? Will she also say whether some grant for education support and training—or GEST—moneys will be made available specifically for training purposes as the LEAs get on with the business of making progress with the baseline assessments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome what SCAA said about establishing a national framework rather than a national scheme. That is completely appropriate; we want schemes to meet local needs and priorities. However, clause 33(6) gives a reserve power to the Secretary of State to implement a national scheme. That is not right. I would welcome the Minister's reassurance that it is not the Government's intention to move from a national framework to a national scheme. We welcome the former, but not the latter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power has been given to individual schools to implement schemes, either through their governing bodies or through their head teachers. We shall come to amendments on that matter later. However, common sense suggests that LEA-wide schemes, not school-based schemes. That would allow some comparability between schools in an area. It would also make the scheme portable, so that even if a child changed school, the scheme would stay with that child throughout his or her school career and would therefore help in making future assessments of that child's needs. It would make far more sense to have LEA-wide schemes rather than each school choosing its own scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is proposed that accreditation should be carried out by the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority. What will be the cost, and where will the money come from? What steps have been taken to ensure that we do not build another cumbersome bureaucracy? Given the good record of LEAs in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>554</span>
implementing their own assessment schemes, why is it necessary that every scheme should be accredited by SCAA? Is is more bureaucratic? What is the cost, and what is being done to minimise it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the proposal; I just wonder why the word "future" is included. I should be grateful if the Minister could answer my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mrs. Cheryl Gillan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that both sides of the Committee appear to support the introduction of baseline assessments. Such assessments will play a crucial role in our drive to push up standards, by adding further rigour to our policy of assessment in schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) said that amendment No. 204 is a probing amendment. I shall, of course, resist both amendments to clause 32, but I should like to reassure the hon. Lady about the use of the word "future". The intention is to emphasise that baseline assessment is a forward-looking procedure. The wording was produced by an eminent parliamentary counsel, so I hope that the hon. Lady is not criticising the drafting. It is intended that teachers should use the assessment information to help them plan future classroom activities for each child according to their needs and abilities, particularly drawing on the desirable outcome for children's learning or in the national curriculum programmes of study, whichever is appropriate. I see no reason to accede to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Lady for congratulating SCAA on doing an excellent job. We, too, believe that SCAA has done well. Earlier this month, I sent members of the Committee details of SCAA's proposals on baseline assessment, which I hope was helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady raised other more specific questions, particularly about funding the grant for education support and training. We have already announced that £8.5 million will be put into the GEST programme. I hope that that reassures her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On special educational needs, the baseline assessment will lead to SEN assessement where appropriate, but it will not replace that specialist assessment. Again, I hope that that reassures the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Under-Secretary's response speeds up on proceedings. She rightly said that separate and specialist SEN provision will continue. I am delighted by that. Does she recognise that in developing a baseline assessment scheme that encompasses all children, there may be problems in the case of children with special educational needs? Is there not a need for an alternative scheme for children who have serious special educational needs? How does she see that being catered for?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be improper to single out and exclude special educational needs pupils from a baseline assessment. In many instances, children with special educational needs will be able to fulfil the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>555</span>
baseline assessment criteria and all children should have that opportunity, as I am sure the hon. Member for Barking would agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point that the hon. Lady raised—I am working through myriad notes—was that of accreditation by SCAA. We think that the cost of that will be around £300,000, from SCAA's budget. Bureaucracy will be kept to a minimum by building on local scheme developments; draft criteria for accrediting schemes have been published and show that the process will be simple and straightforward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point made by the hon. Lady related to timing and speed. She should be aware that the SCAA will not offer its final advice to the Secretary of State until the end of this month or the beginning of next, but the enabling clauses are necessary so that we can introduce a nationwide baseline assessment as soon as possible. It will be introduced in September this year, initially on a voluntary basis. Once schools have had the opportunity to choose a baseline assessment scheme that best suits their local needs, the scheme will be introduced on a statutory basis at the earliest opportunity, which is in September 1998.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just wanted to intervene before the Minister sits down. I went through several points rapidly; could she address a couple that she omitted? Can she confirm that the Government do not intend to introduce a national scheme but merely a framework, and will she comment on my point about it making sense, from the point of view of benefiting children and enabling them to have a portable record, to have a consistent approach across an LEA rather than each school selecting its own scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry; I had another sheaf of notes which secreted itself under my file.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power to prescribe a national scheme, as conferred in subsection (6), is a contingent one; it is a dormant provision that enable the Secretary of State to introduce a single national scheme at some stage if it emerges that that is desirable in the light of experience. It is not in our minds at the moment to invoke the measure in the short term. I hope that that is satisfactory. On schemes being LEA-wide, it must be up to individual schools to implement baseline assessment so they must be able to choose their preferred scheme, although I note what the hon. Lady says on that matter. I hope that in the light of my having responded as fully as I can to all the questions asked by the hon. Lady, she will withdraw the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Sir Michael, for allowing the two groups of amendments to be considered together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is clearly widespread agreement about the advantages that baseline assessment can bring to pupils by improving both teaching and learning. The amendment concerns how schools should choose baseline assessment schemes, and I hope that it will find some sympathy with the Under-Secretary. Under the Bill as drafted, it would be the responsibility of the governing body to choose what system of baseline assessment a school would use. The amendment would move that responsibility to the head teacher of the primary school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We of course accept the importance of governing bodies and the role that they play in the life of the school in setting overall objectives, in leadership and in the accountability that they offer to parents and to the local community. However, deciding on a particular version of baseline assessment calls for the professional knowledge and expertise of the head teacher and teachers—expertise which the governing body does not necessarily have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may draw a parallel with the GCSE or A-level syllabus. It is widely accepted that the decision about which of the many syllabuses a school follows in any subject should be left to the head teacher and the subject teachers. In the same way, we feel that it would be more appropriate for the decision about the system of baseline assessment to be in the hands of the head teacher rather than the governing body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>557</span>
Given that baseline assessment is comparatively new, the number of schemes from which a school may choose will no doubt increase. I also expect that in a year's time, or perhaps after slightly longer, given types of baseline assessment will be amended. If a scheme is amended in only a small way, the decision whether to continue with it would still have to be referred to the governing body, because it might want to change its mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will consider the amendment; it does not threaten baseline assessment and it is certainly not intended to undermine the role of governors in the school. However, it places the decision where it ought to be: in the hands of those with teaching and learning expertise and under the command and control of the head teacher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Sir Michael, for grouping these two previously separate sets of amendments together. I should give advance notice that I intend carefully to consider amendments Nos. 189 to 194, but to resist amendments Nos. 205, 206 and 207.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 189 to 194 appear to have been tabled for two purposes. First, they would give the head teacher the responsibility of selecting the baseline assessment scheme, with the duty to adopt such a scheme remaining with the governing body. Secondly, they would lift the duty for the governing body of an LEA-maintained school to consider the baseline assessment scheme selected by the LEA when choosing such a scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady's remarks, and I tend to agree with the thrust of her argument. The prime objective is to ensure that every primary school selects and adopts a baseline assessment scheme that meets the criteria of the proposed national framework. I note that the amendments recognise that the particular duty to adopt a baseline assessment scheme should rest with the governing body. I also recognise that head teachers will have professional views on the content and style of the baseline assessment schemes likely to be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it comes to choosing which scheme to adopt, it would be sensible for the governing body to draw on the professional judgment of the head teacher. That is why subsection (5) places a requirement on the governing body to consult the head teacher when adopting a scheme. In practice, it is essentially a matter of professional judgment on which the governing bodies will wish to defer to the views of head teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister envisage that, under the clause, a governing body could delegate that decision to a head teacher if it so wished?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is something that I must examine, which is why I wish to give the amendments some further thought. I hope that the hon. Lady will not press me at this stage because we are in agreement, but the matter concerns how we bring about what we both want to achieve. It is essential for the governing body to consult the head teacher and to rely on the head teacher's professional advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>558</span>
Amendment No. 192 would remove subsection (5) from the clause. In addition to lifting the governing body's duty to consult the head teacher, which is consequential to amendment No. 189, it would also remove the requirement for an LEA-maintained school to consider the scheme selected by the LEA when choosing which baseline scheme to adopt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SCAA's proposals for a national framework for baseline assessment recognises that many LEAs have already carried out work in developing local baseline schemes. I have no doubt that Opposition Members are familiar with that, especially the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris) with the Birmingham scheme. The national framework builds on such local initiatives. I recall particularly the scheme in Wandsworth, but for a different reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to make the baseline assessment of all young children starting school a reality in our primary schools, and LEAs clearly have a role in that process. To enable the operation of a national framework, subsection (4) places a duty on LEAs to select an accredited baseline assessment scheme, which they consider suitable to be adopted by the governing bodies of primary schools that are maintained by LEAs. I should have thought that Opposition Members would also agree with the logic in primary schools maintained by LEAs at least considering the baseline assessment scheme selected by the LEA. In practice, I believe that that may well happen anyway. There may be a need to provide for it on the statute book, but I am happy to afford to all schools the freedom to bypass their local authority if that was what the hon. Lady was pressing for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not convinced that the amendments are 100 per cent. workable. I wish to consider amendments Nos. 189 to 194 and I undertake to bring forward a revised clause on Report. I shall not accept amendments Nos. 205 to 207 and, given my undertaking, I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw all the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for the consideration that she has given to the amendments. Clearly, there is much agreement on the matter. There are still some areas about which we may wish to argue and agree or disagree at a later date. However, I welcome her undertaking to bring forward alternative amendments at a later stage and, in the light of that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 232, in page 29, line 8, at end add—
	<br><q><p>"(7)Before making any order under subsection (6) above, the Secretary of State shall prepare a draft of the scheme he proposes should be adopted.

	<li>No order such as is mentioned in subsection (6) above shall have effect until approved by each House of Parliament.".</li></ol></p></q>
The Minister made it clear that the Government intend to introduce a national framework rather than a national scheme. She also referred to the reserve powers under clause 33(6), which would, if utilised,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>559</span>
enable the Secretary of State to introduce a national scheme. She said that that might be decided in the light of experience, although she made the point that that would not be in the near term. It is possible that the present or a future Secretary of State might choose to use the powers under clause 33(6). If the amendment were not accepted, the Secretary of State could introduce a national assessment scheme, not unlike that introduced for assessment at key stages 1, 2 and 3, without appropriate scrutiny—parly or otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Using words familiar to us from section 314 of the Education Act 1996 and reminiscent of similar sections of the Education Reform Act 1988, the amendment would ensure that appropriate consultation took place on a draft national scheme and that that scheme could not be accepted until it had been agreed by both Houses of Parliament. That approach has been used for all assessment schemes that the Government have introduced heretofore, so it seems somewhat odd for any national scheme introduced under the reserve powers of clause 33(6) not to include a similar procedure. I moved the amendment because it would ensure consistency with all other national assessment schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bath may be surprised, but I support the principle behind the amendment in that it would ensure that the Secretary of State could not introduce a standard, national baseline assessment scheme until it received Parliament's full approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the development of baseline assessment, we have been and remain aware of the importance of consultation. SCAA consulted widely when drawing up its proposals. Its consultation document was sent to all schools, and there were more than 7,500 replies—an impressive response. Apart from consulting all known baseline assessment provides, LEAs, teacher associations, GM school associations, and nursery providers, SCAA has also held a series of conferences across the country which have been extremely well attended, and SCAA has even surveyed parents' views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I speak, SCAA is hosting a consultation conference in London to discuss the criteria. Officials from the Department are attending the conference, as they did at a similar event held in Birmingham last week. That is clear evidence of our commitment to consult to ensure that the arrangements draw on existing experience and that what we set in place will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power to prescribe a national scheme under clause 33(6) is a contingent one. It is a dormant provision, included in the Bill to enable the Secretary of State to introduce a single national scheme if that emerged as the preferred way forward in the light of experience. As I have said—the hon. Member for Bath was correct—it is not in our minds to invoke this measure in the near term. Before doing so, we should certainly want to consult as widely as we have done in the past.

[MR. HARTLEY BOOTH 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>560</span>
Welcome to the Chair, Mr Booth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have resisted the insertion of such a measure into primary legislation for three reasons, with which I shall deal in turn. First, it goes without saying that a draft would have to be prepared before the Secretary of State could introduce a single, national baseline assessment scheme. Secondly, I am content to give an undertaking to consult; I am not prepared to be required to do so by statute. Thirdly, section 68 of the Bill allows both Houses of Parliament to consider all orders and, therefore, there is no need for duplication in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we are at one on the principles behind the amendment, but formal enactment seems unnecessary and undesirable. I shall resist it, unless the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurances and withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for her reply. I assure her that there is a significant degree of agreement in the Committee about the broad principle of baseline assessment. I accept the hon. Lady's assurances, although I am a little surprised that she is not willing to accept the amendment in its present form, which is identical to that applied to all other national assessment schemes introduced by the Government. As there is likely to be a change of Government in the near future, circumstances may change in any case. Given the Minister's assurances and that likely future scenario, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 33(2) requires baseline assessment schemes to be accredited by the Qualifications and National Curriculum Authority in accordance with the criteria approved by the Secretary of State. The School Curriculum and Assessment Authority published the criteria immediately prior to the Christmas break and they contain the necessary bureaucratic procedures for accreditation, which will last initially for two years. There is no procedure for minor variations to the schemes, but given the rapid development of baseline assessment, the schemes will probably change from year to year. I urge the Minister to ensure that schemes are given broad approval and will last for three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 10 gives the main criteria and paragraph 11, referring to administration of the scheme, requires schemes to fulfil many purposes which, in their development, they may not be able to achieve. If, as in paragraph 13, only 20 minutes per child is allowed for assessment, baseline assessment schemes may never achieve the objectives set out in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the draft criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, there is an implication that schemes must be part of the identification procedures for special educational needs. That is unlikely to be achieved, as is the requirement that there must be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>561</span>
numerical outcomes. Schemes must collect background data on pupils and use that data along with the outcome of assessments for future value-added measurements. Schools and LEAs without prior experience of the work may find that a difficult task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Baseline assessment must take place within seven weeks after a child has started at primary school and the administration—including assessment—of the scheme must be no longer than 20 minutes per child. I know what the Minister said about consultation and in the spirit of that consultation, I hope that she will recognise that the time scales of seven weeks and 20 minutes are not realistic. I hope that the Minister will ensure that SCAA adopts a realistic approach to the introduction of baseline assessment, with which we all concur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause puts in place the necessary duties on governing bodies and LEAs to conduct baseline assessments under the proposed national framework. Early indications from SCAA's consultation on the idea of a national framework, which, as the hon. Member for Walton knows, finished on 8 November, are that it has been largely welcomed. The feedback from SCAA's report to the Secretary of State is not due until the beginning of next month, but I have heard what the hon. Member for Walton said and I shall bear his remarks in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

When I intervened in the Minister's speech to try to save time, she was talking about the baseline assessment scheme and about whether all children would be able to meet its procedures. The hon. Lady made it clear that she supported the idea of a national framework rather than a national scheme. That would mean that different schemes would operate in different parts of the country. It is, therefore, impossible for the Minister to assure the Committee that every child of appropriate age will be able to conform to the schemes' procedures. In certain circumstances—for example, with pupils for whom English is an additional language, or where there are severe special educational needs, or for whatever other reasons—some children will be unable to conform to the specific requirements of assessment. The Minister effectively recognised that, saying that many children with special educational needs would be able to. By implication, therefore, she recognises that some children will be unable to conform. However, this does not mean that they should not be encompassed within the baseline assessment; the hon. Lady and I agree about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>562</span>
My amendment would, in certain circumstances specified by the Secretary of State and operating under conditions set by the holder of that post, merely give, in extreme cases, power to vary a school's baseline assessment scheme. I hope that the hon. Lady will agree that it is sensible to allow that leeway in certain circumstances and that she will accept, in this or some alternative form, the broad principle of my proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Committee, I should like to say, Mr. Booth, that your firm chairmanship is noted by us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath will not be surprised by my comments on the amendment. I realise that its purpose is to enable schools to modify, if necessary, the baseline assessment for children who may have special educational needs or for whom English is an additional language. This is a laudable aim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[SIR MICHAEL SHERSBY 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>The School Curriculum and Assessment Authority is examining closely the way in which all assessment scheme providers should be required to provide instructions and guidance for schools, including giving advice as to the best way to plan for children who may have certain types of special educational needs; SCAA is also considering ways in which to assess the attainment of children for whom English or Welsh is an additional language.</p>
	<p>We all agree that children should be assessed on entry to school, both to inform their teachers and to provide numerical information that can be used for value-added analysis. If special needs or circumstances make baseline assessment inappropriate for a child, clause 34(4) allows the head teacher to exempt the child from assessment. The prime aim of baseline assessment is to identify where children are starting from; anything that achieves that is worthy of support.</p>

May I offer my rather belated congratulations to the Minister of State on his elevation to the Privy Council? Opposition Members have noticed the distinguished

company that he has had in his inexorable rise from the foothills of Government and it seems almost a shame that an election will get in the way of his progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can agree on the amendment as it would simply add the words "in literacy" to the clause. It would mean that schools should have annual targets not just for those matters laid out in subsection (1), but for literacy. As the hon. Member for Bath said earlier, the Minister's Department might need some literacy targets. Perhaps while the Minister was out of the Room he was scouring the files to find the letter; I am sure that he will tell us whether he did make those spelling mistakes, although he will probably claim that they were typing or computer errors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require schools to have specific literacy targets, which we believe to be important. We are trying to widen the clause very slightly, and I should like to say a few words in support of the amendment. I do not believe that any Committee member would disagree with the idea that literacy underpins all learning for children. Whether in reading, writing, speaking or listening, literacy underpins the success that children will enjoy in their education. That applies not only to the traditional reading of books and the many sorts of written material that children have to look at, but to modern techniques, such as reading computer screens and manuals—although children are usually far better than adults at that. High levels of literacy are required for all those activities, be they modern or traditional aspects of learning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Literacy impinges on children's ability to speak and to listen. It is sad that head teachers and governors are reporting that the level of skills of many children entering the education system has declined recently. Many children sit in front of the television for long periods and perhaps do not have the opportunity to discuss, talk and listen. That is not always the parents' fault; sometimes the circumstances in which people live drives them into isolation, so that their children are also somewhat isolated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably the hon. Gentleman will tell us how his party's dramatic and radical proposals for compulsory homework will reduce the amount of time that children spend in front of the television. Will he elaborate on his party's proposals for the inspectorate that it will no doubt have to appoint to inspect every household every evening to ensure that the homework is being done?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unusual for the Minister to try to draw me off at a tangent. I am sure that if I talked about our homework policy, willing though I am to expound on it at great length, you, Sir Michael, would quite rightly draw me back into order and to the amendment before us. However, if there is some future debate on those matters, my hon. Friends and I should be happy to discuss them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all seriousness, the Minister raised an important point, and I do not see why we should disagree on it. In some homes, it is difficult for children to do homework. In some cases—not all—that is the parents' fault. If one lives in a small, high-rise flat with other children around, it is difficult to provide the right environment in which to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Southway school in my constituency has today launched a new homework initiative. Children will be able to use school premises after school and some children are being supervised by older children. I applaud that type of initiative. Those children will be able to work in a warm, safe environment. They can use the school's facilities, including the library. That is an excellent way to provide the right conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some schools are also offering breakfast-time clubs where children can work before school. The Minister is always looking for clear blue water between us on homework, but there is less disagreement than he would like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend answer two questions? First, does he agree that the Labour party has constantly advocated the importance of homework? We have always proposed a network of out-of-school homework clubs such as the kind of thing the Prince of Wales backed yesterday. Kids' club networks are useful, in addition to the many existing examples of good practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, does my hon. Friend agree that, as usual, the Minister is being dragged reluctantly to the feast on these productive issues? Only today have we been given a document on schools' performance in extracurricular provision in which the Minister belatedly acknowledges the importance that the Government give to homework and extols the virtues of extending existing good practice. The Government have singularly failed to have an effective unit within the Department for Education and Employment that propagates that good practice in the way that we propose to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The Government have been drawn from tinkering around with systems, as even the Minister has admitted. He said that they had spent too long on systems and organisation and too little time on how to raise standards. The Labour party has considered that in recent months and years and has put forward proposals. Of course we are glad that the Government are adopting some of them. We look forward to a rethink of some of their dogma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Literacy is something in which parents can become especially involved with their children. The very early years in school, when the child can take books or other reading materials home, are the first stages in interaction between schools and parents. Literacy, and reading and writing skills, are among the skills that children learn first, perhaps with the help of their parents as well as of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 36 identifies the narrowness of the Government's view of assessing schools' achievements. The clause mentions annual targets for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>565</span>
public examinations, for national curriculum tests and for external examination. We have no difficulty with those, but they are a limited view of the targets of schools. For example, public examinations are largely taken for the first time at 16. It is right that each school should have its own targets and should assess its own progress in those areas. We do not disagree with that, but much happens before the age of 16; schools should have clear targets at an early stage. The same is true of national curriculum tests. Again, I do not argue that schools should not consider how they can improve in regard to those tests—of course they should. They should also consider how they can improve on the annual targets. We are saying that a school should not have year-on-year targets just for the school as a whole, but for individual pupils. If literacy targets are set for a school, they should also be set for individual pupils, particularly five to eight-year-olds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discussing achievements for schools, we sometimes forget achievements for individual children. Talking just about the aggregate or average school performance does not always help us focus on the central question of how we can improve the educational standards of particular children. We need not only tests that establish what a pupil has learned, such as external examinations and, to some extent, national curriculum tests—summative tests—but formative tests and assessment so that we can diagnose what work children should do in future. Good teachers in the best schools are already doing such work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would focus the attention of all parents, governors, teachers and the whole of our community on the need to improve literacy. I hope that, as on the previous amendments, the Minister will be generous and obliging enough to give the amendment further thought, if he cannot accept it. The matter is vitally important and one on which we can agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I agree with the thrust of the case made by the hon. Member for Devonport; there can be no dispute over the crucial importance of literacy skills and of measuring and setting targets for them. However, I have two reasons for resisting the amendment. First, it is unnecessary because the hon. Gentleman's objectives are already contained in the Bill; the reference to the national curriculum includes English, which includes or subsumes literacy skills. The hon. Gentleman wants to highlight literacy, but literacy skills are already covered by the wording in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister assist us by telling us what elements of listening and speaking skills are included in the early years national curriculum tests, and to what extent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that those skills are already adequately covered. If they were not, it is open to all of us to review that, bearing in mind our agreement with the teaching profession that there will be no further substantive alterations to the curriculum for some time. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that that cuts two ways, as such arrangements always do. I have never claimed that we have the last word on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>566</span>
curriculum or on testing; no one believes that that is so. Testing should and will be reviewed and improved, but I ask the hon. Gentleman to bear in mind that we are under that self-imposed restriction. I do not know whether he and his party wish to continue that guarantee to teachers, in the event of their having an influence over events, but at present, the unwritten agreement we have with the profession acts as a restriction on improving any weaknesses or shortcomings. We have to bear that very much in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The Opposition agree that there should be less turmoil and constant change, especially the sort of change that happened in the early 1990s, when a plan made one week was changed the next. I think that the Minister agrees with me that pupils and teachers know the damaging effect of such changes. There is no provision specifically to consider speaking and listening skills in national curriculum tests. That is a small, but very important, addition. The Minister said that the issue needed to be considered again; why does not he do so now and put it in the bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Simply to include the word "literacy" in the Bill would not necessarily have the effect that the hon. Gentleman suggest. I have already said that there is, and always will be, an ongoing assessment of all matters relating to the curriculum, assessment testing and so on. That is SCAA's job at present and will be the responsibility of the Qualifications and National Curriculum Authority if the Bill is enacted. It is not as if the work is not going on and simply to put a word in the Bill will not bring it about. In the same way, mandating every child by legislation to do a certain amount of homework will not necessarily mean that they do it. I offer that as helpful advice to Labour Members, lest they should think that that would be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the logic of the hon. Member for Devonport, the word "numeracy" should have been added to the list of specifics. I argue that numeracy is already included because mathematics is a core skill within the curriculum. But the danger is that if we used statute to emphasise, or express the importance of a point, the list would either be very long or it would be relatively meaningless because the inclusions are already in the curriculum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill as drafted more than adequately covers the hon. Gentleman's rightful concern with literacy. There is a danger that if literacy alone was specified and not numeracy, for example, people would say, "Hold on a minute. Are we suggesting that one is more important than the other?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assist the Minister. I said in my opening remarks that literacy underpinned all learning, including numeracy. Children cannot become fully numerate until they are literate. That is fundamental, almost axiomatic, to learning and that is why the word "literacy" should be in the Bill. We would not want numeracy to be included, partly because the national curriculum tests cover numeracy, almost in its entirety. The Minister admits that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>567</span>
speaking and listening skills are not included in those tests; that is why the overarching, all-embracing term literacy must be in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not include communication skills, too? I am becoming very tempted now; we could have a competitive game and say, "I can think of even more core skills that might be in the Bill," which, in the hon. Gentleman's analysis would automatically bring them about. I tell him, from bitter experience, that specifying something in a Bill does not necessarily mean that it will happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not always happen as intended, either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) rightly says, things do not always happen in the way that was intended. That apart, I have argued consistently that it is always tempting to try to put one's own favoured items in a Bill in the belief that that will secure or guarantee what one wants. As I said, that will not necessarily be so. What is worse, it sets in legislative concrete what one may want to change. The hon. Gentleman wanted to highlight literacy; that may be important today but tomorrow or next year we may, on reflection, want to add numeracy, communication or information technology skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee to resist the proposal, partly, as I argued, because it is unnecessary and partly because, in ways that the hon. Gentleman has not anticipated, it might be counterproductive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister really looked as if he was struggling—he looked like a man who had totally lost the argument but who was confident of winning the vote. He talked about communication skills, but what are those if not reading, writing, listening and speaking? Those skills are part of literacy and his argument was spurious. I can see him undergoing a quick mental process; I can see the slight panic in his eyes as he tries to think of something else that he could dream up to put in the Bill. He must know that literacy stands on its own as the most important—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says no. I shall happily give way to him to hear what else is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Numeracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I argued that point previously; to be numerate, children need first to be literate. We won that argument, but having lost first time round, the Minister has come back to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that we should not put such things in the Bill. The question then must be what we are doing here. The Minister said to the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth that laws that are made are not implemented. Why has not the Minister made sure that previous legislation is implemented? Why has not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>568</span>
the Department done something about it if the Minister thinks that those wicked schools and governors have totally ignored all the precious and wonderful things proposed in previous legislation? I agree with the Minister that parents have ignored previous legislation—such as on grant-maintained schools, where the majority of parents have totally ignored their new powers and the right to hold ballots for schools to become grant-maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am wholly and utterly unconvinced by the Minister's arguments, despite his recent elevation. I am not minded to press the amendment to a Division as the Committee can probably return to the subject later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 195, in page 30, leave out lines 41 to 46.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulated the Minister earlier on his elevation to the Privy Council, but I neglected to congratulate him on his tie. It is the nearest thing to a psychedelic experience that I shall have during the remaining sittings of the Committee. I hope that it has not loosened our reasoning today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party has always strongly promoted the use of target setting as a management tool to lever up standards in schools. However, we are slightly concerned that if annual targets are required to be published, the natural tendency will be to aim low rather than to set an ambitious goal. It would surely be the inclination of all salesmen, especially used-car salesmen—I think of the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Norris), who has all the skills and experience to go with the salesman's way of life—to keep their targets low if they were allowed to set their own. They could thus be assured of meeting those targets and receiving the appropriate bonus. Is not that what the Government propose in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would rather that target setting was promoted as an essential internal management tool than as a meaningless external performance measurement for parents. As we have said on other occasions, that sort of target setting will vary from school to school and from circumstance to circumstance. Comparability in that context will be less than meaningful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, rather than amend the Bill to remove the requirement that targets should be set—we have constantly advocated them; we do not wish to be hypocritical—we believe that it would be sufficient for the Secretary of State not to be given the power to publish such targets. Instead, it should be left to governing bodies to publish if they wish to do so, either in the annual report or by other means. Nevertheless, I hope that the publication of targets within the school context will be encouraged. Our fear is that targets will develop into another form of league table, which would be irrelevant and counterproductive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the hon. Gentleman's well-deserved reputation for terminological exactitude, I am tempted to take him up on the phrase that he repeated twice in his brief speech: that the Labour party has always supported target setting. I would not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>569</span>
have to go back too far in history to demonstrate that the Labour party—new or old— is a recent convert to such matters. If we went back two or three Labour education spokesmen ago, we could find ample evidence that the Labour party resisted almost any attempt to talk about targets, standards or the publication of anything at all in education. However, I shall not engage in that debate today because it is not strictly germane to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that many Labour local authorities have set their own performance targets for schools? The Leeds local education authority is one such example. I hope that local authorities will be consulted about target setting. Leeds local education authority has already been developing performance targets for schools and for individual groups of schools. Does not that show that the Labour party has commitments that have been put into practice? It is in favour of targeting in certain respects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we measured Labour party policy on the basis of what happens in Labour-controlled LEAs, we would find many interesting things emerging from the woodwork. The hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell), in taking civic pride—as he rightly does—in his own city may see the matter from that point of view, but sitting not far from him in Committee is the hon. Membe for Barking whose view might be different if we examined what went on in the authority with which she has been associated in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I advise the hon. Gentleman not to follow his argument too far. If he was allowed to be selective, he might get away with it. But if he is saying that we should judge Labour education policy on the basis of what happens in Labour-controlled LEAs, that could lead him in directions in which he does not really want to go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister accept that my hon.Friend the Member for Morley and Leeds, South was merely illustrating that we have argued constantly from the basis of best practice? That is different from the somewhat specious extrapolation that we are trying to hold up every authority as a paragon of virtue in all instances. That is not the case. It never has been the case nor will it be the case in our advocacy of higher standards within all schools within all authority areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy, as always, to join the hon. Gentleman in the constant search for higher standards. Whether we judge any particular party's national policies on the basis of what it does locally is perhaps a matter for another day. I suppose that we would all end up being selective. The hon. Gentleman would refer to authorities that he considered had done rather well in education and I might, inevitably for the purposes of party political debate, do the opposite. However, let us leave that matter behind us, Sir Michael, because I detect that you are already becoming somewhat tried and tested by the exchange—for which I apologise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>570</span>
I tend to agree with part of what the hon. Member for Walton said about targets. He identified the problem that is inherent in the concept of targets and targeting, which is something that we should openly acknowledge. People working in a target-setting environment must make a difficult decision: either to set the targets relatively low and make them relatively easy to achieve or to set them extremely high, and risk not achieving them and suffer the encomium that goes with that. Moreover, they could try to pitch the targets somewhere in the middle to lift their performance, but not to fall too short of it. I accept that that problem is inherent in the whole concept of targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would argue with the hon. Member for Walton whether publication has that effect. It is not necessarily true that the publication of targets would lead people to pitch them excessively low. Even if it did, would that matter that much? We all agree that the process of setting a target for improvement and seeking to achieve it is what we want. Even if publication were to lead some people to set targets a bit lower than they might otherwise do, that is not a fatal flaw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that setting targets is a means to an end, not an end in itself, and that the end is to raise standards? There is cross-party agreement on that. The real issue is whether publication in the form that it might take—national league tables—would serve that end. That would be to compare unlike situations, as the Minister implied when he said that targets would be set to cater for different contexts. I do not know whether targets in special schools, for example, would be compared to targets in other schools. We saw with other league tables that it is impossible to compare the situation in special schools with that in mainstream schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and here again, at the risk of breaking centuries of parliamentary practice and convention, we may agree—it is almost becoming embarrassing. Value added will at some stage—hopefully, quite soon—be introduced as a way of squaring that circle. I think that we all agree that, once we have reliable measures of educational value added which are reported, we will have gone a long way towards dealing with the sort of difficulties that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. The same argument, environment and ethos will apply to target setting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of publication, there may be a difference of view and of philosophy—I do not know. In the old days, our education system operated on the basis of keeping cards close to chest, saying as little as possible and, "If we do well, fine; if not, let's hope nobody notices." We have long since opened up education to the scrutiny of parents, in particular, and of taxpayers generally, to make it more accountable. In that spirit, it is perfectly consistent and desirable that something as important and inherent as target setting is also open to the public view, so that everybody knows what is going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us know the real aspirations of a particular school; let us look at them and judge them. There is nothing unreasonable about that. Were targets to be set in private, there would always be some suspicion,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>571</span>
rightly or wrongly—and it would probably be unjustified in most cases—that something was not quite right and that the process of target setting was not as it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I do not share the fear of suspicion of the hon. Member for Walton about proceeding as publicly as possible. That is a difference between us. His party has come some way—indeed, his party leader has said more than once that he welcomes more and more publication of what happens in education. In that spirit, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the Bill is reasonable and that his amendment is not. If not, I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish briefly to say that, again, in the spirit of openness and consensus, I agree that the secret garden of education has been well and truly opened to public scrutiny, and that that is quite right. We agree that the more information is made available to parents, the better; but it must be meaningful information presented in a valid form. We do not want a school's relative merits to be distorted by a league table of targets that does not compare like with like. That is the danger that we face under the Bill as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that I do not agree with what he is saying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Member for Bath does not agree with the Labour party on this matter, but I could go to Liberal Democrat Members and get Heinz 57 varieties of belief about what the Liberal party stands for on just about any subject under the sun. Nevertheless, there is increasing consensus between the Liberal Democrats and the Labour party in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the spirit of progress and harmony and in the hope that we shall return to the issue on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 219, in page 30, line 46, leave out from first 'in' to end line and insert

This amendment follows on from the previous one. Under the Bill, regulations can be made to require school targets and pupil performance to be published in a specified way. There is a clear danger that such requirements will be designed to make it easy to rank schools in league tables. If the clause were to be followed, it would cut across the different starting points that schools will have and the varying rates of progress that will be set by the governing bodies who define the content of the targets. We return to the salesman analogy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Ranking in league tables would define a school's external image, especially for admission purposes, but might do little to promote discussion of the school's performance within the school. The Minister and I agreed that the objective behind target setting is to jack up standards; it is not to provide public relations camouflage for schools to attract the children and parents that they see fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, publication in the governing body's annual report to parents will place a school's performance at the heart of the dialogue between parents, staff and governors over what the school is actually doing. We all know that annual meetings are not always the best attended events, although the report is often popular. Perhaps at meetings there is no obvious format for discussing the school's core business—mainly, the education of its pupils, unless there has been an inspection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Publication in the form that we propose would achieve two objectives, as well as ensuring against the worst consequences of league tables. It would place before parents the targets set by the governors and would raise the issue of whether they are set at the right level. Before Christmas, we dubbed the Minister as the Minister for consultation and I am sure that he would agree that this is one more-than-useful form of consultation that could take place, especially in the context of meaningful home-school partnerships. The amendment would give parents a clear idea of a pupil's performance and the circumstances of the school, which they and the staff are best placed to judge, given that they are intimately involved with the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, we are being pulled in two directions. The hon. Gentleman is concerned about league tables and all sorts of information and results in that form. We must acknowledge that as soon as information on education is in the public domain, albeit through the annual report, it is open to anyone to put it together in tabular force. For example, even if we were no longer to have nationally published performance tables for schools, local or national newspapers would always be free to put together in any form they chose the information that schools publish in their annual reports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell the Committee how a newspaper could tabulate 24,000 separate annual reports? How many people would have to be employed to sift through those reports and systematically grade performance targets? Does not the Minister agree that this is absurd?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may or may not be impossible. Certainly, it would be relatively easy to do just that on a local basis. It may be that a private undertaking could produce a market solution to what the hon. Gentleman thinks is so unlikely. I am saying that as soon as it is argued, as the hon. Gentleman has done, that something should be put in the school annual report so that it becomes in the public domain, it is possible for it to be put together with other information and compared. Whether that could be done on a local, regional or national basis, I do not know.

I resist the hon. Gentleman's amendment for the reason that I keep returning to, which is that to put in statute what will or must be included in an annual report runs the risk of a degree of inflexibility being introduced to the annual report, which would be highly undesirable. The Committee will be aware that there is always a problem in requiring schools to put more and more information in their prospectus on the one hand and in their annual report on the other. We are all tempted to say that we want more and more information to be provided by schools through those media. That is bad enough. We in the Department are constantly reviewing the information that we require of schools. My understanding is that that information should be cut down to the minimum although, interestingly, we find that parents and often teachers or others want to include more and more information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we start to require by statute that certain information should be made available, for example, in the annual report, there is a danger of being on a slippery slope. We will consult on this matter. I have no doubt that such information might end up in school annual reports, but I am reluctant to accept such a requirment in the Bill, as that would introduce inflexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that the clause must not be inflexible, but there seems to be an assumption that it is facile for school governors to set performance targets. It seems that each set of governors should set a target that is both challenging and meaningful in the context of their school and its pupils. To that extent, I can understand that, if we were to impose uniformity on the process, performance targets inappropriate for a particular school might be produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, given that we all accept that this process is designed to improve standards for all pupils, a broad understanding of what each school is trying to achieve should be set out. As my hon. Friend the Member for Walton has said, a certain framework could be imposed while making it clear that rigidity is not intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions should be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take one more moment? It is important that schools receive appropriate support to enable them to set their targets. I should like to know what help the Government will provide the governors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with everything that the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) has said, and I congratulate him on slipping it in as an intervention. He and the hon. Member for Walton are right, but I draw their attention to the fact that clause 36(1) states:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State may require by regulations".</p></q>
We are now consulting on such matters. I envisage that guidance will be available, but I do not underestimate the difficulty that many schools and governors will have going down this route. It is good that we all agree that the proposal is desirable—it is the right way forward. As Opposition Members have said, many
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>574</span>
schools set such targets, which shows that it is doable, but I am under no illusion—doing so will present a real challenge for many schools and governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not necessarily appropriate to introduce a mandate, stating that all schools will set targets in the annual report. That might happen, but it is important for us to retain a degree of flexibility at this early stage in the process. Therefore, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the Minister's comments, I am even more alarmed at the prospect of league tables and the way in which such information will be published. There is a failure to recognise that setting targets is an internal matter for schools to enable them to raise standards. There are other ways, which can and will be used to gauge the success, or otherwise, with which standards are being raised within schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Determining how school performance information should be published is fraught with danger, and the Opposition have real fears about it. The Government argue that they want flexibility, and I accept that up to a point. The Minister said that the Secretary of State might do this, that or the other, but there might not always be a Secretary of State of one political persuasion, as there has been for the past 18 years. From the Opposition's perspective, I hope that there will not be. We are true democrats and wish to ensure that we do not replace the dogma of one side with the dogma of another. This is a constructive amendment which should be included in the Bill. Therefore we shall move to vote on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 121, in page 30, line 46, at end insert
	<br><q><p>", including value-added comparisons showing the progress of pupils against their initial level of attainment on admission to the school."</p></q>
If the Government intend, as we fear, to publish targets on a league table basis, it is incumbent upon the Opposition to explore Minister's true intentions. The amendment would require publication of targets and performance to include, but not consist wholly of,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>575</span>
value-added results, which the Minister spoke of earlier. The amendment is, in a sense, a probing measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a growing consensus that accepts the benefits to pupils and schools of measuring progress by value-added criteria; it is merely a question of finding an effective way of doing it. Such criteria show pupils' progress against their initial attainment on entering school. As such they have worth both for diagnostic purposes for individual pupils and, generally, as a clearer measure of a school's improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would test the Government's intention in exercising powers specifically to prescribe the publication of targets and performances. Can the Minister say whether they will be used to incorporate value-added criteria within data? He made a brief allusion to this earlier; what is his current thinking about it? Does he have any views on the ages at which value-added criteria can be of most value?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a slight risk of the term "value added" becoming a sort of mantra that, if repeated often enough, becomes desirable. We agree that the concept is desirable and something for which to strive.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>576</span>
However, the direct answer to the hon. Gentleman is that his amendment is inappropriate now because I am not sure, first, that we have yet arrived at a widely agreed definition of "educational value added" or, secondly, whether the word, "pupils" in the amendment refers to individual pupils, class groups, age cohorts or whole schools. We certainly do not yet have the stability or continuity of reliable data on which to measure the term "value added".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said earlier that he was on the verge of announcing research into the best approach to "value added". When does he expect that to happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, I expect, will be shortly. I was speaking as we find things now. The short answer to the hon. Gentleman is that putting this requirement in the Bill at this stage would be inappropriate because, at least until we have answered questions about methodology and have a proven and established series of data on which to base "value added"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
