	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Kilfoyle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Walton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we suspended the Committee on Tuesday, I was explaining that the group of amendments established certain criteria that I believe the Government would find unarguable. Yet those same criteria pinpoint what is wrong with greater selection, and they cannot be achieved if selection is allowed to expand as set out in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall set out the criteria and explain what they mean in terms of the balance between choice and diversity. We must enhance choice as well as diversity for all ranges of ability, but that cannot be achieved by more selection. Instead, the Bill will lead to large-scale selection and grammar schools by stealth through several routes. I refer first to the freedom to select up to the percentage limits under schedule 1, which covers the county and voluntary schools, and under clause 4, which covers the grant-maintained sector. The pressure of the domino effect once selection is encouraged on the scale proposed will be for schools to move to the maximum to preserve their competitive position. The local authority in the Minister's intended parliamentary seat of Bromley is a fine example of what happens as a result of a domino effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the grant-maintained sector, the conjunction of increased selection of freedom to expand numbers every four years by up to 50 per cent. will mean that the overall number of grant-maintained selection places will increase substantially.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way at such an early stage in his remarks. Will he be arguing that there is such a widespread demand for selection that many schools will want to take up the opportunities provided by the Bill and that the results that he is outlining will be widespread, or will he be arguing that there is so little demand for selection that it is insignificant and negligible? Can he clarify his argument for the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall attempt to clarify that at this early stage. I shall be arguing that there is not a great demand for selection. Evidence from individual schools shows that they are not greatly enamoured of selection. Nevertheless, the circumstances that will arise out of the Bill will force those schools down the route of selection to enable them to have a range of ability. If the Minister will bear with me, I shall explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under paragraph 3(2) of schedule 1, county and voluntary sectors will be able to select for all age groups in the school with their percentage limit—not just to move to, or expand, selection for the admission year group. County schools that wish to move to 100 per cent. selection and become grammar schools will be able to appeal to the Secretary of State over the heads of members of the local education authority, under what is a biased procedure in paragraph (5) of schedule 1. That favours the would-be grammar school over the interests of the community as a whole.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
A system of 100 per cent. selection for sixth forms—admittedly, that is frequently practised now—will become the statutory norm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The direction set by the Bill is wholly against retaining choice for the majority of parents; for most children, selection will not lead to a place. The reality is that the parents of children who fail to be selected will have less choice, if any, and those children are likely to face longer travelling times to schools further away than the preferred school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend as mystified as I was by the Minister's intervention? During the previous sitting, the Minister said that the Bill was permissive. If the Government has it in mind that more schools should be selective, why should they say that it is permissive? Why did they decide that schools should become selective? On the other hand, if they did not expect schools to take up the offer, why are we all sitting here?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why are we sitting here?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are sitting here to show the Minister and Conservative Members that their either/or option is not necessarily the only option. That decision seems to reflect the extremism on the Government Benches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite astonishing that Conservative Members should imply from a sedentary position that the question of whether we move away from the consensus of comprehensive education is trivial. If that is the case, why have the Government brought forward the legislation? The chair of the Conservative Education Association stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is profoundly dishonest to pretend that in the selective system there are only winners. If a GM school creams off the brightest and rejects the difficult pupils, that impacts negatively on every other school in the area. It is not acceptable to return to a system that gives advantage to the few at the expense of the many."</p></blockquote>
Does not my hon. Friend agree with Demitri Coryton's statement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh no, not him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says, from a sedentary position, "Oh no, not him." That man fronts an organisation known as the Conservative Education Association. Conservative Members should stop and think for a moment that widening a diversity of does not necessarily mean a widening of choice. It may for some, but not for many.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was speaking about the difficulties faced by children who, because of increased selection, will find that their local choice is circumscribed, which will involve their travelling ever further to school. That, of course, will be further cost to public funds, will waste pupils' and parents' time and will put the safety and well-being of pupils with long journeys at risk. None of those matters seems to have been considered by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
Government in their undue haste to put clear blue political water between them and the Opposition before the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat my contention that parts Ito IV of the Bill have no relation whatever to educational needs. In the fullness of time, we shall explore exactly why that is and the damage that will be caused to children's interests by the proposals. The reintroduction of the 11-plus exam would be widely opposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been following the hon. Gentleman's argument, but he is wrong. The reintroduction of selection would not be widely opposed, as he suggests. There are grammar schools in my constituency, and I assure the hon. Gentleman that they are not widely opposed but welcomed. I also listened with interest to the intervention of the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) who mentioned permissiveness. Does the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle), truly not understand that the Bill is permissive and that we are giving people greater choice? We do not believe, as does the hon. Lady, that only comprehensive education is right. We want choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly not permissive when the odds are stacked in one direction, which is precisely what the Bill will achieve. I accept that choice will be extended. I shall give a positive example of that later, but I shall attempt to show that many people will be denied choice because the notion of selection will be extended under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vast majority of parents, if asked, would say that they want their children to have the best education. We would all say that. Parents are told that, because of the way the numbers pan out, every time there is a winner, there is a loser and their children might be the losers, but the last thing they want is for their children to end up in sink schools which no one wants to go to. However, many children, for many reasons, end up in such schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not like the use of the phrase "sink school", but I know what the hon. Gentleman means. Will he not accept that there are sink schools and that they are run by Labour authorities? That is the essence of the matter. Does he not remember that, when we last met, I said that freedom to move between types of schools is the essence of selective eduction. Flexibility is the essence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that flexibility is the essence. The question is whether the Bill offers flexibility for some at the expense of many. The Bill will deny many children flexibility. They will be condemned to sink schools—a phrase that the hon. Gentleman does not like to hear, but we must describe those schools as such because that is what they are. The Ridings school is a classic example. The hon. Gentleman readily attacks Labour local authorities, but a Conservative local authority amalgamated two schools to form the Ridings school. I am not attacking what that authority did, but I am saying that it is simplistic to point a finger at local education authorities which have been forced down particular roads. Of course, both Labour and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
Conservative authorities can make mistakes, but to deny schools such as the Ridings exist and that, after 17 years, central Government bear no responsibility for that fact is to fly in the face of reality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is so critical of children having opportunities to improve their chances—he is against selection—will he clarify what the Labour party's policies really mean? Would his party end all selection and drag everyone down to the lowest common denominator?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me put it on record that we are not against children's educational opportunities—quite the reverse is true. We have said repeatedly that we want the same opportunities to be offered to all, not to a favoured minority. That is why we want the money that is spent on the assisted places scheme to be used to the advantage of all children at key stage 1, rather than for the 35,000 or 36,000 children who receive preferential education in the independent sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gravesham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Lady Olga Maitland) asked an extremely relevant question. Will the hon. Gentleman answer it with a clear yes or no? If there were to be a Labour Government, would they remove the present financial freedoms and scrap grammar schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will contain himself, he will hear the answer. I was answering the first part of the hon. Lady's question and I would have answered the second part unequivocally. We have said that we will ballot all those parents who have an interest in a school's admission policy so that they can decide locally what should happen. I hope—this is a personal view—that all of those ballots will be for the removal of selection in those grammar schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arnold</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman make it absolutely clear which parents would be balloted? Would the parents of children who attend grammar schools be balloted—if not, which parents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All those children who have a legitimate aspiration to go to any particular school will be involved. If a school has traditional feeder schools and draws from a whole authority, it would be reasonable for any parents within that authority area who aspired to send their children to that school to participate in the ballot. That is not novel. We have said repeatedly that that will be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend surmise what choice children in Rugby and Kenilworth have if they fail the 11-plus and have to go to secondary moderns?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer lies in the question. In those circumstances, the schools choose the children; children do not have a choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman reads my mind. I suggest that the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) look at the results for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
Warwickshire; that provides the answer to his question. Labour Members do not take on board the fact that the discipline of the 11-plus applies to primary schools, so our primary schools are much better than those in areas that do not have selective education. The rigour of the 11-plus is felt throughout the whole secondary range. I do not talk about high schools in the disparaging way that the hon. Member for Walton does; our high schools do a splendid job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come back to flexibility. In Rugby, we can move children from a high school to a grammar school or vice versa. That is the essence of flexibility, which is the point that I have tried to impress on the hon. Member for Walton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to pre-empt debate on the next set of amendments, which deal with primary selection, but it seems that Conservative Members want to push the point of selection ever further down the chronological scale. It will not be long before a child's educational opportunity is determined at the age of five or even before that. For many people, of course—and Conservative Members are experts on this—that opportunity is determined at the date of birth, as parents buy themselves into a system that is outside the maintained sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Jacques Arnold</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman please clarify his earlier point? He said that there should be a widespread ballot on the future of grammar schools in what he would call catchment areas. Which budget will pay the costs of such a ballot? Would it be the grammar school's, the education authority's or someone else's?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could be a useful function of the Funding Agency for Schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But Labour will abolish it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall certainly abolish the quango that runs the FAS, but I would be happy for a Labour Government to avail themselves of the body of experience in the FAS and to use the funds that the outgoing Government will no doubt allocate to the FAS for other purposes. Of course, there will not be GM status under a Labour Government, but there will still be a budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill threatens to reintroduce the 11-plus in many areas by the back door. On Second Reading, we said that if the Government had the courage of their political convictions, the would stand up and say, "It is our intention to bring back the 11-plus for everyone", but they are bringing it in by the back door. That will happen in a disaggregated way, driven not by decisions made by public bodies that can be held to account, but by the actions of individual school governing bodies, which may act alone without reference to the local education authority, voluntary authorities or even, in some cases, the Secretary of State, and which will respond within the terms of their narrow remit to pressure from a market system.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
The section of the Bill dealing with selection was preceded by chapter 4 of the White Paper, which is detailed, but less than honest. The headline of the Department for Education and Employment press release announcing the White Paper read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"More Freedom for Schools, More Choice for Parents".</p></blockquote>
On 25 June, the launch day for the White Paper, the Secretary of State was perhaps more honest when she wrote in 	<i>The Times</i> that the Government wished to
	<br><blockquote><p>"encourage diversity and choice by a variety of measures to enable all schools to select a greater proportion of their pupils".</p></blockquote>
Therein lies a tale: it is about schools having choice, not parents and children having a choice, and chapter I of the Bill is about schools choosing pupils, not parents choosing schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chapter of the White Paper devoted to selection is entitled "Choice, Diversity and Specialisation". After the ritual homily about the drift towards uniformity in the 1960s and 1970s—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not know whether it is play hour for some Conservative Members of the Committee; they are obviously in need of some remedial education and have slipped down the age ladder.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the Committee that it is out of order to receive communications by mobile telephone instruments in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly out of order for a grown Member of the Government to be listening to "Children's Hour".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the chapter of the White Paper devoted to selection is entitled "Choice, Diversity and Specialisation".—[	<i>Interruption.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As I said, this is an important debate on a subject about which Members on both sides of the Committee feel strongly. We should set a good example to schools throughout the country by debating it in a manner appropriate to Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying a moment ago, the White Paper delivers the ritual homily about the drift towards uniformity in the 1960s and 1970s—those much maligned decades—and the usual ritual attack on comprehensive schools, which were, and often still are, introduced, supported and encouraged by local authorities of all political persuasions. There follows a list of the choice and diversity initiatives introduced since 1981: the assisted places scheme, designed to subsidise schools—certainly not to subsidise pupils—city technology colleges, technology and language colleges, grant-maintained schools and now independent promoters of grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document then states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it can be difficult, at least at secondary level, for any single school to respond effectively to the full range of educational needs in the local community."</p></blockquote>
I disagree strongly with that; the increase in standards over the past 30 or so years—for which there is lots of statistical evidence—has been brought about mainly by the comprehensive school system. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
comprehensive schools have since their inception been the standard bearers of the improvement in educational standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Government would agree that parts I and II of the Bill are designed to encourage new grammar schools, to provide greater freedom for schools to select pupils, to encourage grant-maintained schools and to develop the specialist schools programme. We should concentrate for a few moments on the devastating effect of the Bill's selection proposals. The Government envisage the following broad categories of selection: for grammar schools, 100 per cent., for GM schools, 50 per cent., for GM specialist schools, 50 per cent., for local education authority specialist schools, 30 per cent., and for other LEA schools, 20 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take a hypothetical example of an English metropolitan district—we could call it Bromley, but that exists, so let us call it Erewhon—and consider how it might appear five years after the Bill's enactment. For the sake of simplicity, let us assume that there are a total of 20 secondary schools: four of the new grammar schools, four grant-maintained selective schools, four grant-maintained specialist schools, four local education authority specialist schools and four local education authority comprehensives each selecting the maximum allowable number of pupils. Under the domino effect to which I referred earlier, which occurred in Bromley, in order to maintain a range of abiltiy, even schools reluctant to go down the selective path would do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the hypothetical choice within such diversity. In my mythical example, all the schools choose to select the maximum percentage allowed under the Bill, and the four new grammar schools are a mixture of new schools—albeit in buildings previously used by LEA schools—and ex-independent schools. Again, to make things simpler let us assume that there are no single-sex or denominational schools, no city technological colleges and no account taken—unlike the situation in Bromley—of imports from surrounding LEAs. Such a place would represent the Government's ideal. There is a choice of grammar and selective schools, specialist schools for music, sports, technology and language which select by aptitude, and all the LEA schools have a grammar stream. A total of 50 per cent. of the places are available for pupils in the borough of high ability or with a particular aptitude. There are twice the number of grammar places available than there were in the good old days before the introduction of comprehensives. It would be a large-scale magnification of the grammar system, even compared with the halcyon days of the 1940s and 1950s when the 11-plus was de rigueur for everyone of appropriate age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that there was no difficulty in travelling to any part of the borough and let us consider the experiences of two children, a girl and a boy, put forward by their parents for selection—later I shall give the example of an LEA I have visited that illustrates what happens in such a situation. One of the children is a girl who is well above average, a good all-rounder; she has had music lesons and is a grade 6 cello

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
player in the local school orchestra. The family visit France regularly and she is fairly fluent in French—and prepared to speak it. Her mother is a medical secretary for the local NHS trust and her father a director of a local facilities management company. She has one younger sister. That paints a picture of a particular type of young person from a particular background—typically middle England, I suppose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The boy is the middle child of five; he has two brothers and two sisters. From an early age he has had extra help with reading at his primary school and is now just about up to his chronological reading age. He is quite a diffident boy who is not often noticed; his passion is football—as it is for many Members of the Committee, including the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs)—and he goes to all the local football matches with his father when he is not at work. His mum works in a local factory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is odds on that those two children live in different parts of town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the first schools in this mythical town went grant-maintained, there were many unfilled places in secondary schools and fierce competition for pupils. Although there is now, in that hypothetical situation, an exact match between the number of places and the number of 11-year-olds, the schools fail to agree on common admissions policies or even common dates for examinations. The secondary heads agree not to start the selection procedure before the end of September, although a couple of schools start to send invitations to prospective parents to such events as sports days and school plays so that they can get a feel for the school ethos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parents of the young lady get the brochures for all the schools—from a local citizens advice bureau, for example—and they are sufficiently au fait with the modern educational world to have kept the article on league tables from a local paper, so they know where schools stand comparatively in terms of GCSE results and so on. They would have liked to have waited until the results of the previous academic year are published in November, but they realise that the places will be gone by then, so they fill in separate application forms for 10 schools, as well as the general application form for the ordinary LEA schools. They apply to four grammar schools, four grant-maintained selective schools, two specialist language schools and two specialist music schools, which are all available in that LEA. That is quite a task because each of those applications has to be tailored to meet the demands of the individual school; the parents have to emphasis what they think are the most telling points about the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The autumn term arrives and the parents have a real trial. There are test papers for the grammar and selective schools, although, fortunately, the tests themselves are taken in the primary schools, but given the pressures of selection hanging over the child, she might not perform as well as she would otherwise have done. There will then be interviews with head teachers and admission teachers, and schools to be visited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, by Christmas, the family think that it has all been worthwhile because the child is offered a place at three of the new grammar schools, three of the new GM schools and three out of four of the specialist schools. The one that she misses out on is the Carter USM music school, which apparently does not cater for cello—the parents misunderstood what the name implied. However, after visiting the various academies and schools that have offered a place, the child accepts the offer at a grammar school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the other poor kid? The parents are a bit worried about the boy because of his difficulty with reading. He is struggling to keep up with his chronological age, but he is just about managing it, and he has a thing about sport. The parents apply to a couple of sports specialist schools in the local education authority and the boy has a trial at one of them, but ends up 18th on the waiting list. However, the local comprehensive to which his father has gone readily accepts him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That underlines the reality of the Governments proposals and what will happen to two quite different young children on reaching the age of 11. If anyone doubts the plausibility of my remarks and the complexity of the problem, I advise hon. Members to visit Watford, as I did last year, where I met the fathers of two cousins. If memory serves me correctly, there were six or seven GM secondary schools and two LEA schools in Watford at that time, so, the parents made seven or eight applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the fathers said that his child had been accepted at every school to which he had applied, so he had a choice. However, the child's cousin was rejected on every application. One child had a choice among all the schools available, while the other was denied any choice at all. That child's father had to go through an appeals mechanism for each of his applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is bizarre to waste taxpayers' money and teachers' time in that way. The parents suffer emotional frustration and the poor child is like a tennis ball, being knocked around all over the place. The child does not know which school he will go to, whether he will be with his friends or whether he will be able to achieve his aspirations. That is the reality of the Governments proposals. To talk of choice in those circumstances is a highly selective definition of the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to four criteria earlier, the first being that we all hope to enhance choice and diversity for ranges of ability. I am sure that the Minister will say that that is what the Government hope to achieve, but we would argue that the Bill will not do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second criterion is that there should be no loss of resources to the local education authority. We should enable resources to be better targeted, but that will not be achieved by the Bill. Selection will drive up costs and LEAs will face the increased cost of moving pupils greater distances and the cost of a more complex admissions procedure and appeals system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cite the example of Durham county council which estimates that additional costs in the first year of increased selection will be £0.4 million, rising over time to £8 million. Extrapolating national figures from an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
admittedly restricted local figure would produce immediate increases of £30 million in England in the first year and £2 million in Wales. It might increase at the same rate as the figures projected for Durham county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We contend that those figures illustrate a problem—one that the Government are ignoring. Costs are likely to rise, but the Government have made no provision for that increase. The financial and explanatory memorandum states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The provisions on pupil selection (clauses 1 to 4) are unlikely to have any significant financial effect."</p></blockquote>
That is certainly not the view of the local education authorities. On what basis was that statement made? Will the Minister undertake to review matters if evidence proves to the contrary? We believe that not to do so would mean resources being diverted from the classroom to other areas. Parents would be gravely concerned about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Out of humanity, and to allow the hon. Gentleman to rest for a moment, I suggest that if he compares the current profiles of those authorities that have a relatively high degree of selection and those that do not, he will find that the expenditure per pupil is significantly lower in the former than in the latter. I give two entirely random examples. Southwark spends a lot of money per pupil with pretty lousy results; it is the sort of authority of which the hon. Gentleman would doubtless approve. The other authority, Bromley, already been mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, has schools such as St. Olave's. The hon. Gentleman will find that less money is spent per pupil in generally selective areas than in the areas of which he would approve. That probably answers the point that he is trying to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I am trying to make is that the proposals would incur extra expenditure. That view is shared by the local education authorities. It is a specious digression to talk about what is happening in Bromley or Southwark, given the different circumstances that obtain in those boroughs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's intervention was utterly extraordinary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Go back to Islington.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let us have some order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Government do not understand the impact of socio-economic grouping on the schooling of children, they are not fit to be in charge of our nation's education. We should be trying to ensure that all children, whatever their background, are given the facilities to improve the outcome of their education. If the Minister does not understand that a case can be made for spending rather more money where people come from less advantaged backgrounds, it demonstrates his complete lack of understanding on how to run an education system to ensure equality of opportunity for all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely correct. It shows that Conservative Members are very much concerned to score cheap political points rather than address the major issues implicit in this part of the Bill, namely that selection will not only obviate much choice and cost more, but that no provision has been made for those costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is rare that I look to find common ground with the Opposition, but I might almost have been able to agree with the hon. Gentleman if he were to accept that the socioeconomic factors referred to were relevant. For instance, if the Leader of the Opposition had kept his child in Islington the socio-economic balance in Islington would undoubtedly have improved. Is not the reality that in Labour areas such as Islington, people are trying to send their children to schools outside the area? Is not that the Labour party's problem, in that it has no credibility on the issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it would be a marvellous example to the nation if, like my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, members of the Government put their children in the maintained school system, rather than overwhelmingly placing them in the independent sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From a sedentary position, the Minister says that they do. Will he give us the respective percentages for members of the Government who send their children to independent schools and those who send them to schools in the maintained sector?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As one who sent his children to schools in the maintained sector—and I know that my hon. Friend the Minister sent his daughters to schools in the maintained sector—I ask the hon. Gentleman to confirm that more than 10 per cent. of Islington parents opt out of using local authority schools. Given the reputation of the Islington social services department, that may not be surprising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a bit confused as to why the social services department should have an impact on parents' choice for their children's education. London has had a different education tradition from that in the rest of the country. I understand that it has always been the case that Londoners, for sound geographical reasons, have regularly sent their children across large distances within the London conurbation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Resources should be used more effectively in our schools, which would be the case if local education authorities provided school places nearer to home; that would be more efficient and more convenient for children. It would be of great benefit to children to be educated nearer to home, rather than to be increasingly driven further away, which will be one of the results of the proposals on selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third criterion on which I hope the Government will agree with us is that we should enhance provision for pupils with special needs. I do not believe that,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0129">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
under the selection proposals, that will continue to happen. Instead, we shall move in precisely the opposite direction and undo the progress made in recent years towards integration and, ultimately, fully inclusive education where appropriate, a policy that has been enshrined in successful legislation and in the special needs code of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the admissions stage, pressure to demonstrate higher academic achievement driven by selection and, in turn, driving selection—another ratchet—cannot but impose further pressure on popular schools to reduce the number of admissions of pupils who have or are likely to have special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the school life of the child, the increased trend in separation and the narrowing of the ability range in such schools will reduce teachers' expectations of non-selection pupils and remove valuable role models from those schools. The Government have offered no evidence on the impact of greater selection on pupils with behavioural difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention was made of the Ridings school. The ethos and self-image of less popular schools is affected by the enhanced attention to selection and the results of that cannot but signal a narrowing focus, which is likely to reduce opportunities for children with special needs. I know that the Minister has a great interest in the matter, so I look forward to hearing his response, particularly on how special needs provision will be affected by selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth criterion on which we hope that the Government will agree is that we need to promote the educational opportunities for all pupils in a given area and its neighbouring areas. We do not believe that selection can meet that criterion. Resources—and attention and a sense of achievement—must necessarily attach to the more academically able. When a school increases the proportion of pupils selected, that may, depending on its location, affect not only other schools in the authority's area, but some in neighbouring authority areas. The effects on voluntary-aided schools may be even more widespread and disturb the pattern of admissions over a considerable catchment area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for all those reasons that we want to amend the Bill. We are opposing selection not for its own sake—although I do personally—but because of the damage that it inflicts on children who do not have the same opportunities either to be selected or to exercise any choice themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Committee if I speak now, not, I hope, at the length at which the hon. Gentleman did, but to set out briefly the rationale behind the matters to which he referred under the rubric of the amendment. It is worth recalling that under existing legislation, the admission authorities of both local education authority and grant-maintained schools may introduce or extend selection without going through a lengthy approval process only if that does not amount to a significant change in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
character of a school. At present, questions about whether particular changes are significant are settled by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We published a circular in June this year saying that, in general, selection of up to 15 per cent. of a school's intake is not likely to amount to a significant change of character, but that anything else must go through the approval process. Therefore, that 15 per cent. is already, as it were, in the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Opposition Members said, however, the Bill will change that process in several ways. We are dealing with the preliminary stages of the change under clause 1, schedule 1 and clause 4, in particular, which will give admission authorities more freedom to change the proportion of pupils admitted by selection, without necessarily going through the present complicated and cumbersome statutory route. That will be done by the setting the thresholds to which the hon. Member for Walton referred, so that an authority school, a grant-maintained primary school or the few GM secondary schools which, as a result of Ofsted inspection, are found to be failing and under the Bill require special measures, would take the 20 per cent. threshold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talked about the cumbersome statutory route. Does he believe that local accountability and the consideration of local opinions can be dismissed airily as being cumbersome?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because consultation is an inherent part of the new process. The Bill requires that appropriate consultation is undertaken at local level. We want to cut out the bureaucracy and the heavy hand of either the LEA or, dare I say it—and I hope that she is not listening—the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was pleased to hear the Minister's remarks, but they are not reflected in the Bill. If he means what he says, would not he accept amendment No. 55, under which no change can be made until there has been appropriate consultation? Our proposal would write into the Bill the consultation process which the hon. Gentleman said that he supports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is inherent in the Bill that consultation is required. In fact, we shall almost certainly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us get through one question at a time. We envisage—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Does the hon. Gentleman want to hear my reply or not? I shall sit down before I reply to the hon. Member for Walton if the hon. Gentleman wants to ask another question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We envisage going as far as to issue guidelines on the form that that consultation might take. But subsequent amendments cover the matter and we shall deal with them at the appropriate time. I give way to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) who is now showing some patience and restraint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way. Will he confirm that while he used the word "appropriate" in regard to consultation, in the Bill the appropriateness of consultation is determined by the individual school and no one else?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0130">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. That is a point of difference between us. We are following the principles of local accountability and local determination while Opposition Members are obsessed with the power of LEAs—and I can understand why, from their point of view. Conservatives want to breadk that LEA monopoly, in the hope of challenging the unacceptable mediocrity and failure of the eudcation that so many LEAs deliver in so many parts of the country. For that reason, we propose to leave the responsibility with the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that neighbouring schools to those choosing whether to have more selection will also be affected by that choice yet will have no right to be consulted under the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us wait and see what emerges in the consultation process. It is not unlikely that such a proposal will be made and accepted, if the hon. Gentlemen will only be patient and wait to see how events unfold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister feels that there should be consultation—and that does not just involve the more controversial issue of LEAs, which we can set aside for the moment; there can be consultation with parents and governing bodies of feeder schools—will he explain where in the Bill such consultation is proposed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about the issuing of guidelines on consultation. If we have misunderstood the Government's intentions in regard to consultation, will the Minister lay those draft guidelines before the Committee so that we know to what he is referring? The Opposition believe that the lack of consultation on changing admissions procedures into schools is a key issue and one which makes us angry about the proposed changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The overall answer for now—we shall return to the issue later—is no. However, I shall not leave it at that; the hon. Lady probably deserves a little more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see any virtue in placing such detailed requirements on the face of the Bill because it sets in concrete measures that should be more flexible to changes in events. Hon. Members who have had the delight of sitting on Committees with me will probably recall my having said that repeatedly; it is one of the things about which I am relatively consistent. The Government believe that we would be much happier—and if Opposition Members reflected on it they would agree that they also would be much happier—if we introduced measures through regulations or, even better, through guidelines that can be treated more flexibly. Where appropriate—it will arise at several stages in our proceedings—the Secretary of State will doubtless issue guidelines; in some cases the legislation may require schools, for example, to have regard to such guidelines, but I shall resist attempts to put such detail on the face of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister has confirmed that he is not really concerned about consultation with people and their local representatives about proposals that directly affect them. He referred to the mediocrity of local authorities; given that just over 1,100 schools have opted for grant-maintained status, does he believe that the other 23,000 schools have been duped into accepting mediocrity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but many schools throughout the country that wanted grant-maintained status were mercilessly bullied into not doing so by LEAs in some disgraceful episodes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that the three grant-maintained schools in my constituency of Sutton and Cheam had to fight for their lives against obstacles placed in their way by Liberal Democrats who were trying to frustrate parents' attempts at real democracy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is another point of difference between the Government and the Opposition. I see no reason why we should conceal those differences. If Opposition Members seriously believe that local education authorities have never used their power and influence over parents, teachers, heads and governors when schools have wanted to follow the grant-maintained route, I feel sorry for them because such episodes are well known and well documented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to comment on the allegations that the Minister is making. However, he should be more specific and name such instances. I wish that his colleagues in the Welsh Office were here today, taking part in the debate. In a recent vote on grant-maintained status for a school in Carmarthenshire, the head teacher, who was for grant-maintained status, rang parents during the school day. Some of those parents gave their numbers to the school ex-directory for use only in emergency, but the head teacher abused that trust to persuade parents to vote for grant-maintained status. The Welsh Office refused to condemn that, but I hope that the Minister will do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly why there are proposals in the Bill to have observers for ballots on grant-maintained status. The observers will to try to ensure that abuses of the process, however they might arise, do not occur. I hope that Opposition Members will welcome those proposals. I welcome the fact that there is some common ground about those proposals, which we shall come to later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding the Minister's unsubstantiated, scatter-gun comments about local authority intimidation of aspiring grant-maintained schools, will he tell us how many complaints the Secretary of State has upheld about those ballots that have gone positively—from the Government's point of view—for grant-maintained status, but about which there have been allegations of interference from outside bodies, head teachers or school governers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the answer offhand but, no doubt, I shall be able to produce it at the appropriate point. Let us not become too hung up on that, shall we? There are echoes of previous occasions on which Opposition Members have not been able to decide whether they are appalled that large number of schools have become grant maintained or whether they believe that so few schools have done so that there is no problem. The selection argument is similar; Opposition Members cannot decide whether they are worried that there is sufficient groundswell of support to make the selection principle a significant factor on the education scene or whether they think that there is so little demand for it that it is not at all significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I used to say about grant-maintained status, I am relaxed about that matter. Under successive Acts, we have given choice to schools, parents and communities. Opposition Members hate that idea and they always resist it. Our view is that we allow people to choose what is appropriate for them in their local community. I do not mind how many people make that choice. I have always said that grant-maintained status will find its own level if we can level the playing field, and I say the same about selection. Whatever will be, will be. It will be the outcome of a natural process, springing from ground level in communities and schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the important matter is how parents react when schools become grant maintained? He will be aware that, before it was grant maintained, Hendon school in my constituency had about 160 applicants and that it now has 460, according to a recent parliamentary answer. Does that not show that parents welcome this change? Is it not a fact that truancy rates at grant-maintained schools are significantly lower than in other schools? Is that not good for the future of this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has illustrated an important point. It is obvious to us, but it is worth repeating for Opposition Members, that where support has been demonstrated for grant-maintained status and when schools have taken advantage of the freedom that that status gives, they become beacons of excellence. Surely, everyone in the education world would welcome that—perhaps, in their quieter moments, even some Opposition Members do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am genuinely interested—if the Minister can sustain the argument—in why the Government have changed their view on the value of selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of such a change of view. To give the hon. Lady a little bit of history, while I have been at the Department—a mere four years and some months—and, I suspect, before that, we have always
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
taken the view that under the existing, somewhat cumbersome procedures, schools are free to approach the Department with a case for becoming selective. We have always said that such approaches will be considered on their merits and granted or not granted accordingly. The Bill is a logical extension of that process. We are now saying that we would like to free up the process, to make it less bureaucratic and to allow schools that much more freedom to respond to local demand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has always been the practice of the Minister's predecessors to predict the number of schools that will apply for grant-maintained status. Will he during our proceedings be predicting the number of schools that will choose the selection route and use the provisions of the Bill? If so, will he share his prediction with us now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: the hon. Lady is being uncharacteristically mishchievous today; she knows that I never fell into that trap when we were considering the Education Act 1993. Some of my colleagues may at the time have been tempted to make predictions or set targets for grant-maintained schools; she may recall that I never was, for the reasons that I gave a moment ago. I am relaxed about how many sclools become grant-maintained, because that is a function of local demand. I am equally relaxed about how many schools will want to avail themselves of the freedoms that the Bill will give them. Where they choose to do that, I will be happy about it; where they do not, I will acknowledge it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The notion of collective responsibility seems to have entirely disappeared from the Government—not only in relation to caning. It is clear that the Prime Minister predicted a grammar school in every town. How does that square with what the Minister has just said—that he would not care two hoots whether schools become selective?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wondered whether that might come up; my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister did no such thing. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] No, he did not. I have had the facts checked and have with me somewhere the press cuttings—with which I will not bore the Committee—from which that story emanated. My right hon. Friend said no such thing. It was attributed to Downing Street that it was anticipated that there might be a grammar school in every major—pun not intended—town. In any case, notwithstanding what sources in Downing Street may or may not have said some time ago, the hon. Lady asked for my view. My view is that it is a matter for schools whether they choose to become selective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept that the Bill is the product of people who are much less relaxed about the failure of previous legislation to create many grant-maintained schools—that is why there is an element of compulsion in the Bill? There should be more consultation.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
Leeds, for example, has 50 secondary schools, only one of which has become grant-maintained. That is a particularly low proportion, but that suggests that schools and parents are satisfied with the work of the local education authority. An element of compulsion is being introduced in areas where grant-maintained schools have made little inroad because of the lack of success of previous legislation in introducing the changes that some Conservative Members want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has inadvertently made a rather important point that will recur throughout our proceedings. If parents in areas such as the one mentioned by the hon. Gentleman are satisfied with the education that their children receive at the moment, that is a very sorry state of affairs. The Government are constantly trying to find ways of ensuring that parents who are not satisfied with the level of education for their children can demand better. We believe that the mechanisms and procedures in the Bill will go a long way towards doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) hit the nail precisely on the head in his excellent intervention this morning. We are talking about aspirations, expectations and raising standards, not the mediocrity that all too many parents have apparently accepted in far too many places in the country. They have accepted the levels of education that have been exposed by the performance tables and OfSTED inspections, not least in areas such as Islington and Southwark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept that is is not a matter of parents being satisfied with mediocrity? They try all the time to help improve the system but they do not accept that the way to achieve that is to change the status of schools. They work with the local education authorities to bring about improvements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is as may be. The fact that eminent and distinguished members of the hon. Gentleman's party see things differently is a matter for them, and I respect their choice. Although I may regret the fact that all too many parents in areas such as the hon. Gentleman's have chosen not to accept grant-maintained schools, I respect their view. I think that their judgment is regrettable, but that is the end of the matter. As for suggesting that there is an element of compulsion, as the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) has done, nothing could be further from the truth. Opposition Members are displaying a sort of paranoia that they would do well to shed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us which clause places an obligation on a school to consult if they wish to go partially selective?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The consultation provision is in paragraph 6 of schedule 1. We shall expand on that subject later in our proceedings because those provisions are touched on in later amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
I must press on as I am barely half way through page two of what I hoped would be brief remarks. Opposition Members are detaining me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Staffordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee; I shall be as brief as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has constantly referred in a derogatory tone and manner to the local education authorities and to the vast majority of schools in them. I took the opportunity to look up some figures in the Library on the number of school leavers who have obtained five or more GCSE passes. The figure was 22 per cent. in 1965 and it is now 44 per cent. Those figures have been achieved by the LEAs, comprehensives and teachers about which the Government speak so disparagingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that we should always try to improve the system, but let us not overlook the tremendous advance that has been made in the past 30 years, although we are still falling below our international competitors. Let us not talk disparagingly about those organisations that try to achieve good education for our children. We have been talking about the opportunity and choice for schools, but we should be considering our children's opportunities and parental choice. We seem to be moving away from that focal point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The soft-path approach of suggesting that we should not be critical or look down our noses simply will not do. That is the cause of a large part of the problem in our education system. People such as the hon. Gentleman and his friends, both inside and outside of the House, have presided over a completely unsatisfactory education service for decades. That is exactly the problem. If it was not for us opening up the education system, in the of teeth of opposition from Opposition Members, by introducing performance tables, OFSTED inspections and so on, we would not know about the lack of performance in so many of those areas. I do not accept what the hon. Gentleman said, I do not accept his complacency and I do not accept that we can never be critical about what is going on in education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for pointing out that paragraph 6 of schedule 1 deals with consultation. However, I asked what requirement there was on a school to consult. Paragraph 6(2) of schedule 1 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In such a case the admission authority shall, before making such a variation of the admission arrangements, carry out such consultation (if any) as appears to them to be appropriate."</p></blockquote>
The Bill does not place a requirement on schools. Only if the governors believe that it is appropriate does the school have to consult, and if they do not think it appropriate, other schools in the area, the local authority, the community and parents are not consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman ignores the fact that the accountability that he requires is already built into the institutional arrangements of schools. School governors are accountable through school annual general meetings and through a panoply of other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
institutional arrangements that have been made of late. We want to do something that Opposition Members seem to be incapable of doing or unwilling to do; we want to honour schools' decisions about matters that are for the schools alone. The Opposition would not dream of doing that; they may pay lip service to it, but when it comes to the crunch, they will not do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difficulty here. If we in this Room do not understand what we mean by consultation, we shall have difficulties throughout our consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, there will be an increase of selection in schools. If that increase is not seen as changing the character of a school, it will not be subject to the existing consultation procedures. We believe that if such a change were to have an impact on the broader community and the feeder schools and not only on the governors and parents, there should be a duty to consult. In many of its clauses, the Bill denies that duty to consult. It says that there is no duty to consult. If the Minister agrees with us and wants consultation, parental choice and parental involvement and to raise standards—all things on which Government and Opposition should agree—we ask simply that the Government should accept the amendment. It is not that difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But not in these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because we are not yet discussing that particular amendment. The hon. Lady should be a little more patient. I am conscious of your eyes on the back of my neck, Sir Michael, as we meander through these digressions. I intended to discuss selection, which is what the hon. Member for Walton talked about. I am trying manfully to stick to that; we shall come to consultation later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, the Bill stipulates a threshold of 30 per cent. by ability, and by aptitude in the relevant specialist subjects for LEA schools and the specialist programme. Unlike other LEA schools, they may also select up to 20 per cent. by general ability without central approval. However, statutory proposals would be required if the total proportion of pupils selected rose above 30 per cent. Finally, the threshold is 50 per cent. for GM secondary schools other than those found to be failing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Up to those thresholds, admission authorities will be able to introduce selection or vary the proportion of pupils selected without statutory proposals. However, if the proportion of pupils selected changes and crosses the relevant threshold in either direction, statutory proposals will always be required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is there a difference in the maximum percentage between GM schools and LEA schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because that is our judgment of what is appropriate. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] Because we believe that the GM schools are, by definition, more independent and autonomous and more capable of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
making such decisions, and because we want to acknowledge the different status of GM and LEA schools. The hon. Gentleman may not have noticed, but they are quite different. That is the reason for the existence of the grant-maintained sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the proportion of pupils admitted to a school is already above the relevant threshold, changes will remain subject to existing arrangements. That means that statutory proposals will still be required if the change amounts to a significant alteration in the school's character, but not if only a small change is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 1 and clause 6 introduce a new duty for LEA and GM school admission authorities to consult locally before making changes—publication of statutory proposals is no longer required. Schedule 1 also gives the governing body of a county or voluntary-controlled specialist school that wants to introduce or extend selection up to a 30 per cent. threshold a right of appeal to the Secretary of State if the LEA, as the school's admission authority, does not respond constructively to its proposals. It also gives the governing body of a county school that wants the school to become 100 per cent. selective—that is, to become a grammar school—the right to publish its own statutory proposals if the LEA does not cooperate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, clauses 2 and 8 require the governing bodies of LEA and GM secondary schools that are not already 100 per cent. selective to consider each year the possibility of introducing or extending selection and to report their conclusions to parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background, but the hon. Member for Walton asked—and the Committee will want to know—why we want to make those changes. We recognise that children have different talents and different needs, and we believe that stretching the most able and supporting the least able, while developing particular aptitudes and interests, are tasks that the education system and different schools should undertake. It has been demonstrated that it is difficult for one type of school, especially at secondary level, to perform all those tasks well at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Walton pointed out—and there is no difference between us on this—parents naturally want the best education that will suit the particular needs and talents of their children. We want to allow the closest match between what parents want for their children, in their individual circumstances, and what schools can offer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister briefly outline what he believes to be the advantages of a selective school over a streamed school, where children can be netted according to their ability and taught material appropriate to their level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter of judgement both for the parents and those involved in the school. It is entirely possible that streaming or setting may be the answer in some circumstances, but we are suggesting that there may be other circumstances in which to go a stage further down the route that we are suggesting
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
would be more beneficial to groups or types of pupil. We are talking not about anything that is mutually exclusive, but about a range of possibilities within a flexible education system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between us and the Opposition is that Labour Members still cling to the classic comprehensive approach—it is the only one of which they can conceive. They are unable to accept that the mediocrity that has emerged from all too much of that comprehensive system is unacceptable. We believe that it is now time to move on and build on what we have learnt about choice and diversity and different sorts of schools, so that we can better respond to the huge variation in pupils' needs and wants. That is the difference between us, and I suspect, perhaps even regret, that no amount of debate will resolve that difference—the difference in philosophy remains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about diversity and schools specialising in teaching specific subjects or perhaps specific types of pupil. Schools will have to take account of what parents want rather than what teachers think they want. We know that many parents want to send their children to selective schools. If one wants evidence of that, one has only to look at the high ratio of applicants to places at grammar schools, which can often be 4:1 or even higher. We want to satisfy that demand where appropriate because parents understand that selective schools are good at stretching able pupils. The desire to send children to such schools is not confined to any one type of group, social or otherwise—the view is held across the spectrum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, a simple question from a simple mind: the Minister is clearly in favour of aggregating those with high ability and particular aptitudes, but does he believe the same of those with less ability? Should they be aggregated on the one site in the one school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may well be cases in which that would be to their advantage; I do not deny that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another difference is that Conservatives have never been persuaded that the social engineering imperative to which the Labour party signed up in the 1960s necessarily constituted the best educational provision for all children. The difference between us may simply be that Opposition Members always seem to believe that it is an overriding imperative to herd all the pupils in an area into one building and have them showering together and playing rugger together and so on, whereas we believe that the educational imperative may point in a different direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Picking up the point made by the hon. Member for Walton about special needs, I am not persuaded that integration or mainstream provision is in every case the best way to deal with a pupil who has many different special educational needs. I have always believed that there may well be a continuing role for specialist provision in specialist schools and one can
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
similarly demonstrate that pupils may well benefit educationally from being in a different school environment depending on their abilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister accepts that I said that integration and inclusive education should be used where appropriate; I did not say that it should be used in every case. Nevertheless, how does he view the integration of special needs pupils in, for example, grant-maintained schools that select up to 50 per cent. of their intake? Does he believe that they should be encouraged to integrate children with special educational needs into the school where appropriate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what successive statute sets out and I stand by that. All I am saying is that I remain to be persuaded of the correctness of the absolutist approach, which I accept the hon. Gentleman does not share. I know of no evidence that existing grant-maintained schools, whether selective or not, are in any way abandoning their obligation to provide for children with special educational needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman has evidence of that, I should like to see it because I am not aware of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a strange situation in Penarth, in south Wales, where both the secondary schools became grant maintained; one school had traditionally taken children from a school for children with physical disabilities to help integrate them and has continued to do so, but the other, Stanwell grant-maintained school, unfortunately, has a record of excluding pupils or of making an arrangement with the local college of further education to transfer to pupils there for classes, which is not illegal but is a neat way of getting low-achievers off the roll. That school has followed an aggressive policy in the past few years of trying to get rid of what might be termed troublesome or low-achieving pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a rather different point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not. Many of those pupils have special needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on whether they have a statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman now says that they do. I do not want to get drawn into a loose discussion about a particular case. It is possible that a judgment was made, in the individual circumstances, that the educational needs of many of those pupils would be better served by the arrangements to which the hon. Gentleman referred. If he gives me the evidence, I shall of course look at it, but it does not sound on the face of it as cataclysmic as he suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Evidence about that case has been passed to the Welsh Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I shall want to draw to the attention of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Evans), the point made by the hon. Gentleman to ensure that it is properly dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was arguing, in response to the point made by the hon. Member for Walton, that we must not be obsessed with the idea that selection is necessarily designed only for those of high abilities; it can, and I believe would, also benefit those of different types—I use the word advisedly—of ability. The whole point is that we are talking about identifying different young people's abilities, talents and needs and then finding the best way in which to meet those needs. That will often require different school settings. That is why we argue that the Bill is about enhancing choice and freedom for schools and for parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a child's abilities and talents emerge at the age of 14, and that child has not succeeded in getting into a grammar school at the age of 11, how will the system ensure that that child's potential is realised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may well be achieved by the solution that my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth set out earlier—who knows? That will be a matter for schools in the area to approach sensibly and work out their own solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some local education authorities have for decades failed their pupils and consigned them to the bottom of every performance table by failing properly to judge their educational needs. I do not claim that every area exhibits the excellence of judgment that my hon. Friend described in this area. It would be better if more areas did, but the way to achieve that is not by compulsion through legislation but by recognising the role of parental influence—giving parents a proper role in deciding what they want to do—and encouraging diversity of school provision. That is the way forward, not some heavy-handed, centralised approach of the kind of which I suspect that the hon. Member for Barking would rather approve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend analyse the Opposition's problem in this debate? Many Opposition Members come for academia—the theoretical world, not the practical world. Consequently, they think of people failing or succeeding—people who go to grammar school they consider successful; people who are secondary school educated, they often consider to be failures. Is not the reality—of which people such as me and my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. I am tempted to pursue the issue in a number of ways. The name Richard Branson springs to mind as a good example of what my hon. Friend may have in mind. Are we not in danger of becoming somewhat obsessed with the idea that only those who benefit
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
from a grammar school education or who go to university are likely to become worthwhile members of a society? What a disgraceful assumption to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about giving different people different opportunities at different stages of their lives. Given the concept of life-long learning—to which we are all now signed up, are we not, the only difference between us being how, not whether, it is introduced—the idea of selection or categorisation at different stages of people's lives is becoming less and less important, and so it should be. Whether or not people attend a particular sort of school at one point in their life or go to university at another is mercifully becoming less and less important. That is what we should be concentrating on, not this obsession with categorising people at different points in their lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, the point that we are trying to get at is that children who go to a nonselective school where there are high expectations and which is led by a head teacher who wants the children to do the very best are achievers. There is a school in my constituency which is non-selective—it is for Master Average. Five years ago, when the headmaster took over, the children were doing abysmally. Today, with new drive, new expectations and the correct courses, the children are going to university. We want high standards of leadership to push children up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just wanted to ask the Minister two things, one of which he may think reinforces his case. Three playwrights from my home town, Jimmy McGovern, Alan Bleasdale and Willy Russell, were all 11-plus failures; all went on to become successful. I tell a lie, McGovern was not an 11-plus failure, but he had a special need. All three were successful in later life. If asked, both Bleasdale and Russell will tell of their humiliation at being arbitrarily rejected at the age of 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister agree that the national targets are based on the expectation that all children must improve their qualifications? I should not like the Minister to leave the impression that he is dismissive of the idea that all our young people must be highly qualified and skilled to meet the economic and social challenges of the 21st century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am sure that that is right. What troubles me about the hon. Gentleman's first point is that there is a great danger that Opposition Members are putting people into boxes and categories in a way that we do not intend to do. The constant talk about labelling people as failures is an obsession of Opposition Members, which is self-perpetuating.

The Bill personifies my argument. It acknowledges the wonderful diversity and variety of the human condition and allows our education system to respond to it. We are not in the business of cramming everyone into the same box and expecting them all to fulfil the potential. That has failed demonstrably over the past 30 years and we are trying to break out of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say to the hon. Member for Walton that I was not successful in obtaining the 11-plus. In his words, I am an "11-plus failure". Two of my sons were not successful in obtaining the 11-plus and it would take a brave man to tell me to my face that they are failures. Furthermore, even though I did not pass the 11-plus, I became managing director of a fairly large group. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that I was a failure? My hon. Friend the Minister is right. We should not stuff people into failure boxes. It is that stigma that does the damage. The hon. Member for Walton is wrong to persist with such an approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. As ever, he makes the point better than me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already heard Opposition Members assert that selection can help only the few and will hurt or prejudice the many. The hon. Member for Walton mentioned the Ridings. I think that the authority was under no overall control when the schools merged—a detail that may or may not be important. What is much more important is that the inspectors' report on the Ridings made it clear that, in terms of education and discipline, the school compared badly with other schools with similar intakes. That is different from the comparison that Opposition Members wish to make of the Ridings vis-à-vis the local selective school, grammar school or other school. The inspectors made comparisons with similar schools—that was the problem. They did not make comparisons with different types of schools—something on which we should concentrate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no meaningful correlation between the location of poor schools and areas with selective schools. We have examined the location of the 100 schools with the highest proportions of pupils achieving no GCSE passes in 1995. Only 10 of the 29 LEA areas with selective schools contained such schools. Moreover, we cannot find any evidence that the existence of selective schools depressed standards at non-selective schools in the area. We have examined the GCSE results in local education authority areas with substantial proportions of pupils in grammar schools. In most of those areas—a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth made so ably—the rate of improvement in results in the nonselective schools has been close to or better than the national average from maintained secondary schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is disregarding the socioeconomic background of the pupils in a particular school. Before Conservative Members shake their heads in disbelief, let me say that I believe strongly that whatever a pupil's socio-economic background, we should ensure that he attains a much higher level pass than he does currently. Part of the failure in the Government's record in education is that socioeconomic background plays too great a role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the five GCSEs at grades A to C, taken from a table in a publication on education by Clive Chitty and Caroline Benn. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] I know that some hon. Members do not like the facts, but the statistics are based on evidence of results published by Government Departments. In areas where the intake is mostly working class, 26.3 per cent. will get five GCSEs at grades A to C. In areas where the intake is mostly middle class, 54-6 per cent. of the pupils, whether in grammar schools or not, get five GCSEs at grades A to C. To ignore that, as the Minister is currently doing, shows a naivety and lack of understanding that ill-behoves a Minister responsible for the education of our children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wondered when that would come up, but here it is—a shocking, but unsurprising revelation. It is the typical patronising attitude of some Opposition Members who believe that if someone is poor, he is stupid; or if he comes from a difficult or deprived background, we cannot expect much of him. That attitude has bedevilled education in some areas—not least in Islington—for generations. Governors, teachers, parents and the LEA have no expectations of the young people in that area and have been satisfied with the sort of failure to which the hon. Lady has referred. That is the ultimate condemnation of the attitude of Opposition Members and we reject it entirely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill proposes something totally and completely different. We have expectations for our children and we want to find the best ways of fulfilling their talent and potential. We believe that the best way of doing that is to have a diversity of school and educational provision. I utterly reject the patronising assumption underlying the hon. Lady's remarks, on which members of the Committee will want to dwell for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must complete my argument—there is only one page left, which I am sure the Committee will be happy to hear. But it is relevant and in response to the remarks of the hon. Member for Walton. I was going on to argue that the overall rate of improvement for non-selective schools in areas with selective schools has been significantly faster than the rate in areas with no selective schools. I agree with the point made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth about the effect of pulling up the performance of all schools by the mechanism that he described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rather low expectations of Opposition Members cannot be borne out, even by an examination of the evidence available now. There is the oft-made assertion—the hon. Member for Walton

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
made it—that if there are selective schools in an area, somehow the others are adversely affected. Our evidence points in the other direction, if anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister enlighten us about the inner-city areas on which he has based his conclusions? What indicators of social deprivation, if any, have been considered in making the assertion that there is no relationship between socio-economic class—admittedly only one relevant factor—and the success of selection?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood. I am not talking about socio-economic class, but the comparison, in published results, between areas with both selective and non-selective schools, and so on. I am not talking about socio-economic class; I do not talk in those terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am simply asking the Minister to tell us what type of area proves his thesis. What type of people live in those areas? Do they have the full range of advantages and disadvantages? Those are simple questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not interested in which type of people live in an area. The Conservative side of the House is classless. Conservative Members are not heard talking about types of people. We do not put people into categories. We have moved on from that 1960s and 1970s talk. Such attitudes are prevalent among Opposition Members, even in what they choose to call new Labour, but we utterly reject them. Opposition Members are condemned out of their own mouths.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will gather from what I have said that I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's general or specific arguments. Clever though they might appear, the amendments are designed to undermine the principles on which the Bill is based. As I have said, we want the choices about the nature of schools and their approach to education to be made as locally and as specifically to them as possible. I ask the Committee to reject the amendments because they would undermine those principles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate has been interesting because it has brought out some of the real differences between the Government and the Opposition in their views on selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought the comment made by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam that not every member of the Committee was interested in raising standards was absolutely futile; it did nothing to further this debate. I would never deny that Conservative Members want to raise standards. People do not enter politics and express an interest in education if they do not care about raising standards for children. However, the Tories go about that in the wrong way. That is the difference between Conservative Members and Opposition Members. Let us at least agree that, as politicians interested in education, we are concerned about raising standards for children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to correct the hon. Lady's misapprehension that I suggested that not everyone wants to raise standards. We are trying to raise standards in a way that is most beneficial to all children, depending on their aptitude and ability. Surely the hon. Lady would agree that able children should have the type of schooling that maximises their talents. Does she not agree that children who are what I call Master Average should have the type of schooling that correctly suits their aptitude and rate of development? Selection is appropriate for some children, others are better off at other types of school that can develop their talents to the very highest level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the hon. Lady has taken the opportunity to withdraw the allegation that not every member of the Committee is concerned about raising standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, children must be taught to develop their aptitude and strengths. That is what teachers do. It can be done as well in good comprehensive schools as in selective schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the Minister has not heeded the words that he uttered this summer in Australia. He said that the problem with the Government is that they have spent most of the past 17 years talking about structure when they should have been talking about standards. It is a shame that yet another Bill deals with structure, not standards and the essence of teaching and learning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the record, I gave that interview in London to an Australian broadcast journalist, so I knew that it would be in the public domain. There was never any suggestion that it would not reach this country. In any case, I rarely say anything that I am not happy to be in the public domain. From memory, I did not quite say what the hon. Lady suggested. I think that I said that, with hindsight, many of us thought that we should have tackled certain matters earlier than we did. I stand by that. When we did tackle those problems, the hon. Lady's party opposed almost everything that we tried to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can argue over the words once we have them in front of us. The Minister said that we had spent too much time talking about structure and not enough about standards. I am happy to apologise if that direct quote was wrong; I read it, but did not memorise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate has shown up a clear division on the Government Benches. There is a huge split in Conservative Members' attitudes to selection. I was amazed to hear the Minister say that he could not care two hoots whether schools were selective. That view is not shared by the hon. Members for Rugby and Kenilworth or for Sutton and Cheam, nor by many of the hon. Members who represent seats in Kent. It is on record that they are wedded to bringing back grammar schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sat in Committees where the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth has hoisted the flag for grammar schools. I suspect that the right hon.

Member for Brent, North (Sir R. Boyson) thinks the same, as do the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) and the Prime Minister. However, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment does not agree with the return of selection. The Tory party has been calling in part for a return to selection for the past five years—clear blue water and "The Way Forward". The Secretary of State, however, does not believe in it and has never acted to bring it back, so we have a mishmash of a Bill trying to steer a centre course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was right when he asked my hon. Friend the Member for Walton whether he believed that the Bill would introduce more selection. Conservative Members do not know; one half of them hope that the Bill will herald a return to selection and the other half hope that it will not. Not to know about the future structure of schools is no way to run the education system. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth looks as if he wants to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to intervene. I have considerable affection for the hon. Lady. I respect her sincerity and her integrity and I know that she would not seek to misquote me. However, I should tell her that I believe in people having the maximum of freedom and choice. That is what the Bill will do. It is permissive. It means that people can do it if they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the hon. Lady joining us. I do not believe that she is a doctrinaire socialist; she is a decent, intelligent woman, who puts children before the dogmas that she might otherwise espouse. She wants people to have greater freedom and choice. Those factors motivate her just as they motivate me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has made it clear that he does not want to return to grammar schools throughout the country. Individual Tory Members should say whether they want to return to grammar schools, just as we heard their views on caning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth is wrong. I do not think that I misrepresent his views. I apologise if I am wrong, but I believe that he would like a mainly selective education system. The evidence for my belief came from his own mouth earlier. He quite rightly praised the schools in his constituency; that is part of his job as a local Member of Parliament, and there are certainly some fine schools there. But whenever he does so, he names only the parts of his constituency that have selective education. Why did not he tell us about Kenilworth school? It is the only secondary school in the town, yet in yesterday's league results, it scored 56 per cent. in the five A to C grade category. That was a real and massive achievement for a comprehensive school in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. I wonder why, when he intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for Walton, he did not acknowledge that success in the comprehensive system. In one intervention after another, hon. Members have plucked figures out of the examination results—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mrs. Cheryl Gillan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just as the hon. Lady has done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have any selective or grant-maintained schools in my constituency; if I did, I would praise them. I am not partial in my praise of excellence—unlike Conservative members of the Committee, who seem to value success only in a system to which they are dogmatically attracted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government pretend that under the Bill, schools will be able to decide what they want to do and that they do not care two hoots what that decision is. Frankly, I do not believe them. That is what they said before the introduction of grant-maintained schools; they talked about parental rights and choice then and said that it would be up to local schools whether they became grant-maintained. They said it was about individual choice—and what happened? When schools did not become grant-maintained, we witnessed financial bribes being offered to force them to do so; when schools still did not become grant-maintained, their governors were forced to consider it year after year after year, even though they had previously rejected it. When they still refused to take grant-maintained status, Tory Members called for all LEAs to be abolished so that the schools would have to take it. And when they continued to refuse, the Government issued a consultation paper to force aided schools to become grant-maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what will happen under the Bill. If schools do not choose to become selective, Tory Members, who are wedded to selection and believe passionately that the country would be better if we had it, will start to put pressure on schools. They will also bring in more legislation to offer schools financial inducements to become selective, and there will be scare stories about the pressures being put on schools to stop them becoming grant-maintained. The problem with the legislation is that it is not brave enough to go the whole way—to fulfil the Prime Minister's pledge of a grammar school in every town—although it is sufficiently loose to give the public the impression that it will; amendments and additions will be made to it later because a sizeable number of the parliamentary Tory party intend to take us back to selection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady cannot have it both ways. On the one hand, she declares that Conservative Members have exerted enormous pressure—a word she continually uses—to force schools into becoming grant maintained, but on the other, she continually tells us about the failure of grant-maintained schools and points out that only 1,100 of some 20,000 schools have taken grant-maintained status. Does she accept that that is a major flaw in her argument? To extend the argument, as she does, from grant-maintained schools to painting a picture of what may or may not happen in the far distant future is stretching credibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot be answerable for the Government's failure; I can be answerable only for the Opposition's success. The Government did not control the part of the grant-maintained process that involves

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
the cross that is put against the "yes" or the "no" on the ballot papers. Parents exercised their right—despite all the pressure, the money spent on advertising and the glossy brochures—and voted against. I do not know whether the Government should have abolished ballots, but some Tory Members clearly believed that schools should be obliged to become grant-maintained. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam may nod—maybe she was one of them. Tremendous pressure was placed on schools to become grant maintained and I predict that that will also happen if schools do not voluntarily become selective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am against selection, partly as a politician and partly as someone who taught in an inner-city comprehensive school for 18 years. There are many reasons for being against selection: it denies parental choice and causes problems for children who are rejected. The main reason why I oppose selection, however, relates to what the Minister was saying—I believe that it institutionalises low expectations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the right hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Mr. Patten) was Secretary of State, he often said, "We should not excuse underachievement; we should have the highest expectations". Although, with the greatest respect, I did not admire the right hon. Gentleman's politics, I admired that much-repeated phrase. The right hon. Gentleman was right. How can one send the message to children that one expects them to do well, that one thinks that they will be the brightest and that they will succeed at the highest level if one labels them a failure at the age of 11?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not Labour Members who are labelling children, but they are being labelled. Has anyone ever heard a child say, "I passed for secondary modern school"? That is not the language of the playground. When 11-plus results come out, children say "I passed" or "I failed". That language is not dictated to them by Labour Members or Labour councillors; it is their language, which they have learnt from their parents, their friends and the expectations of the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members are kidding themselves if they think that children believe that they "pass" by going to a secondary modern school, and that society is telling them that they are a success and that it has high expectations of them. Let me be gracious; that might be the honourable aspiration of Conservative Members, but it does not work. There is no evidence whatever that children who fail the 11-plus and go to secondary modern schools take with them the message that they are worth as much as the children who go to grammar schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give credit to those individuals who have succeeded against the odds—the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth is among them. What on earth are we doing putting obstacles in their way when they clearly are so able? The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth should have been identified as someone with great academic potential, but the system got it wrong and failed to recognise his potential. I have just read his entry in "Who's Who". He may have succeeded in becoming a managing director, but his failure in the 11-plus denied him a place at university
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
and a degree—unless he does not declare all his educational opportunities. The hon. Gentleman succeeded despite that, but he went to a selective school at a time when failure in the 11-plus meant that the door to higher education was shut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the problem; selection closes doors for too many pupils. The notion that day to day, somewhere in Rugby and Kenilworth, children are swapping from grammar schools to secondary modern schools is beyond belief. The hon. Member for Rubgy and Kenilworth is not in the Room at the moment, but I hope that he will produce figures showing how many children have moved from secondary modern schools to grammar schools in Rugby. After my constituency, I know the hon. Gentleman's best. Children there move at sixth-form level, post-16, to obtain the opportunities that secondary modern schools deny them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are against selection not because we think that all children are the same or because we do not want to reward excellence. We believe fundamentally that if one wants to raise standards, if one values every child and if one has every expectation that each child can succeed, one should not set up a system that contains even a risk of labelling children failures and sapping their confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to put things into perspective. The suggestion is that just because children have gone to a non-selective school, they are failures, but I should draw to the hon. Lady's attention the fact that there is a non-selective school in my constituency, Cheam high school. The school is run in such a way, and the head has such expectations for those young pupils, that many of them go on to university. It is ridiculous to suggest that because they do not attend a selective school they cannot achieve. The truth is that that school is tailored to ensure that pupils do their best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another school in my constituency—a comprehensive school—has a fast stream, a selective stream; but regrettably the A-level pupils there are not doing nearly as well as those in other selective schools in the grant-maintained sector. That suggests that children at that particular comprehensive are being short changed. I think that we should expand the selective scheme and allow pupils at comprehensive schools the same benefits as are allowed to pupils at selective schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not knowing much about the hon. Lady's constituency. I may be wrong, but I believe that if we allow selective schools there can be no comprehensive schools. A comprehensive school is one that takes children regardless of ability. If the system creams off the top 10 per cent. or 15 per cent., the remaining schools cannot be comprehensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are important and provide another argument against the attitude that we should leave it to schools to decide. We leave schools to decide a whole range of matters, such as their relationship with the local community and with parents, how they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
teach and how children learn, extra-curricular activities, ethos and values. We leave it to the schools to do all those things, and long may it be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, Parliament is responsible for creating a system to allow schools to do that as easily as possible. The problem is that as soon as one school takes a course of action that affects its intake, the intake of other schools will be affected. That is unarguable. There are many decisions that schools can take that have no effect on neighbouring schools. None of the decisions that I mentioned just now would be detrimental to other schools. Crucially, admissions arrangements do not fall into that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot sit back and say that it is up to individual schools. We have a responsibility to protect schools from the actions of other schools. Schools are individually responsible for their own standards, but they operate in a community of schools. The actions of one school with affect others. Whenever a school chooses to select, neighbouring schools will fell the consequences. The notion that schools decide only for themselves and that their decisions will not affect others is probably, if the Government really believe it, the core reason that the Bill is flawed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My point is that the Bill denies flexibility. It seeks to ossify the school system into grammar schools and secondary modern schools. We contend that that will have deleterious effects—whether they are called secondary moderns or comprehensives—on the children who have no choice about which school to attend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The Bill will hinder our quest to raise standards for all children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An alternative view is that the hon. Lady's solution would ossify a grey and mediocre comprehensive system. We, however, are promoting a variety of schools, rather successfully. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State works ceaselessly to promote the concept of specialist schools to provide diversity and choice. If ossification is the word of the moment, it is surely to be used about the monopolistic comprehensive system rather than the variety that we pursue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just proved my point. He says that he could not care two hoots whether the schools stay comprehensive or go for selection, yet each time he opens his mouth, the adjectives he uses to describe comprehensive schools are detrimental to such schools. He talks about the greyness of monopolistic comprehensive schools. Where is the praise for them? I am amazed that having reached the position of Minister of State at the Department for Education and Employment, he can sit so easy in his chair in Sanctuary buildings when he clearly has such
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
a low view of comprehensive schools. I wonder why he has not gone the whole hog and introduced measures to get rid of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady asked for praise for comprehensive schools. I give it gladly to St. George's Church of England comprehensive school and to St. John's Roman Catholic comprehensive school, both of which are in my constituency. The children attend those schools because their parents chose to send them there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grammar schools and high schools are also in my constituency. The hon. Lady referred to the failures who attend high schools, but I can tell her that the children who go to the Northfleet school for boys and the Northfleet school for girls would bitterly resent such remarks, not least because many of them go on to attend university. That shows that high schools can succeed alongside grammar and comprehensive schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the high schools in the hon. Gentleman's constituency have done well. I congratulate them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arnold</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And my comprehensive schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add my congratulations to those comprehensive schools. Wherever there is excellence, we must praise it. I wonder how many parents whose children attend comprehensive schools, however, might have wanted them to attend a grammar school, but did not have that choice because grammar schools choose their pupils. I would never say that a pupil from a secondary modern school could not succeed. Of course, they can. But for every child who makes it, despite the odds, so many more children could have succeeded had they not been labelled at the age of 11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect, I shall not give way to my hon. Friend. I shall give way to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way because I know that she is coming to her peroration. I have been listening carefully to her argument. She obviously objects to parents putting their children forward for selective schools, thereby taking those more able pupils out of the comprehensive system that she would like to see across the board. Perhaps she will tell the Committee whether she objects to those parents who also self-select out of the community and who choose to send their children to independent schools. If we take the logic of her argument further, she is moving towards the abolition of independent schools because its pupils are taken out of the system and, therefore, diminish the comprehensivisation of the system of which she is in favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that this country still has an independent sector. I was about to describe it as "strong and thriving", but I am not sure that those are the correct adjectives. As a Member of Parliament, I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
do not have responsibility for the independent sector, but I share a responsibility for the state sector. Neither I nor my party has any intention of abolishing the independent sector. When we are in Government, however, we shall fulfil our obligation to ensure that standards rise within the state sector. Perhaps if there were Ofsted inspectors in the private sector, standards there might rise too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the hon. Lady has no objection to selection being brought by the wealthiest people in the country, but she would deny that selection to people who rely on state-funded education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We live in a society where people have rights and where they have a right to take a different view from others. If I had children, I would not buy them private education. If people asked for my views on the matter, I would not advise them to buy private education. My personal view is that it can damage the state system. To put that a different way round, if children who are currently in the independent sector were educated in the state system, it would be stronger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would never deny an individual's right to buy education as long as we have a state that alllows them to do that, but I spend little time thinking about it, and I have no personal intention of suggesting it and nor does my party. I find it strange that the Minister conducts the consideration of a Bill that will affect 95 per cent. of the nation's children by arguing about the life chances of the 5 per cent. who will not be affected by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am about to finish; I have tried to do so about six times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, it better had be. Go on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady clarify a point on independent schools, which she said she had no intention of interfering with? Will independent schools be allowed to keep their charitable educational status under a Labour Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what that has got to do with the Bill, or why the hon. Lady does not read the newspapers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady for Sutton and Cheam has an interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So she has; I forgot. My party has no intention of removing the charitable status of independent schools. We have said—as the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam would know if she had done her background reading, rather than wasting time asking such questions—that we want a different sort of relationship between the state and independent sectors. That is all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will affect the 96 per cent. of children who are in the state sector and if we go down the mishmash road of the Bill, we must protect schools that will have to operate in an area where selection takes place. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Walton, which set out criteria that the Secretary of State could use in deciding whether selection should take place, should be wholly welcomed and I urge the Committee to support them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak about parental choice because over the past year my office has spent much time securing choice for parents in Morley. In that sense, we spend our time implementing aspects of Government policy. We have supported more than 50 parents in appeals against judgments, mainly in regard to high school placements. We have often secured second appeals for them and in two cases we subsequently supported their referring the case to the local government ombudsman. Most of those cases were connected with parents failing to get their choice at any of the three comprehensive schools in Morley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Bill make it easier or harder for parents to get their choice? I believe that it will make it harder. We previously had a grammer school in Morley—Morley grammar—and two secondary modern schools, and the selective system was clearly in operation through the 11-plus. After that was abolished, there was a gradual evolution into three reasonably comparable comprehensive schools. Parents choose each of those schools, but they frequently do not get the school of their choice because there are more children wanting to go to the three schools than there are places available. Things will be a little easier in 1997 due to the foresight of Leeds city council in applying for more school places and the co-operation of the Government in giving permission for the capital to be spent on that. However, there will still be problems in giving people the school of their choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will not give parents more parental choice. More school choice means less parental choice because schools will be able to choose first. As a result of the Greenwhich judgment anyone from Kirklees who applies for a school place in Morley will get it. If one of the schools in Morley will get it. If one of the schools in Morley because more selective, it would have to take children applying from Kirklees, which would result in fewer selective places being available for children from Morley. If one school were allowed excessive selection, we would rapidly find fewer parents getting the school of their choice. All three comprehensive schools are above average in terms of the tables that have been published today, and two of them are well above average in their A-levels and GSCE results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that when an element of selection is introduced, there will be no more excellent comprehensive schools in Morley. The town still regards itself as having a degree of independence and as not being fully intergrated into the city of Leeds, even though it is administratively. But we have sought a place in a Morley school for each Morley child. That will be impossible if one or two of those schools become selective. There will be disparity among the schools which will soon be noticed by parents who already have a perception of a school's performance. Family backround and tradition play a part in their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
choice of school, but it tends to be dictated largely by geography. However, if selection is applied in an area such as Morley, it will undoubtedly mean that far fewer parents get the school of their choice. That should certainly be resisted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that there is no sense of failure felt by those who are not selected, but there can be a sense of failure even under the present system. I secured a second appeal for one child in my constituency. He was the only one within a close circle of friends at his first school who failed, initially, in his choice of secondary school. He had a brother in that school, but because the brother was leaving in the same year that the choice was being made, he was treated as not having a sibling there. That child became extremely depressed and morose perceived it as a failure when his school was not accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have observations on the framework of the Bill, some historical points and specific matters relating to Wales, which I hope to complete within five minutes as I see the Minister is becoming a little worried about his opportunity to reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Historically, we had a grammar and secondary modern system. Some schools were regarded as successes and others as failures. Some of the failures became successes later on, but that was despite the system rather than because of it. We now have a largely comprehensive system, and there have been general improvements in national results. In Wales, we have no overtly selective schools and non-selective schools are at the heart of those improvements. However, despite those improvements, we still have a very long tail—people are failing whatever is done in particular areas. That is the problem that we must address, and selection does not help us to tackle it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past year, in one old county council area the issue of selection was discussed by all secondary school head teachers as part of a Welsh Office consultation exercise. One head teacher wanted to have a selective intake. That one school was doing reasonably well; it was not the best, but it was achieving more than a 50 per cent. pass rate at grades A to C. Other schools were in a similar position; one or two were not doing so well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing in mind that parents can already make a choice within the limits of available school premises, all the other heads said that they did not want selection. Why not? They felt that if that one school selected, a school that might currently be getting 25 per cent. of its pupils through and was improving would lose some of its intake and find it more difficult to make the necessary improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such a situation, would the Minister agree that as all the other secondary heads were happy with the admission arrangements, we should not allow the one school that wanted to become selective to endanger the achievements of the other schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister indicates that he would not. It would, therefore, be possible that parents in that area would not necessarily get the school of their choice, because some children in the catchment area of the selective school might not receive places because they were not considered good enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is assuming in his hypothetical case that the other schools would just sit there and let it happen. Other schools would react as they thought necessary; there would be a period of change and adjustment, and schools would do what they thought best for themselves in the context of the area. One school can neither dictate nor preclude a response from the others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is where we have a fundamentally different view of what the future would hold and what would be the knock-on effect in an area if a school became selective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also like the Minister to consider rural areas. None of the Conservative members of the Committee represents a truly rural area. The three men who are here because it is de rigueur—the Minister, the Whip and the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, who is the chairman of the Conservative parliamentary education committee—represent midlands seats. All the other Conservative Members represent the home counties, so we do not have any truly rural experience on the Government Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About 80 per cent. of Wales is rural, and secondary schools are in some cases a considerable distance apart. If one school were to become selective and say that certain children could not attend the school, the knock-on consequences for pupils in some parts of Wales would involve considerable travel. Would travel costs be automatically reimbursed in such circumstances—although I hope that they will not arise? How does the Minister think that the choice of children in rural areas who are excluded from the secondary school in their home town will have been increased by their having to travel for an hour or more across Wales to a comprehensive school?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to concentrate our efforts on raising standards in all schools. Selection will make that more difficult, because the better pupils will tend to be creamed off from schools where things are not going so well. We should ensure that all schools do well and, in particular, that extra help and support is provided for those schools that are currently shown to have high educational needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
