Grants for Pre-School Education (Social Security Information) (Scotland) Regulations 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Liddell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Grants for Pre-School Education (Social Security Information) (Scotland) Regulations 1996. (S.I. 1996, No. 3078).</p></blockquote>
The reason that we sought this debate relates to issues that were raised during the proceedings on the Education (Scotland) Act 1996 on the use of public money to fund a private release of social security information to third parties. We are concerned about who will use that information and how it will be used. The information is potentially sensitive and, if it falls into the wrong hands, could be misused.<br><br>
The statutory instrument prescribes information relating to a claim for child benefit as "social security information" which the Secretary of State may provide to any person involved in the making of grants to providers of education for children under school age. I emphasise the word "any" because there is potential for a wide range of people to have access to the information—for example, a provider, a successor to Capita Management Services, the subcontractor that is handling the management of nursery vouchers, and so on.<br><br>
Will the Minister explain why it is necessary that so many people are entitled to have access to such information? If he really considered that it was important to have such a regulation in place, why was it not more tightly drawn to limit the number of people entitled to have access to it? If the regulations are primarily to allow only Capita Management access to names and addresses of eligible children, will all the staff of Capita be allowed access to it, or only specified persons within Capita? What safeguards have the Government built into the contract for Capita to ensure that the information is used sensitively?<br><br>
I raised the matter with the Minister during the debate on the Education (Scotland) Act 1996. He replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"The clause is designed to allow access to the information required for the voucher system—and only such information—while retaining all necessary controls"—[<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee</i>, 18 June 1996; c. 131.1</p></blockquote>
over the voucher system.<br><br>
It has come to my attention that the Education spokesperson in the House of Lords, Lord Henley,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
who deals with matters relating to education in England, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"there is no restriction on the information that anyone can provide to the voucher agency."</p></blockquote>
Which Minister is right? Will the hon. Gentleman clarify the matter?<br><br>
I refer again to the proceedings on the Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained Schools Bill as it passed through the other place last year. Lord Henley said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We will require the contractor appointed for phase two of the scheme to take effective measures to ensure the confidentiality of personal information".—[<i>Official Report, House of Lords</i>, 9 July 1996; Vol. 574, c. 282–4.]</p></blockquote>
Can the Minister assure me that such measures have been taken in relation to the information that is required in Scotland? As the Minister knows, Opposition Members have not seen the contract that Capita has signed, which makes it difficult for us to feel reassured that matters are being dealt with properly.<br><br>
I am concerned also about the impact of the data protection legislation on the release of the information, and its storage one stage on by Capita. Will the Minister explain whether the Child Benefit Agency is covered by the Data Protection Act 1988 and what its impact will be on Capita Management Services? Those are my concerns about the matter. It may seem a singularly small issue to be considered in a statutory instrument Committee, but the implications for confidential information are considerable. Not least of my concerns is that information may be divulged about a child who is in a place of safety. The implications of an undesirable person obtaining access to that information do not bear thinking about.</span></p>
<p>4.35 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In initiating this short debate, the hon. Lady has asked for reassurances which I gave to her in a previous Committee; I am happy to repeat them now. Only the name, address and date of birth of each child for whom the child benefit is claimed and the name and address of the person by whom the claim is made are covered. No other information whatever will be transferred from the Department of Social Security to either my officials or Capita.<br><br>
The hon. Lady asked who would receive the information. I can assure her that only civil servants in my Department and the officials in the voucher management company who are dealing with the issuing of vouchers will be given that information—obviously, the Department of Social Security has it already.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In relation to the transfer of information, how many people in Capita are likely to be involved?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Only those members of Capita who are dealing with the issue of the vouchers. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0082">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
cannot say to the hon. Lady whether that is two, three or four people, as I do not know how Capita organises its affairs. However, I can assure her that only those officials who are dealing with the vouchers and sending them out will have the information—it will not be more widely spread in the voucher management company.<br><br>
The other persons referred to in the Education (Scotland) Act 1996 may be auditors in the National Audit Office or officers of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration making inquiries. They may also include staff to whom the functions of the NAO or the Scottish Office may be contracted out in the future although, as the hon. Lady knows, we have no plans to do that.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Lady will accept my assurances that the information will be tightly held. Only the names and addresses of the children and those claiming benefit on their behalf will be taken from the Department of Social Security register.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I continue to have some anxieties; we shall keep watch over this matter. I am not reassured because I have not seen the Capita contract and the requirements that have been placed on it to ensure that the information is held in confidence. I have some fears that the information could be more widely divulged and end up in the hands of those who should not have access to it.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Minister for his response. This is a matter that we shall want to examine further.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Grants for Pre-School Education (Social Security Information) (Scotland) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 3078).</p></blockquote></p>
