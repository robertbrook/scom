	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Government Finance Special Grant Report (No. 24): Special Grant for Asylum Seekers' Accommodation, House of Commons Paper No. 257.</p></blockquote>
The report specifies a determination concerning special grants which the Government propose to pay to certain local authorities in England. Special grant report No. 24 has been submitted by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health and it sets out the arrangements for the grants in respect of the costs of accommodating adult asylum seekers unaccompanied by children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will know that asylum seekers who claim asylum at the point of arrival in this country are entitled to social security benefits which cover their needs for housing, food and other necessities. In February last year my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security implemented regulations which withdrew benefits for asylum seekers who claim asylum after they have entered this country. In June, these regulations were declared ultra vires by the High Court. In consequence, removal of rights to benefits for these people was then re-enacted in the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. From the end of July, therefore, only those who applied for asylum on the point of entry to the UK have received social security benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In early August, a small number of people who had claimed asylum after entering the country and so were ineligible for benefits approached social services departments for aid. After social services provision was refused, four of those asylum seekers sought judicial review against the local authorities concerned; an interim court order obliged the local authorities to accommodate asylum seekers while proceedings were pending. On 8 October 1996, the High Court ruled that local authorities had a duty under section 21(1)(a) of the National Assistance Act 1948 to provide services as a safety net of last resort to those who, by reason of destitution, were unable to fend for themselves. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health, with the authorities concerned—Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Lambeth—appealed against that ruling; the appeal was dismissed on 17 February. We are currently seeking leave to appeal to the House of Lords because we do not accept that the National Assistance Act
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
1948 should apply to adult asylum seekers who are not elderly, infirm or disabled and have no need for community care services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The judgment has had serious consequences for many social services authorities, particularly in London. It has imposed a new duty on them to support people for whom they have never before had to provide services. Although the number of people claiming asylum in this country has fallen since the removal of benefits, so suggesting that the intended disincentive to economic migrants is working, the numbers remain relatively high. At 21 February, 3,501 adults were being accommodated by London authorities and at least 200 were being accommodated outside London. It is not right that such a financial burden should be imposed on council tax payers, or that services for local people suffer as a result of the court ruling. The Government have agreed therefore that a special grant should be made to authorities to meet the reasonable costs incurred by them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise that these judgments have not altered our view that the availability of benefits and housing has attracted people to come to this country who are not in fear of persecution, but are actually seeking to improve their economic position. That is a clear abuse of asylum-seeking status and the benefits system. In 1988, the United Kingdom received 4,000 asylum applications. By 1995 the number of asylum applications had increased to 44,000, although that fell back to 28,000 in 1996 primarily as a result of the changes in entitlement to benefits. However, although there was also an increase in the number of asylum seekers recognised as refugees from 628 in 1988 to 2,240 in 1996, the proportion of successful applicants fell from 23 per cent. to 6 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for that dramatic drop in successful applications as a proportion of total claims was not that the Home Office was applying strict criteria—the same criteria were being applied as set out in the United Nations refugee convention. The reason was that far fewer of those claiming asylum were doing so out of fear of persecution. If people are not in fear of persecution, one of the principal reasons for them coming to this country to claim asylum must be that they are economic migrants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The special grant will enable authorities to claim funds up to the equivalent of £165 per person per week, averaged out over the relevant period. Authorities will also be able to claim up to £10 per person per week for documented costs incurred in commissioning new premises for housing asylum seekers. Authorities were consulted on the details of the grant and have been given guidance on how to claim reimbursement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be no threshold on costs incurred for the grant, below which no grant would be payable. With the adult asylum seekers grant, an authority will be able to claim reimbursement even if it is accommodating only one asylum seeker. The grant will not require authorities to meet a proportion of the cost provided that they have been able to keep the costs down to a reasonable level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
It is not reasonable to assume that authorities would have been able to place people from day one in fully equipped and cheap-to-run accommodation. Much would have depended on the facilities to which they had access, and chance would have dictated that. To cope with initial demand, many authorities have had to make use of more expensive—especially bed-and-breakfast—accommodation. I understand that a few people were even placed initially in existing residential accommodation, again an expensive and inappropriate option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we consider that, over time, authorities should have been able to organise more economical accommodation. For that reason, we propose an average unit cost that assumes that there is a falling scale of cost over the period from October—and in a few instances August—to the end of this month.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In arriving at the unit cost figure, a range of sources was considered to provide evidence on which to base a calculation of a reasonable unit cost. That included information, for example, on the costs of hostels and night shelters operated by the Salvation Army and the Refugee Council and actual data from individual boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The material considered showed, predictably, a huge range in costs, depending on the nature of the provision. We believe that a fixed unit cost should cover basic accommodation costs, food and associated administrative and assessment costs to the local authority. The unit cost we have arrived at is in the middle of the range of costs considered. Although it would have been unfair and unreasonable to try to impose a weekly limit from the lower end of the range, it is equally important to realise that we had to contain the overall costs within a certain limit and to encourage authorities to continue to find ways of accommodating asylum seekers in a cost-effective manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have allowed for administration in recognition of higher than normal administrative costs. We appreciate that authorities are having to cope with a completely new clientele, a group for whom they have never previously had responsibility. There are also difficulties associated with dealing with people who do not speak English as a first language and, therefore, with obtaining interpreters. Dealing with asylum seekers also involves considerable liaison with other agencies, such as the Home Office, the Benefits Agency and various voluntary organisations. We recognise, too, that a considerable proportion of those who approach authorities for support are refused, but they still impose an administrative cost on authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to take the opportunity to mention the issue of cash payments, which is of concern and interest to a number of local authorities. My Department has explained to local authorities the legal advice that we have received, which states that there are no powers under the National Assistance Act 1948 or any other local government legislation to allow local authorities to make cash payments to adults receiving social care services. That means, therefore, that it would be unlawful for the Department of Health
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
to reimburse any cash payments made to asylum seekers. I trust that members of the Committee will appreciate that the decision we have taken to exclude cash payments from the grant reflected an understanding of the law on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In drawing up the grant scheme to support social services departments, the Government have applied the following principles: the grant should provide compensation for the reasonable costs incurred by local authorities in accommodating adult asylum seekers under the terms of the High Court and Court of Appeal judgments; it should contribute to costs in a way that is fair, on the basis of objective data and audited costs; and it should be clear, simple and straightforward and not impose undue administrative burdens on claiming authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have responded to local authorities' concerns by proposing the grant. I commend the report to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.40 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ann Coffey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for the clear explanation of his understanding of current circumstances. I note that he does not wish to be unfair to local authorities. Therefore, I hope that he will listen to my comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 21 February, London social services departments supported 3,500 destitute asylum seekers by providing bed-and-breakfast and hostel accommodation and meals and by dealing with personal requirements. That was a considerable burden on those local authorities. The example shows the extent of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, the circular dated February 1997, which was issued to local authorities, states that the figure of £165 was determined by considering a range of costs, from bed and breakfast, which is the most expensive option, to hostel accommodation, which is less expensive. Fifteen per cent. of the figure covers administrative costs. That is a high cost and an expensive way in which to administer an alternative benefits system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that the £144 average figure for accommodation and services was based on costs in London and the Greater London area. However, accommodation is more expensive in some areas of London than in others, because of the desirability of the area or the sort of accommodation available. For example, Westminster, as a central London borough, estimates its actual costs to be about £220 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why has not the Minister taken such variation into account? It would be simple to establish differential costs, based on the actual costs of hostel and bed-and-breakfast accommodation, or on market rent, which is used by the Rent Officer to set housing benefit. Local authorities pay housing costs through housing benefit offices. It would have been administratively cheaper to use the existing system. The cost of social security administering benefits is 5 per cent. of total expenditure compared with the 15 per cent. of the total that the Minister estimates to be the cost to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The Minister mentioned cash payments. I listened to his explanation, but I am told that such expenditure is lawful under local government powers. People are worried that the Department has ruled out cash payments for food and services and that such expenditure is not eligible for reimbursement. As the Minister knows, that leads to silly predicaments. It is much cheaper to give people cash to buy groceries than for local authorities to buy groceries on their behalf and incur the additional cost of delivering them, or arranging for meals on wheels to deliver services, thereby possibly depriving an elderly person of that service. The silliest example that I heard was that an asylum seeker who wanted a toothbrush could not be given the necessary 65p to buy it; a social worker had to buy and deliver it. What is the Minister's response to the point that, under general local government powers, local authorities can provide cash payments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to draw the Minister's attention to the cost of services to people who have exhausted the immigration appeals procedure, but who remain in this country. The legal standing of such people is complex as the issue of a deportation notice does not impart illegal status and the immigration and nationality department may take months to enforce the notice. There is no prospect of destitute persons leaving the country by their own efforts. Social services will be expected to pay the costs of continued services until the removal of the person from the country. Does the Minister accept that that is the reality? Will he arrange to reimburse local authorities for the costs incurred, in recognition that the National Assistance Act 1948 gives them those responsibilities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted the Minister's assertion that the Government would appeal to the House of Lords and I wanted to raise the point that the current arrangements are confined to 1996–97. What arrangements does he propose to make in 1997–98? Irrespective of the outcome of the appeal, there will be a delay before it is heard, and we are nearing the end of March and the beginning of the new budget year for local authorities. Has the Minister taken that fact into consideration? Will he extend the current arrangements until the matter is settled by the House of Lords?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A remarkable piece of cost shunting from the social security budget to local authorities has been achieved. local authorities have effectively been made a benefit administration agency, at much higher cost—which has thrown new light on the Government's proposed role for local authorities as enablers. Perhaps the expected White Paper will allow local authorities to subcontract back to the Benefits Agency, which could certainly administer benefits more cheaply than social services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Warren Hawksley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halesowen and Stourbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will detain the Committee for only a
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
few moments. Most members of the Committee probably received a briefing from Westminster council, as I did. It was interesting. However, I do not want to deal particularly with whether enough money will be provided. I want to pursue another matter, which the authority has legitimately raised. I appreciate that the Minister may not be able to reply to the questions that I shall raise, many of which involve the Home Office rather than his Department. If that is so, I am sure that we shall understand if he writes to us with the answers later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authority raises the question of the number of asylum seekers. In its letter it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Even when the appeal has been turned down, this is not the end of the story. Asylum seekers who have exhausted all appeal processes should not legally be in the country. However, while deportation may be the official procedure, there is little evidence to suggest that this is enforced. In an answer to a Parliamentary Question to the Home Office in October, it was pointed out that a total of 142 people were deported in August 1996. This bears no comparison however to asylum application refusals, which in the first nine months of 1996 amounted to 23,395. The remainder are illegal residents but if they are deemed vulnerable, or have children, local authorities must provide for them."</p></blockquote>
Local authorities will have to provide money in that respect and I am concerned that such large numbers of people should still be in this country, as a burden on local authorities, when, under the law, they should have been deported. Another cause of particular concern is that the Home Office last year raised the idea of putting out to tender the escorting of deportees out of the country, and that tenders were invited and applied for. What happened to that tendering procedure? I gather that those who tendered heard nothing. It looks as if the whole idea has been put on hold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the numbers of people concerned and the large amounts of money that local authorities must pay for people who the courts of this land have decided should not be here, will my hon. Friend explain why the Home Office is not doing more to reduce the burdens on local authorities, so that the present measures might be partly unnecessary, and the cost would not fall on this country's taxpayers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.49 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Gapes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ilford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister responds, perhaps he would clarify his remarks about the number of asylum seekers in the country. He gave the impression that numbers had drastically reduced, but did not refer to people who are here with exceptional leave to remain, not having been given full asylum. I know from my constituency that there are many people who it is thought should not be removed from the country because they would not be safe, but whose cases the Home Office has taken years to resolve. Others have been given leave to remain and it may take years before they are granted asylum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My local authority, Redbridge, is an outer-London borough. Despite that, a number of asylum seekers live there. Many are from Somalia and Zaire. There are people from Angola and Kurds from Iraq. They all come from areas of conflict and awful human rights abuses. The situation from which they have come is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
serious. I know of people who have waited seven years for a decision about their case. My worry is that if there is an acceleration of that process, we may find that deportations are being proposed at a time when the children of those families are well settled and established in local schools. Some of them will have been born in the United Kingdom. That raises complex issues for local authorities that have to deal not only with those aspects, but which, through their education departments, deal with children in the education system. We must consider also the possible consequences for them.

If local authorities have to face increasing financial demands we need to ensure that they receive the necessary support. Tonight, my local authority will set its budget. It is an extremely difficult process and the authority is going through hell because it has three political groups with no overall majority. I suspect that when it makes its decision, millions of pounds will be taken out of the budget and council tax increased. Those authorities with additional expenditure—even for a few people—that is not fully reimbursed by the Government will face considerable difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to be told what the position will be in the coming financial years. These measures relate only to 1996–97, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Ms Coffey) pointed out. We want to know what is to happen and when the matter will be considered by the House of Lords. Is there an implicit assumption that the Government will get their way—that Westminster council will win? On past record, that cannot be assumed. Local authorities require certainty and the ability to plan. Although the measures, limited though they are, are welcome, they do not resolve the longterm problem for many London boroughs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise a small practical point. I assume that local authorities have been fully informed on the matter and have the necessary forms. The report is being approved by the Committee today, 4 March, and the forms must be sent in by 14 March. I assume that the necessary administrative procedures were undertaken when the document was laid before the House, otherwise I cannot see how local authorities can comply with that condition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Stephen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Shoreham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am willing to support this necessary special grant. Although the standard spending assessment system allocates additional money to the inner-London local authorities by virtue of some of the special responsibilities that they must discharge, sometimes the SSA is insufficient and a special grant is necessary. I accept that this is one such case because local authorities are having to provide for people who, in the main, are in-country adult applicants. They are the very people who Parliament decided last year would not receive benefits for very good reasons. They have not come into this country by mistake.

When they arrived they persuaded an immigration officer first, that they were entering as a tourist, a business man or as a student; secondly, that they had return air tickets home; and thirdly, that they had the resources to support themselves while in this country. Many of them have now said, "Sorry, that may have been what we told the immigration officer, but it is not true. We are here as refugees. We are asylum seekers and we demand that you support us." Parliament decided that they would not be supported.

The costs that have been imposed on the local authority of the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes) have been imposed not by Parliament, but by the judges in the October case to which my hon. Friend the Minister referred. The use of judicial review causes, and will continue to cause, serious constitutional problems. The judges can decide cases only on the evidence that the parties to the case wish to place before them. They cannot consider the wider issues involved, not least of which is where we are to find the cash to pay for the responsibility that the court imposes on us. Those are matters that ought properly to be resolved in Parliament, and they were resolved in Parliament. We had a long debate and considered all the issues. It is quite wrong of the judges to stretch the wording of the 1948 Act essentially to flout the expressed wishes of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Lady started by making a plea for a variation of the amounts of money based on the variety of costs. I am afraid that, as I said in my introductory remarks, that is not acceptable to the Government because we wanted a policy that was straightforward, simple to administer and did not place undue financial burden upon the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady may be interested to know that Redbridge, for example, has calculated that its weekly costs per person are £164. Kensington and Chelsea, a local authority that adjoins Westminster and is similar in its social mix and accommodation breakdown, is having to pay £119 per week per person. Hammersmith and Fulham, another inner-London borough, is paying £150 per week per person. Ealing is paying £90 per week per person. We believe that through the consultations that we had with local authorities, the voluntary sector and other interested parties, we have got the balance right. This is the right
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
way forward to provide an amount of money that is reasonable to meet the costs, but is not cost-ineffective and inefficient to the taxpayers for whom we all have ultimate responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also mentioned cash payments. All I can say is what I said in my introductory remarks—the legal advice that the Department has received is that it is unlawful to make cash payments under the legislation to which I referred and under other legislation to which she referred. At least one local authority has received contrary legal advice, which is often the case. It becomes a field day for the lawyers. Our advice is that it would be unlawful for cash payments to be made and on that basis we are not prepared to allow them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady spoke about the time after a deportation order comes into effect and asked who would pay then. Again, I am afraid that there is a legal dispute about that. We have received advice that, once a final deportation order has been issued against someone and he has exhausted his rights of appeals, he is unlawfully and illegally in this country. There is then no responsibility on the public purse to finance that person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not mean that a local authority cannot continue to fund the person's place in this country until he leaves. However, the authority will not be reimbursed because our legal advice is that a person in that position is in this country illegally. However, the legal advice given to some authorities differs from our legal advice. I hope that the hon. Member for Stockport finds that information helpful. We are seeking to set up a meeting between local authorities and the Home Office in the near future to discuss that matter further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Stockport and for Ilford, South asked what would happen after the end of this financial year. They correctly identified that the money covered the period from August 1996 in some cases—and from October 1996 in most—until March this year. My officials are in discussion with local authorities about the costs that they will incur from providing services in 1997-98, especially in light of the Court of Appeal's decision of 17 February this year. When the discussions are complete, we shall be
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
in a better position to announce our plans for the funding arrangements for next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Halesowen and Stourbridge (Mr. Hawksley) mentioned a number of points, but he kindly prefaced his remarks by saying that they were primarily matters for the Home Office. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving me that cop out. I shall certainly ensure that he receives a reply to his specific points that are the responsibility of my colleagues in the Home Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point that my hon. Friend raised is within my remit. He asked what the Home Office was doing to speed up the removal from this country of those people who should not be here. My hon. Friend will be aware that the 1996 legislation was designed to change the appeals system and to produce the investment, which is beginning to appear, for additional hearing centres and more special adjudicators for appeals. That means that it is possible to deal with more cases of removal in a shorter timespan than has hitherto been the case. In addition, we have made changes to administrative procedures so that travel documents are sought at the earliest possible opportunity. That will ensure that failed asylum seekers may be removed as soon as they have exhausted any rights of appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) asked whether local authorities are aware of the contents of the report. I can reassure him that they are. We have a series of meetings over a considerable period of time and have worked with local authorities on the best way to deal with the problem of adult asylum seekers. The report will have come as no surprise to local authorities and I am confident that they will be able to complete their applications in the relevant time scale. For all those reasons, I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
