Draft Property (Northern Ireland) Order 1997</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Sir John Wheeler)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Property (Northern Ireland) Order 1997.</p></blockquote>
The order was laid before the House on 24 February and it largely implements the recommendations in part I of the final report of the land law working group of 1990. It provides a new statutory scheme for the redemption or buying out of ground rents in Northern Ireland. With the buying out of ground rents goes the enlargement or conversion of long leases and free farm grants to fee simple freehold titles. I know that Northern Ireland Members have received correspondence from their constitutents urging legislation on the issue.<br><br>
The land law working group considered ground rents and pointed to the complexity of pyramids of title of various fee farm grants and long leasehold estates under the fee simple. Complex titles are particularly complicated in some areas of Belfast. Pyramids of title were seen as one of the main stumbling blocks to the operation of the earlier Leasehold (Englargement and Extension) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971. That legislation involved the service notice on all the superior owners in the pyramid, with applications to the Lands Tribunal in default when all the interested parties were not traced. It was often an expensive and uncertain process enlarging, say, a 999 year lease subject to a £10 annual ground rent to a fee simple freehold.<br><br>
The working group sought a new, relatively simple scheme for the redemption of ground rents and enlargement or conversion of leasehold estates and fee farm grants into fee simple freeholds. It was based on a system of notice by the rent payer to the rent owner and counter notice by the rent owner, culminating in a certificate or redemption as the basis for the discharge of the ground rent and the enlargement or conversion of the rent payer's title to fee simple freehold. In addition, so as to move towards the fee simple ownership, the group recommended compulsory redemption of dwelling houses before sale. The working group further recommended a prohibition on the creation of future fee farm grants and long leases.<br><br>
There are various refinements of the working group's recommendations in the order. Indeed, we have taken on board most of the points made on consultation. We have brought into the order a provision derived from another of the working group's recommendations for the enlargement of long leases
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
when there is no ground rent payable. To allow for the move from leasehold to freehold title on the direction of the order, we have included new provision for the running of freehold covenants as between successors in title. This is a simple order and I commend it to the Committee as useful legislation that will help to simplify land ownership in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jim Dowd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation; he made everything patently straightforward. About the only words he did not use in his opening speech were "fee-fi-fo-fum".<br><br>
I read the land law working group report—and very revealing it was, too. I have only two questions, the first of which the Minister answered in part when he referred to the purpose of the order. My other question is why does the order have to come into force now? I accept that it would have to at some time, but the land law working group reported in 1990—to considerable effect. Its report was some 1,760 pages long, spanned three volumes and cost £75, which I am sure, even at 1990 prices, was not a best seller. The entire second volume was taken up by what I believe to be the genesis of this order, although that ran to 673 pages, with 253 articles, 16 parts and 10 schedules, compared with the 73 pages, 52 articles, five parts and five schedules in the order. Will the Minister confirm that even though this is a considerably slimmed-down version of the working group's recommendation, no significant or material element has been lost?<br><br>
In dealing with its remit in the late 1980s, the working group recommended further legislation and submitted drafts covering issues such as ground rents, commonhold, landlords and tenants, succession, consequential provisions and enduring powers of attorney and consequential provisions and enduring powers of attorney and consequential amendments. Will the Minister say whether those delights are still waiting somewhere down the legislative track, or whether it is felt that this measure deals with all those points? If all those points are covered, I should be interested to know why a comparatively slim volume has managed to emerge from more than 1,700 pages worth of work.<br><br>
I have a fairly dubious opinion of all lawyers, and I suspect that when we allow them to design proposed legislation, they tend to put together instruments that are to their convenience rather than the public's convenience, so that they can earn considerable sums of money in courts explaining to everybody else what is meant. The language in this order is not necessarily technical or opaque, but when matters are not readily comprehensible or written in everyday language, I usually suspect that something is going on. I want to be convinced that this is not another part of the lawyers' money-making machine, the major beneficiaries of which are lawyers, rather than the public.<br><br>
I understand that the order relates only to domestic property and that commercial property is not included. There is an emerging problem in Great Britain—I am not sure how prevalent it is in Northern Ireland—in the relationship between leaseholders and freeholders. The increase in service charges is almost uncontrolled and people are buying freeholds so that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0328">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
leaseholders can be charged not only exorbitant service charges but uncontrolled and uncontrollable repairs and service fees, which create great difficulties for many people in leasehold properties. Will the order deal with that problem, if it exists in Northern Ireland?<br><br>
It is difficult to object to an order of such patent common sense and reasonableness, so I shall not, but I should be grateful for the Minister's response to my questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd) for his generous support of this modest little measure. He is right to point out that when lawyers get their hands on a simple matter, they make it exceedingly complicated. That is especially true in property law—both freehold and leasehold. The law in the island of Ireland goes back to the 18th century, and this modest little measure will repeal legislation that goes back to the old Irish Parliament, which was abolished in 1800, apart from subsequent amendments to the law in the 19th century. I apprehend that the Committee would not wish me to dwell upon 18th and 19th century amendments to property law but to continue to assert and commend this modest proposal for the Committee's approval.<br><br>
The working group published its report in 1990. It was considered right that wide consultation between Northern Ireland lawyers and such bodies as the Law Society of Northern Ireland and other important institutional groups including, among others, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, continue. All had careful, long-considered opinions to present to the Northern Ireland Office before we dared to bring our modest proposal before the Committee. The order was finally published as a proposal on 20 June 1996, and we invited comments by 20 September. These came, as we might suppose, and were absorbed into the order.<br><br>
I was asked whether there will be further orders. I predict that there will. Early in my parliamentary service, in 1983–84, I was called on to serve on the Nugee inquiry which considered service charges and leasehold reform, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. The Committee was chaired by Mr. Edward Nugee QC, the leading silk in property law. I learnt from those many months of experience that the law on property is exceedingly complicated; it goes back to before the period of common law in 1196. I cannot promise that no further amendments will be made but I do not envisage there being any on this issue. As far as I can judge, the measure will not bring into play the point made by the hon. Member for Lewisham, West about service charges applying in Northern Ireland: on the contrary; in a simple way, it will get rid of an irritant that costs people money.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p>4.42 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the order, as well as being able to co-operate in it by contributing many of the points raised during consultation. I do not have a legal background. I was approached last week by a constituent representing a club in my area. He complained bitterly that an estate agent in my constituency had bought out the lease on many properties, including those owned by a district council, for £500—the only sum bid at auction. He was most aggrieved that within a matter of months, the club had to pay the princely sum of £5,000 for a slight variation on property to which the club owns the rights. I fail to see anything in the order that would give a glimmer of hope to my constituent as to how he should seek redress. It seems a great pity that tenants and occupiers are not given first option to acquire and buy out a lease when the opportunity occurs. It would be helpful if something could be done, perhaps by way of a future amendment, to ensure that a speculator is not able to buy, and then exploit a tenant.</span></p>
<p>4.44 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will reply briefly to the hon. Gentleman. It is correct that the order, the scope of which is narrow, does not address the mischief of which he complained. If it attempted to do so it would be exceedingly controversial. If a financial interest is taken from one person and given to another, surely controversy and debate will follow. I suspect that the issue that the hon. Gentleman raises would require the attention of a detailed Bill to be considered under the normal procedures on the Floor of the House and in Committee, so that hon. Members could argue for or against the proposals. That is for the future; it would be a substantial undertaking in terms of the law of Northern Ireland, and could not be dealt with in a simple order such as we are considering this afternoon.<br><br>
