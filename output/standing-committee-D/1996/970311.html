Special Grant Report (No. 26) (House of Commons Paper No. 326)</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Sir Paul Beresford)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Special Grant Report (No. 26) (House of Commons Paper No. 326).</p></blockquote>
The report sets out the basis for the provision of financial support to the London borough of Tower Hamlets, Manchester city council and the Greater Manchester police authority in respect of the cost to those authorities of dealing with the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on London docklands and Manchester.<br><br>
Hon. Members will share my deep regret that the report has been necessary. We were all appalled by the cowardly IRA bombing of docklands last February, which brought the ceasefire to an end and caused widespread damage and tragic loss of life. The equally atrocious attack on Manchester city centre in June was another cynical outrage which showed that there were no depths to which these criminals would not sink.<br><br>
Both areas face an immense long-term rebuilding task, and the Government are paying their share. We have announced £6 million of additional estate action funding for the Barkantine estate in Tower Hamlets, which took the brunt of the docklands blast. We have also made £2.6 million available to the London Docklands Development Corporation for repairs to roads and pavements and for assisting the police and Tower Hamlets in providing closed-circuit television coverage to give greater security to everyone in the area. A similar sum has been provided to the docklands light railway for repairs to South Quay station, which serves businesses and the local community. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister recently announced that the Government would provide up to £43 million over the next three years, in addition to the £20 million of European funds announced last year, towards the cost of rebuilding Manchester city centre.<br><br>
We recognise that Tower Hamlets, Manchester city council, and the Greater Manchester police authority incurred substantial costs in the months following the attacks in clearing up the streets, safeguarding damaged and dangerous property and providing support and assistance to the affected communities. The two councils also suffered loss of income, directly or indirectly, as a result of the incidents.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
All three authorities applied for help with those costs under the Bellwin scheme of emergency financial assistance to local authorities. Under that programme the Secretary of State may set up a scheme of assistance where an authority has acted immediately in response to an emergency, in order to safeguard life or property or to prevent suffering or severe inconvenience to local residents. Grant is paid on eligible net expenditure above a threshold. The Bellwin scheme is usually invoked following exceptional weather emergencies such as flooding and storm damage.<br><br>
We considered the applications carefully and found that the nature of the costs resulting from the Docklands and Manchester bombs did not sit easily with the statutory constraints on the Bellwin scheme. The relevant primary legislation—section 155 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989—permits financial assistance only in respect of
<br><blockquote><p>"expenditure on, or in connection with, the taking of immediate action".</p></blockquote>
This ruled out assistance in respect of loss of income, which formed a substantial part of Manchester city council's claim, or even small-scale permanent capital works such as replacing windows.<br><br>
The statute also restricts our capacity to consider paying grant on all but the most immediate expenditure. However, the scale of the blasts and the resulting dislocation of activity caused relief effort to be unusually protracted. We found that after deducting the relevant thresholds none of the authorities would have received much, if any, assistance under the Bellwin scheme. We felt strongly that in view of the exceptional nature and scale of the incidents, the authorities should not meet those costs unaided. We therefore decided to use our powers under section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 to make assistance available to the authorities in the form of a special grant. The purpose of the grant is to provide support towards expenditure incurred as a result of dealing with the aftermath of the terrorist attacks and towards loss of income incurred as a consequence of the attacks.<br><br>
As everyone in the House will be aware, resources are not unlimited, and we have had to cash-limit the total amount of grant payable. Nevertheless, up to £2.5 million will be made available. The actual amount payable to each of the three authorities will be determined once we have received their audited claims. The report, however, sets out the basis on which those calculations will be made.<br><br>
In determining the manner in which grant payments are to be calculated, we have taken into account the representations that we have received from the three authorities. Annex A to the report sets out what we believe to be a fair and affordable basis for establishing each authority's entitlement to the grant.<br><br>
Grant will be payable on relevant expenditure and income loss above a specified amount, equivalent to 0.075 per cent. of each authority's standard spending assessment. The specified amounts are far lower than the thresholds that would have been applicable under the Bellwin scheme, which was originally anticipated as being of use to the local authorities.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Sumberg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bury, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend will know, many traders in the centre of Manchester have lost a great deal of money as a result of the terrible bombing there. Many of them were not insured so their trading losses were not covered, and the damage to their businesses and their families has been irrreparable. Is my hon. Friend able to offer them any comfort or financial support as they struggle to overcome what was an horrendous event for Manchester and for them in particular?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his point. I shall pick it up in my explanation. The special grant is not the only source of funding. Manchester has a Lords Mayor's fund that will also help. That fund has reached a sizeable sum.<br><br>
The report defines relevant expenditure in a way that enables us to pay grant on additional uninsurable expenditure which was necessarily incurred by each authority in the six months following the two explosions as a direct result of responding to and clearing up after the incidents. The authorities will be able to claim for additional expenditure incurred to provide relief, to carry out works to safeguard life or property, to alleviate suffering or to prevent severe inconvenience. Such costs include, for example, the additional costs of clearing debris, evacuating people from dangerous structures and making those structures safe, providing emergency accommodation, supplying food and other key services to affected communities and counselling people affected by the explosions. Grant on relevant expenditure will be paid at the rate of 85 per cent.<br><br>
The authorities will also receive some recompense for uninsurable losses of income where the loss, such as the loss of rental income, is directly attributable to the explosions or where it is indirectly attributable to the attacks. For example, Manchester city council suffered indirectly from loss of income from its city centre car parks when, in the aftermath of the explosion, fewer people visited the city centre. Given that the estimates of loss of income will always be subject to considerable uncertainty, grant on such losses will be payable at the lower rate of 42.5 per cent. I remind the Committee that such assistance would not be given under the Bellwin scheme.<br><br>
We are not paying grant in respect of insurable costs or insurable losses of income. It would be wrong to undermine the operation of the normal insurance market in respect of those costs. It has long been the Government's policy that prudent individuals and organisations, including local authorities, should make proper arrangements for insurance and consider the need for the insurance that is available. We are not prepared to bail out those organisations that fail to take out adequate insurance, including insurance against terrorist damage.<br><br>
When commercial reinsurers withdrew from the terrorism insurance market in 1993, the Government stepped in and set up the Pool Reinsurance Company Ltd., which is known as Pool Re, to ensure that everyone had proper access to full terrorism cover. It would be unfair on those who took advantage of those arrangements if we compensated those who, for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
whatever reasons, chose not to. Of course, we recognise that insurance policies normally carry an excess, and the special grant arrangements make allowance for that.<br><br>
To avoid double counting with other grants and subsidies—police grant, for example—costs for which other grants have been or will be made, or for which credit approvals have been or will be issued, are not eligible for special grant under the report. Grant will also be net of any receipts to the authorities from charges levied for the provision of goods and services.<br><br>
The amount of grant payable to each authority will be calculated, in the manner described in annex A, once we have received their claims. Those claims will, of course, be subject to audit and the report stipulates a deadline of 30 September 1997 for receipt of audited claims. We recognise, however, that some time has elapsed since the explosions in docklands and Manchester. Meanwhile, all three authorities have had to meet considerable costs in the present financial year. We therefore propose to make a payment on account to each authority of 90 per cent. of its estimated entitlement to special grant under this report before 31 March. Any necessary adjustment will be made in 1997–98 on receipt of authorities' audited claims.</span></p>
<p>10.41 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stretford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to place it on record from the outset that Manchester people acknowledge what the Government have done in respect of the atrocity in June. However, the IRA's bombings of Manchester and, before that, London, were attacks not on specific locations or cities but on the whole country. That is important, because I want to make a central case about the allocation of funding following the terrorist outrage. Even now, Manchester has not been treated fairly by the Department of the Environment. It is up to representatives of Tower Hamlets to make their own case in that regard.<br><br>
The Minister gave the game away when he said that resources were not unlimited. That does not mean that the damage does not have to be paid for. The Minister's remark really referred to the Government's cash limits on what is to be made available. They have told the citizens of the city of Manchester that it is up to them to pay the balance.<br><br>
The Department of the Environment has operated in the matter that we are considering with a remarkable lack of candour. In a press release issued on 13 January, entitled "Special Financial Assistance to Manchester and Tower Hamlets Following Terrorist Attacks", the Secretary of State was quoted as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"In view of the exceptional nature and scale of the incidents, we propose, without prejudice to the review of Bellwin … to make support available to those affected by way of special grant under section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988."</p></blockquote>
I recognise that the Government have moved on from Bellwin, and that what is on offer today is better than what would have been available through strict application of Bellwin. That would have been even more outrageous than what we are now discussing, because Bellwin was not designed to deal with the scale and type of atrocity committed by the IRA in my city.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0405">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
The Secretary of State continued, in the press release:
<br><blockquote><p>"Authorities' entitlement to special grant payable under the report will be subject to audit, but, in view of the time which has elapsed since these incidents we propose to make advance payment to authorities of 90 per cent. of their estimated entitlement, with an adjustment after audit."</p></blockquote>
That percentage gives the impression on a casual reading—even by a Member of Parliament—of a very good initial offer. The cold figures are considerably different. Manchester estimates that it will incur losses of about £3.5 million.<br><br>
The Secretary of State refers in the press release to the availability of less than £1 million by way of support to Manchester. That means that Manchester citizens will pick up the bill for £2.5 million, all of which expenditure will be a direct result of a national atrocity which happened to take place in that location. That is simply not fair. The Minister said that resources were not unlimited; what he meant was that resources were not unlimited from the Government, but he expects the citizens of Manchester to find the resources for what the Government will not pay for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sumberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will confirm, on the record, that if there is a Labour Government in the next month or two, they will make up the shortfall to which he referred in respect of the city of Manchester.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Sumberg) makes a helpful point. He is a distinguished former councillor in Manchester and I hoped that he would be more helpful to the city, especially as some of the costs of the bomb have fallen not only on people living in Manchester but on the hon. Gentleman's Bury constituents: traders, for example, and those who pay council tax to fund the Greater Manchester police force. They, too, will have to pick up some extra costs.<br><br>
It would have been better if the hon. Gentleman had said that the Minister should be more forthcoming, rather than asking me a hypothetical question which I am not in a position to answer.<br><br>
I can, however, say something simple to the hon. Member for Bury, South: my constituents will pay, one way or the other, either as taxpayers or as council tax payers. There is no question of the money not being paid. The hon. Gentleman may think that he asked a clever question, but it was a remarkably silly question. I am asking only whether it is fair that the burden of an appalling atrocity, which was directed at all of us, should be placed on one community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sumberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is unfair is to criticise the Government for the lack of resources provided to the City of Manchester, to say that there is a shortfall and then to refuse categorically to give a commitment for the future. It is all very well to criticise—the hon. Gentleman may have a legitimate point—but not to follow it, so close to the election, with a commitment to do better is to mislead the people of Manchester. In reply to my first intervention, the hon. Gentleman
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
attacked me, as he is entitled to do, but he declined to answer the question. It was not a clever question but a simple one and it requires a yes or no answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman fails to understand that the money will be paid. The Labour-controlled council of the City of Manchester is doing the work and absorbing the cost. There is no question but that it is being done by a Labour authority. It is not being carried out by the Government on behalf of the nation. The question for the Minister is how he can justify the robust language of the Secretary of State about 90 per cent. of the cost being found when in reality it is only 28 per cent. That is not acceptable to people in Manchester, who will be told that they must pay for the whole thing. That is specifically and deliberately unfair.<br><br>
I am surprised that the hon. Member for Bury, South did not say, in defence of his constituents, that it was unfair that they should have to pick up the extra funding of the Greater Manchester police. Perhaps he is not concerned about his constituents at that level. If he wants to explain whether his constituents should bear that extra cost I shall give way. I am sure that he will answer the following question: should the constituents of Bury, South have to absorb the burden of a national event?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sumberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do a deal with the hon. Gentleman. I will answer his question about my position if he will answer the question that I put to him a few moments ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is saying that he accepts that the Government will not help his constituents and that that is fair; but it is not fair. It is not right and proper that the Government should pretend that they will fund the costs when they are not prepared to make the money available. Limited as resources are in the grand scheme of things, we are talking about a relatively small amount of money for the Government, although the impact on one city is high. That is why the costs should be absorbed nationally. I am surprised that the hon. Member for Bury, South does not want to defend his constituents and will not give me a clear answer to my question. People in Greater Manchester might resent the fact that the hon. Gentleman wants to make the debate into an exercise in parliamentary point scoring rather than addressing a serious issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sumberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being most unfair. He legitimately criticises the Government on behalf of his constituents, but bearing in mind that we are within weeks of a general election, the hon. Gentleman must say exactly what his party would do in Government. It is unacceptable for him to dodge that question. As he is criticising the Government, the people of Manchester are entitled to know what the Labour party would do. The hon. Gentleman constantly dodges that question by attacking me. I ask him again if he will answer yes or no to the following question: will a Labour Government put their money where the hon. Gentleman's mouth is?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0406">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not, because I do not speak for my party on the environment, any more than the hon. Gentleman speaks for the Government. It will be on the record that the hon. Gentleman has failed to support his constituents.<br><br>
I want to develop the argument rather than to continue with the parliamentary froth—[<i>Interruption.</i>] Does the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Banks) want to intervene?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are getting out of order and out of control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir John. The Minister must concentrate on the issue. If I am right in saying that the City of Manchester will absorb costs of £3.5 million, of which on £1 million will be funded by the Government, that is very different from the figures given in the Secretary of State's press release on 13 January. It is important that the Minister clarifies the position of the Department of the Environment on the matter of funding.<br><br>
There are two reasons for the present position. First, the arbitrary decision has been made to use six months as the time limit within which claims for recompense can be made. The City of Manchester will absorb a considerable amount of additional expenditure incurred well outside the six-month time limit, which expired on 15 December 1996. According to evidence from the city council, bomb-related additional expenditure incurred after six months will be about twice that on work undertaken within the six-month period. In the Government's scheme, therefore, it will not be possible to consider compensation for huge amounts of necessary extra expenditure on the basic structure of a modern city, which includes, for example, street lighting and the highway system. The hon. Member for Bury, South should consider the effect of that expense on his constituents and on mine. There is a deep sense of injustice that in a city that is the centre of a conurbation, the citizens of one area should have to fork out for facilities that are enjoyed by everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Day <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cheadle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I make a short intervention—all interventions should, of course, be short. The hon. Gentleman attacks my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South, saying that he has not stood up for his constituents. I remind him that before these exchanges my hon. Friend made an intervention in the speech of my hon. Friend the Minister which was aimed directly at defending the interests of his constituents whose properties were damaged and their businesses destroyed by the bomb. My hon. Friend is not guilty of not looking after his constituents' interests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the charge is not proven; the hon. Member for Bury, South defends some of his constituents, but not all. I agreed with him when he intervened in the Minister's remarks. It is a pity, and ironic, that the hon. Gentleman tries to make party politics out of a matter on which, as representatives of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Greater Manchester, we are known to make common accord, but perhaps it is in the nature of the pre-election fervour in which we find ourselves.<br><br>
A considerable amount of the city council's expenditure will, as a result of the nature of the major fiscal damage in Manchester, fall outside the six-month time limit. The same applies to costs that the city will bear on account of loss of income. More than half—no, about a third—of costs will fall beyond that limit, so they will be outside the compensation scheme announced by the Minister this morning.<br><br>
The other factor is that, althouth the Government propose a large amount of compensation for additional expenditure, they have decided to treat loss of income as qualitatively different. Specifically, additional expenditure will attract grant of 85 per cent. so long as it falls within the six months, while lost income will incur grant at only half that rate. That is significant for Manchester. One of its greatest losses of income—the largest single factor—is from car parks. The city council told me that it acted prudently in insuring car parks against the threat of physical damage from terrorism through the Pool Re scheme. The council even took out optional denial of access cover to protect from the risk of loss of income due to temporary closure. But it will not possible—it is not under any insurance scheme—to obtain cover against subsequent loss of attraction. The Minister is pulling a face. Perhaps he will clarify whether that point is the cause of the problem. The point may seem technical, but a great deal of money rides on it. I do not wish to be argumentative, but perhaps the Minister can do more than pull a face. I should like a detailed response as to who should pay if income has to be sought from elsewhere.<br><br>
If the centre of Manchester continues to lose trade due to the closure of shopping facilities, people will go elsewhere to shop and its car parks will not be used. That will result in a significant loss of income well beyond the six-month limit. All in all, the city of Manchester will end up paying almost £2.5 million that the Government will not provide.<br><br>
Party politicking aside, we are debating a serious issue. We all agree that the bombing was an outrageous attack on the integrity of our nation rather than an attack on the people of Manchester. They resented it deeply, as, ironically, did the Irish community. I attended the opening of the Manchester Irish festival on Sunday. All speakers from the Irish community made it clear that they did not see the bombing as an act of freedom on behalf of the Irish community. They resented the bombing. I was also gratified to hear Mrs. Kennedy Smith, who is the American ambassador to Dublin and a Irish American from a well-known family, denounce it in clear terms. Like everyone else, the American Government do not believe that the IRA, which is a military force, has a role in Britain or elsewhere.<br><br>
The atrocity in Manchester was a national outrage. Had it taken place in Belfast, Derry city or anywhere in the north of Ireland, compensation would rightly have been fully funded by the Government. However, we must recognise that different rules apply in England

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
and that, under the scheme that the Minister has described, my local authority and the people whom I represent will have to find a high proportion—almost three quarters—of the bill. That is not fair. We can bandy arguments about fairness, but central Government appear to be washing their hands of the consequences of terrorism and placing the responsibility on local communities. That is not acceptable.</span></p>
<p>11.1 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sumberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a brief speech because I know that the Committee wants to move on.<br><br>
I agree 100 per cent. with the hon. Member for Stretford (Mr. Lloyd) about the bombing. It was an outrage and an attack on Manchester and its citizens. It took place on a Saturday morning and, by the grace of God, no one was killed. Many families were in town that day and it was a miracle that no lives were lost. I endorse all that the hon. Gentleman said about the bombing and about the dreadful and diabolical nature of the attack.<br><br>
I should explain my interest in the matter. I was previously a councillor in Manchester and I have a long connection with the city, where I practised law for many years. I now represent the people of Bury, South, who are not citizens of Manchester. Of course, they have a close affinity with it, but they do not live within its boundaries. The hon. Member for Stretford is a representative of the city of Manchester and is rightly here to defend its interests, but I am here to protect the position of my constituents. Although I welcome whatever money will come to Manchester to help rebuild it as a city of the north-west, by main concern is my constituents. When the hon. Member for Stretford accuses me of not defending their interests, he shows a lack of knowledge of the geography of the north-west that surprises me. He has lived in the area all his life and should know it far better.<br><br>
Many of my constituents are concerned about the loss of income to their businesses, and I made that point to my hon. Friend the Minister in my earlier intervention. Many people who live in my constituency trade and work in Manchester. They lost a great deal of money as a result of the bomb. My hon. Friend the Minister is right to say that they should have insured themselves, but many of them are in a small way of business—for example, some are market traders—and they are not wealthy people. Therefore, outgoings are a serious problem for their businesses. As they have not been able to trade for some time, they have lost a great deal of money.<br><br>
It is important for the Government to help. They have already done so by contributing to the Lord Mayor's fund, and I appreciate that. The hon. Member for Stretford and I were at a meeting with my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister a few months ago, and I urged the Deputy Prime Minister to increase contributions to the Lord Mayor's fund so that it could be used to compensate those who had suffered losses as a result of this dreadful outrage. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will think about that suggestion and make recommendations. I know from talking to many constituents that they have lost a great deal and that that has seriously affected their families.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Day</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I associate myself with all that my hon. Friend has said. I have many constituents whose circumstances are similar to those that he described. Many people in his constituency and in Cheadle trade in Manchester. Will my hon. Friend consider, and perhaps point out to my hon. Friend the Minister, that many of those who were not insured were not without any insurance policy at all? Often, they were insured for everything except a terrorist attack. I should not want the Committee or the Minister to gain the impression that those people were irresponsible and had not obtained insurance against those risks for which it would be commercially sensible to have cover.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sumberg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point and it is true that most such people were insured but had not taken the terrorist option, as it is called. Therefore they were left in the predicament that I have described. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minsiter will take that point on board.<br><br>
A final point arises—although I do not want to labour it—from my little exchange with the hon. Member for Stretford. It is unacceptable in politics today, and particularly with regard to what we are discussing, for any party to criticise Government expenditure four or eight weeks before a general election and then to decline to say what it would do in power. The coming election will be about such issues. A microcosm of that debate has taken place here today.<br><br>
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are united on the subject of the bomb and the outrage that it represents, but the hon. Member for Stretford based his speech almost entirely on criticism of the Government for not providing sufficient resources centrally to compensate the citizens of Manchester, and for placing the burden on that city's council tax payers. It is therefore unacceptable for him to complain that I have introduced party politics into the debate and, more important—I do not really care what he says about me—for him to decline to make any commitment on behalf of his party. He says that he has no authority to do so, and he is right, in that, although he is a Front-Bench spokesman, he is not a Front-Bench spokesman on the environment. However, I imagine that the Hon. Member for North-West Durham (Ms Armstrong), who leads for the Opposition in the Committee, will catch your eye, Sir John, and repair the loss caused by her hon. Friend. She will no doubt ensure that the citizens of Manchester know exactly how much additional money a future Labour Government will commit to deal with the bomb outrage of eight months ago.</span></p>
<p>11.8 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition would answer the hon. Gentleman's question if he would concede that there will be a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0408">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
Labour Government in a few weeks. That might be a very pertinent question to put to the Member for Bury, South. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Strangers are not allowed to take documents from the Table.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing an appalling outrage. Some of the worst injuries were suffered by members of my trade union, the Manufacturing Science Finance Union. I know from my contacts how appalling some of the injuries were and how many years of plastic surgery at least one of the injured will have to endure.<br><br>
I want to concentrate my remarks on the role of the insurance industry. Despite the exchanges that have taken place, clearly, neither the traders, people and city council of Manchester nor the Government have a bottomless pit of money. However, we should focus our attention carefully on how to deal with such circumstances in future. Some people were uninsured. Some eventualities are uninsurable. The House has not got to grips with the question.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stretford is right to say that we have introduced a special regime in the context of similar atrocities in Northern Ireland. That raises the question whether we should simply designate such an approach as a function of government, or perhaps ask the insurance industry to examine more carefully some of the risks that are currently considered uninsurable. Despite what the hon. Member for Bury, South said about some small traders, it is difficult to accept a case for having no policy at all. However, the high cost of premiums would make the businesses of an awful lot of people uninsurable, if all-risk cover in circumstances such as we are discussing were contemplated.<br><br>
There is a strong case for the Government to bring together the principal players in the insurance market and representatives of the local authorities associations to discuss the way forward. Bellwin was created for one set of circumstances, and the Government have recognised that special arrangements are necessary in the present case. However, is it right to continue dealing with such matters on an ad hoc basis? Would it not be more sensible to discuss, with those parties that I have suggested and perhaps others, a way of proceeding that would coincide with the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford that it cannot be right that the people of Manchester or Tower Hamlets should bear the burden of an attack on this nation by a gang of thugs?</span></p>
<p>11.12 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hilary Armstrong <span class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Durham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. I was anxious that conditions in Manchester should be discussed, as they were, by one of the Members of Parliament for the locality, my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford. However, the order relates not only to Manchester but to Tower Hamlets. The bomb there was the first of those that we are considering, so Tower Hamlets has progressed further through the stages of recovery and replenishment of local services. Both authorities'
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
resources were inevitably stretched after the bombings and I expect that the Committee congratulates them on the remarkable way in which they tackled the problem. The bombing in Tower Hamlets happened at a weekend and we saw on television how well the important job of clearing up was undertaken, so that some people could get to work and others could carry on living in their houses, following almost instantaneous repairs. My hon. Friends the Members for Stretford and for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) have described a similar response to the bombing in Manchester. Despite the host of difficulties that form part of the everyday work of both those authorities, they responded remarkably to an appalling catastrophe and deserve the Committee's thanks and congratulations. They were determined, in working as they did, to show the IRA that it could not be supreme and that life would go on.<br><br>
I have talked to both authorities about this measure and about their experiences since the bombing. I visited the site in Manchester and saw the regeneration. The work was being done at a pace that most people said was unrealistic, but it will still take a long time. They did not believe that the work could be done so quickly. I talked to an architect who was amazed at how quickly things had moved in Manchester and at how the authorities and the private sector had worked together to ensure such speedy progress. I know that the same is true in Tower Hamlets.<br><br>
The special grant report introduces a new formula to deal with specific events such as the bombings. Terrorism on this island is an issue that we all wish that we did not have to face, but clearly we do, and until there is real peace in Northern Ireland the possibility of atrocities will continue. The formula has not been exposed to the test of time and I reserve judgment about whether it will withstand it. It is important for the nation as a whole to be able to say with confidence that we shall respond to any threat to the security of any people on this island. Is is therefore important that any agreement made by this House is made in the knowledge that we may have to revisit it because we have not got it right or we are not responding in a way that gives local communities that confidence. We shall realise this as the months pass and the authorities and this House will have to consider that.<br><br>
In Northern Ireland the formula changed several times as a proper response to outrages committed there. We, too, may have to rethink the formula in future years. If we do not, it will be because we found the answer—peace in Northern Ireland. Until that day comes, the House will have to bear the burden of examining properly how to respond so that local communities do not feel that they have been left exposed by the House or that they may have to pay the price of terrorism because the House is not prepared to adjust its funding arrangements.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
<p>11.18 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All members of the Committee will echo the key part of the comments of the hon. Member for North-West Durham that the solution to this problem is the defeat of terrorism in Northern Ireland, and in all parts of the United Kingdom. There is a general feeling of outrage in this country—I include Northern Ireland. The feelings of people on the mainland about the bombings have been illustrated clearly here today. The damage to people's lives is accepted and understood—a topic to which I will return shortly.<br><br>
What is important is that we have reacted sympathetically; today we are discussing one small section of that reaction. This point was made by my hon. Friends the Members for Bury, South and for Cheadle (Mr. Day). They spoke of having to balance that reaction with the response from people in the rest of the country, upon whom the liability falls. We, and no doubt the Opposition, accept that. However, Opposition Members did not answer the question from my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South, which hardly comes as a surprise, but it does make the point emphatically. The response can be seen in the rest of the figures that the Government have put forward.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston took a sensible approach, as did the hon. Member for North-West Durham. We must always review, learn and move forward. The local authorities' initial response was based on the Bellwin scheme, which turned out not to be appropriate. We were prepared to be flexible and to consider not only the funding from other areas, but emergency funding, which we are discussing today. It has to be seen in that context. That said, we are still looking at the Bellwin scheme, along with the local authorities.<br><br>
Discussions with the local authority associations are currently under way; a paper was considered by the Government local authority group that met last January. We are looking at the paper put forward by the local authorities and at further options. The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston suggested that we think again about insurance. We are already doing that and that is why the Pool Re arrangement was set up in the first place. The Department of Trade and Industry has already announced that it is ready to discuss the Pool Re with the local authority associations, but the local authority associations have not responded as yet. No doubt with a bit of stimulation we can get them to do so.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stretford was a little more aggressive than one would have expected, in view of the considerable amount of money that has been provided, particularly for Manchester. He talked about the press notice. One of the reasons why it was, as he claimed, misleading, was that he did not read it all out. The press notice referred to paying for 90 per cent. of the estimated entitlement, which makes the position a little clearer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will see the exact words that I used in <i>Hansard.</i></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will look back at that, but it is worth re-emphasising that the press notice clearly stated that this report, which is one aspect of the funding that is going in, would provide 90 per cent. of the estimated entitlement.<br><br>
Much was made of the loss of income from the car parks. As someone who has served in local government, I was a little surprised to find that Manchester city council owned the car parks. I suppose that one could put that down as a commercial risk, but many local authorities have accepted that car parks are probably more appropriately run by the private sector. That said, and in the light of the fact that any income is speculative or uncertain, the Government have accepted that some element of this should be paid, and 42.5 per cent. of the estimate is the proportion payable.<br><br>
We must also recognise that what we are talking about today is only a tiny bit of what is going in. Since the bomb, Manchester city centre has received £300,000 towards the Lord Mayor's appeal fund, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South and I referred earlier. The Fund will provide hardship relief, especially for businesses. I understand that the fund is rising rapidly and is now up to £2.4 million, supported by the businesses in the area, too.<br><br>
In addition, with English Partnership, the Government have provided another £300,000 towards the cost of the competition to select an urban design team to plan the city centre rebuilding. Some £20 million of the United Kingdom's share of the European structural fund for 1997–99 has been allocated to Manchester; £1 million of funding has been given for technical assistance to support the task force; £500,000 of European structural fund and European regional development fund money has been put in.<br><br>
On 10 February 1997 the Deputy Prime Minister announced that the Government would contribute £43 million over the next three years towards the task force and the costs of rebuilding the city centre. Many other small-scale regeneration funds are going in. Similar amounts apply to Tower Hamlets, where staggering amounts of money were and will be put in.<br><br>
The report is the Government's imaginative response to a request for a specific amount of emergency funding from both local authorities. The Bellwin scheme, under which the authorities applied for funding was not appropriate, so the Government considered other means of assisting them. The report deals with emergency aspects of the problem. Normally, an emergency claim must be made within two months, but—even though we recognise that longterm expenditure is not involved—we have extended that period from two to six months because of the unusual nature of the problem. It was, I thought, bad taste to have a dig at that proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In all walks of life questions of bad taste or aesthetics are matters of subjective judgment. I shall leave decisions on good and bad tast to the Minister, but we may differ on what they may involve in whole areas of life.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0410">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
The point at issue is not good or bad taste. The point is that two thirds of the additional expenditure will fall outside the six-month time limit. It is a simple rule that it takes a long time to deal with the aftermath of a big bomb. Buildings cannot be demolished in the normal way, but have to be dismantled piece by piece. That takes an awfully long time. The work of restoring Manchester cannot be done within a six-month period. Does the Minister accept that almost £1 million-worth of the additional work cannot take place in that time limit?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman, rather than displaying bad taste, does not understand that the Bellwin scheme, which stimulated the report, applies to emergencies. the normal period of two months for an emergency has been tripled to six.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
The hon. Gentleman has also failed to take into account all the other support that is being provided. I listed all the support that is going into Manchester. If the hon. Gentleman reads <i>Hansard,</i> he will see what is available and that the biggest contribution will be £43 million.<br><br>
The report deals with the tiny emergency aspect of the expenditure that follows on from the Government's quick response. It will provide emergency funding that substitutes for what might have been provided under the Bellwin scheme. I commend the report to the Committee.</span></p>
