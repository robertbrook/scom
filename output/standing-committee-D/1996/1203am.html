<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Staffordshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. I wish to give the Under-Secretary of State an opportunity to clarify her answer to a question—reported in column 187 of the <i>Official Report</i>—which I asked during last Thursday's sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am listening to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not hear the column number.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Column 187. I said that we needed to see the report, the study and the figures to which the Under-Secretary of State referred. I specifically asked for a copy of the report. I think that she misunderstood my request and thought that I only wanted to see the figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not really a point of order involving the procedures of the Committee, but I am sure that the Under-Secretary of State has listened attentively to the hon. Gentleman and will have heard his request.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mrs. Cheryl Gillan)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. There is no report or study. As I said in the same column of <i>Hansard,</i> the hon. Gentleman would not expect me to do his work and analyse all the figures. I am sure that he is capable of analysing the performance tables. I hope that that clarifies the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Lady and the hon. Gentleman have heard what each other has said. I cannot allow that matter to go further; it is not a point of order.</span></p>

<p><i>Amendment moved</i> [<i>28 November</i>]: No. 113, in page 3, line 5, after '259A.—(1)', insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'Where an area has not been designated by an order made under subsection (4A) below'.—[<i>Mr. Kilfoyle.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 114, in page 3, line 6, after 'school', insert 'in that area'.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 208</span>
<p>No. 115, in page 3, line 7, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) The Secretary of State may by order designate for the purposes of this section any area in England and Wales specified in the order (whether conterminous with the area of any local education authority or not).</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4B) Where an area is so designated, then in relation to any grant-maintained school in that area, section 259 shall apply.'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Kilfoyle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Walton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: During the previous sitting, I referred to the fact that the Department for Education and Employment estimates that there are 883,155 surplus places. Given that figure, a relatively modest redistribution of pupils in favour of one or two schools could significantly undermine the position of several neighbouring schools. As we know, schools can swing in or out of fashion for a variety of reasons not always linked to the quality of education that they offer. The status of schools can change.<br><br>
Surplus places are generally removed only by the rather cumbersome process of school closure and amalgamation, which is normally highly unpopular with the parents of pupils in the schools involved. There is a legion of examples of where that has happened much to chagrin of local parents.<br><br>
The slow, lingering decline of undersubscribed schools, which often become trapped in a vicious circle of declining pupil numbers and a consequent reduction in resources, must be a damaging experience for the pupils and staff, many of whom have little or no real opportunity to move elsewhere. It is not a process to be encouraged lightly.<br><br>
The introduction of a mechanism to allow grant-maintained schools to expand without proper regard to the potential impact on either surplus places or neighbouring schools could have a negative effect in some areas. Ironically, that might be particularly so in areas with a high concentration of grant-maintained schools because of their greater potential for uncontrolled expansion. We need look no further than certain areas of Kent for examples of that phenomenon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall argue that the amendment is not necessary for several reasons. All schools already have the freedom to make non-significant enlargements. If, under the new provisions, a grant-maintained school expands its premises by 50 per cent. when there are surplus places in the area, there is likely to be an opportunity for rationalising provision in other schools. Allowing that to happen without so much central control will help make the system more responsive to the parents' wishes. If there is no demand, there will be no reason for the school to expand. We are confident that governors will look carefully at the demand for places before deciding whether to invest time, effort and capital resources in providing them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that in the circumstances he described there is likely to be rationalisation of surplus places in the area. Who does he expect to carry out that rationalisation?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0215">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 209</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would depend entirely on the circumstances. The parents will probably carry out the rationalisation: if they send their children to expanding popular schools rather than to rotten schools, the rotten schools will close. The ultimate authority for rationalisation is parental choice, which I would have thought even the hon. Gentleman might strain to approve of occasionally—although I sometimes wonder.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recall telling the Committee that he accepted that, if there was to be choice, there needed to be some surplus places in the system. In the vast majority of cases, there is likely to be a reduction in the number of places in less popular schools, but that reduction will not be sufficient for those schools to close. Does the Minister agree that that will considerably increase the financial burden on those schools, which will add to the total cost of the education system?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, nor do I agree that the hon. Gentleman's analysis holds up. There may be an element of truth in it in some circumstances, but there is no certainty that it will happen in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests.<br><br>
I was about to quote a remark of the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), whom I like to quote occasionally, as he knows. Last Thursday, in an intervention on the excellent speech of the hon Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle), he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I appreciate that the number of surplus places is large, but in the contexts of school size, flexibility and choice, does not there have to be some surplus in each local education authority area so that parents can make a choice?"—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 28 November 1996; c. 202.]</p></blockquote>
I could not put it better. We now have a warming consensus spreading throughout the Committee; I sense it even as I speak. We all acknowledge that, for parental choice to be exercised and for popular schools to be able to expand, there will inevitably have to be what may be defined as a surplus—in simple terms, the number of school places will be greater than the number of pupils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for being so generous as to quote those illustrious remarks. Given that he has some responsibility for English education, what does he believe to be an acceptable level of surplus places, a level at which the Government might ask an authority to consider the number of places in its schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly reasonable question to which I am slightly reluctant to give an absolute answer—but let me try. We have in mind, as a working figure, about 10 per cent. of places. I was going to cover the matter in my speech, which I shall probably plough through anyway. Hon. Members keep interrupting, but my officials have, as usual, anticipated their questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: He always says that.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 210</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that I always say that, but it invariably turns out to be true. The Committee will know that, when I keep to the text provided for me, it answers all the questions that Opposition Members ask. If they want to anticipate, I shall give the answers twice, although I do not want to put anyone off.<br><br>
The answer to the question of the hon. Member for Bridgend is about 10 per cent. That will vary according to local circumstances, but we believe it is reasonable to allow for an element of expansion and flexibility and for the parental choice on which we place such great importance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister understandably makes great play of our commitment to flexibility in the system, but how does he account for the wide variations between local education authority areas? The matter obviously depends very much on the concentration of surplus places; for instance, Barking has 3 per cent. of surplus places in the secondary sector and Lambeth has 37 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The straightforward answer is that it depends on the competence of the local education authority. I do not particularly want to comment on the competence of individual authorities—unless pressed gently. However, it is self-evident that a number of authorities have been assiduous in trying to deal with excessive surplus places, which are an expensive educational overhead, whereas others—perhaps also owing to a natural underlying rapid growth in pupil numbers—have been able to reduce or even almost eliminate surplus places. It will depend on the underlying demographics of an area and on the assiduity with which the LEA pursues surplus places because it regards them as an expensive educational overhead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister also agree that it depends on the assiduity of the Department for Education and Employment in determining whether resources should go to LEAs to take out surplus places? For example, 37 per cent. of Lambeth's secondary places are surplus and it was given £50,000 last year. Next year it has been promised absolutely nothing. Was that determined on the basis of need?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious that if I am not careful, Sir Michael, we might be in danger of straying from the subject. The direct answer is that I would be astonished if inner London education authorities were short of money in any way whatever. One of the persistent features of education in recent years has been the enormous sums of money that have been received per pupil—usually, it is related to appallingly bad educational performance. Any suggestion that Lambeth is short of money is laughable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I now give way to the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge), who will doubtless tell us about Islington.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0216">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 211</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he was reluctant to mention individual authorities, but the authority that I represent, Barking LEA, has a good record. Is not the Minister therefore simply agreeing with the Audit Commission, which recently made great play of the enormous amounts of money being wasted on surplus places? Is he saying that the Audit Comission is wrong?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is conceivable that the Audit Commission might occasionally be wrong. I have never thought that the Audit Commission shares the attributes of the Pope—or of any other deity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. Is it in order to refer to the Pope as a deity rather than as his representative on earth?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister heard the hon. Gentleman's point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Sir Michael, to His Holiness and to the hon. Gentleman. I am straying into an area in which I am not at all expert.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be a good idea if we keep to the amendment rather than call in aid the opinions of other extremely eminent people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more, Sir Michael.<br><br>
The answer to the hon. Member for Barking is that although I would not say that the Audit Commission was infallible or that all its views were absolutely correct, it is at one with the Government and apparently with the Opposition—and probably with the Liberal Democrats as represented by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)—in identifying excessive surplus places as being an undesirable educational overhead that unnecessarily absorbs education money. However, we all recognise that a degree of excess of school places over the number of pupils at any one time is desirable because it gives flexibility for all the reasons that we discussed earlier.<br><br>
The fact that I have answered the hon. Lady's question probably means that I shall not have to use some of the excellent material that I have in my hand. We have covered most of the points that have been made and I do not want to detain the Committee unnecessarily.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Minister that I shall not quote him in any discussion on theology. But with regard to his comments on the expenditure levels of the inner London education authorities, I do not think that he can complain because his Government abolished the Inner London education authority on the specific grounds that they would save money by doing so. His Government are responsible for the system, so they should examine the expenditure and see whether their original predictions have come true.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more. If I am to have the support of the hon. Gentleman for a harsh review of the allocation of money to inner London education
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 212</span>
authorities, I am delighted and I welcome his support. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman knows in his heart of hearts that if his local education authority received anything like the same amount of money as boroughs such as Southwalk, Lambeth and Islington, he would be over the moon. On that unexpected note of harmony and agreement, I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If, indeed, in terms of flexibility, the 10 per cent. figure were to be acceptable, we have already achieved it, given the total number of surplus places. But it misses the point that there is a concentration of surplus places in certain areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That proves why I should not stray from my text. One of the points that I should have made, if I had stuck to it, is that in 1994, there were just over 1 million surplus places—12 per cent. of primary school places and 14 per cent. of secondary school places. That fell to 883,000 in 1995—the figure that the hon. Member for Walton correctly gave the Committee a moment ago—leaving 11 per cent. of primary places and 12 per cent. of secondary places unfilled. So, we are not quite there yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the Government are not quite there, but they are obviously aiming in that direction to get the figure to around 10 per cent. If uncontrolled expansion is allowed, especially in the grant-maintained sector, the only direction the figures will go is up, as pupils are drawn from surrounding schools. On that basis, we shall press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put.</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 135, in page 3, line 5, at beginning insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'() This section shall have effect after the making of an order under section 3(2) of the Education Act 1997.'</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No 136, in page 4, line 2, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2) The Secretary of State may by order bring the provisions of section 259A of the Education Act 1996 into effect, but no order may be made before the Secretary of State has (after consulting local education authorities and such other persons as appear to be concerned) conducted and published a review of the operation of regulations relating to the size and standard of school premises.'</p></blockquote></span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Earlier this year, many members of this Committee were also members of the Committee that debated the Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained Schools Bill. They will recall the lengthy consideration we gave to the need for adequate physical space in providing high-quality nursery education. It is relevant to tell members of the Committee who did not sit on that previous Committee that that was another example of a deregulatory exercise by the Government. The Government proposed to remove the long-standing requirement that premises used for the education of children below statutory school age should allow a minimum of 2.3 square metres for each child. Opposition Members were extremely concerned by the removal of that safeguard which, with the various commercial pressures that were introduced as a result of nursery vouchers, we believe could result in publicly funded nursery education being provided in inadequate premises. I argued strongly that such a move was in breach of—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall happily give way when I have finished my sentence. I argued that it was in breach of the United Nations convention on the rights of the child to which this country signed up in 1991.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To help the Committee, could the hon. Gentleman tell us the column number of <i>Hansard</i> where he is reported as deploying that argument?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The Minister has a team of staff who can do that research—as her colleague was telling Opposition Members a moment ago. I am sure that the hon. Lady recalls my argument. If it is helpful to her, I can tell her that I made it around 9 or 10 March, because those dates tie in with the date of the press release, which I happen to have with me, that I issued following the sitting of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was much later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says it was much later. I was obviously able to issue press releases in advance of my contributions in Committee.<br><br>
Article 3 of the UN convention on the rights of the child states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In all actions concerning children…the best interests of the child shall be of primary consideration…State parties shall ensure that the institutions, services and facilities responsible for the care or protection of children shall conform with the standards established by competent authorities."</p></blockquote>
I stress the final few words:
<br><blockquote><p>"the care or protection of children shall conform with the standards established by competent authorities."</p></blockquote>
This country has signed up to that convention and we must ensure that the relevant clauses of the Bill are amended so that we live up to it. Without accepting the amendments, we cannot do so.<br><br>
We have moved on since the passing of the earlier legislation. The Bill provides further deregulatory measures which will, as the Minister will accept, allow schools to open nursery classes without having to go through the process of publishing proposals and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 214</span>
acquiring formal approval from the Secretary of the State. Not only is there no regulatory safeguard relating to the amount of space per child allocated by a school for nursery provision, but the possibility of the Secretary of State taking that allocation into account before approving arrangements for expansion is specifically excluded. We must be concerned about that.<br><br>
During the passage of earlier legislation, there was agreement that quality was of the utmost importance in the provision of education for young children. I am sure that most members of the Committee would agree that the adequacy of premises is an important aspect of ensuring high-quality provision of education. The Bill will remove the safeguard of having to consider the space allocated to children when a proposal for nursery education is made. We should reconsider providing a form of control on the adequacy of such premises.<br><br>
I could have introduced an amendment that attempted simply to reinstate the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1981. Instead, I chose to present to the Minster an amendment that I believe she is likely to accept, since it poses no significant problem for the Secretary of State. The amendments do not go as far as reimposing a formal space limit but require that the Government undertake a serious review of the effects of having removed the regulations. If that review reveals that the removal has produced results that give cause for concern, there would be a strong case for the reintroduction of the earlier regulations. However, if it finds that there is no need for that reintroduction—and no doubt the Minister will argue that everyone acts responsibly and that the space and facilities provided for young children are everywhere entirely adequate—we could proceed with further deregulation. The Government should first satisfy themselves that damage to children's education will not ensue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You will be pleased to hear, Sir Michael—as I am sure will all members of the Committee—that I do not intend to rerun the Committee stage of the Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained Schools Bill; nor will I recall the mean-minded attitude of Opposition Members when I was trying to help them by tabling papers with manuscript amendments, or repeat the full debate that we had on the school premises regulations on 18 March, in which the hon. Member for Bath participated for a couple of minutes.<br><br>
The amendments are unnecessary and irrelevant. They are unnecessary because grant-maintained school governors are perfectly capable of making sensible decisions about the size of their schools, whether or not we review the regulations. They are irrelevant because the school premises regulations are about setting minimum standards, not about the day-to-day management of schools or the number of children in individual classrooms. We revised the school premises regulations this year, eliminating much that was bureaucratic and inflexible, but retaining the minimum standards that count—those that safeguard the health, safety and welfare of pupils

and protect the playing fields that schools need. Before the new regulations were made, my Department took a long, hard look at the old regulations and consulted schools, LEAs and other interested bodies. Whatever their individual concerns, almost everyone agreed that change was needed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is now telling us that all those who responded said that a long, hard look at the existing regulations was necessary. The Minister may know that, but other members of the Committee do not. Will she confirm that she refused to make available to the Committee or to the House the results of the consultation on the 1981 school premises regulations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We had 119 responses—only 7 per cent. of the schools and organisations consulted—which was a very low response rate. As I said, before the new regulations were made, my Department took a long, hard look at the old regulations. At the time, the Opposition made a considerable fuss about the removal of minimum teaching area requirements. They said it would lead to overcrowding in schools and larger class sizes, and I can only assume from the amendment that the same old fears are surfacing again.<br><br>
The Opposition are making two mistakes. First, they assume that school governing bodies cannot make the right decisions for their pupils' benefit without a straitjacket of bureaucracy. Yet, over the years, our policy has been to trust school governors with more and more responsibility, which has paid dividends. They have shown themselves to be more than equal to the challenge of running school budgets and dealing with staffing, the curriculum and other vital issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify what she said about the Opposition making a fuss? Will she tell us whether she is reading that in a brief that has been prepared by civil servants?</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am referring to the Committee stage of the Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained Schools Act 1996, when the Opposition made a considerable fuss—including the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), who chipped in from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Lady made the comment, she appeared to be reading from a brief. Will she tell us whether that brief says that the Opposition made a fuss and whether it was prepared by a civil servant?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite nosey about wanting to know what is in my notes. These notes are extremely helpful and as my hon. Friend the Minister of State said earlier, our officials anticipate most of what the Opposition will bring up, so from time to time I refer to my notes. It is of no interest to the Committee who wrote the notes or where the words that I say come from.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 216</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The issue is the partiality or otherwise of those comments. It would, therefore, be useful if the Minister would tell us whether the notes say that Opposition Members made a fuss.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If this is a thinly disguised attack on officials, I am having none of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gravesham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do Opposition Members expect us to believe that my hon. Friend the Minister needs the help of civil servants to rubbish the Opposition's very weak case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was an extremely helpful intervention from my hon. Friend—I shall continue to rubbish the Opposition.<br><br>
The Opposition's second mistake is to assume that removing strict legal controls will automatically mean bigger classes. The old regulations said nothing about class sizes; just for the record, I remind members of the Committee that we have had no statutory limits on class sizes in England since they were abolished. Guess who abolished them? It was a former Labour Secretary of State, Mr. Edward Short, back in 1969.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister can tell, there is considerable interest in her contribution. Is she prepared to lay the papers from which she is reading in the Library?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that there is no pressure on me to lay any papers in the Library. Perhaps the hon. Lady would like to do that with her notes.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. This is a most important point. I wonder whether you can give a ruling, Sir Michael, on whether the Minister has an obligation to place her papers, which appear to have been prepared by civil servants, in the Library? Does the Minister have a duty to do so, if required?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Advice that a Minister receives from officials is a matter for the Minister involved. They are not official papers that must be placed in the Library.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Michael. The Opposition cannot accept that school governors know what is best for their schools. With access to good advice, governors can get it right for themselves, whether that is appointing a new head teacher, setting a budget or increasing pupil numbers. To help them make decisions on accommodation, my Department has recently published "Area Guidelines for Schools", which gives up-to-date practical guidance on teaching accommodation and school grounds, showing range of possible solutions to accommodation problems in different types of schools. That is surely a much more sensible and positive way in which to face the challenge of building up popular schools than tying governors' hands with yet more restrictive red tape. I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply was extremely interesting. In an intervention, the hon. Member for Devonport asked whether her brief had been prepared for her or whether they were her own words. However, what I found surprising and what showed that the Minister was simply reading from a pre-prepared brief was that she mentioned an issue to which neither I nor any other member of the Committee had referred. She devoted part of her speech to class sizes. I may have it wrong—and no doubt the <i>Official Report,</i> will inform me otherwise—but I was not aware that that issue had been raised. That is further evidence that the Minister was reading from a prepared brief.<br><br>
What was also surprising about the Minister's response was the number of times she told the Committee how much Conservative Members trusted school governors. She said that governors can get it right for their schools, and made other similar remarks. That was in stark contrast to the debate in our previous sitting when the hon. Lady said that school governing bodies should not be allowed to decide whether ballots should be held in secret. She tells us that Conservative Members trust school governors but, as our previous debate showed, the reality is that that is not true.<br><br>
The Minister did not respond to the wording of the amendment. She suggested that it was proposing the reintroduction of space regulations. However, if she had read the amendment, rather than simply the words on her brief, she would have discovered that it contains no such proposals. I merely proposed that, before any enlargement of nursery provision is allowed to go ahead by any school, the Secretary of State should consider whether the changes in the regulations covering school premises had been successful. The hon. Lady did not refer to that matter. Yet again, we have received a disappointing response, and I wish to press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 20, in page 3, line 10, leave out '50 per cent.' and insert '10 per cent'.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 218</span>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that grant-maintained schools follow the full consultation procedure if they increase their size by more than 10 per cent. Unlike the Under-Secretary, I do not have a brief prepared by civil servants, but I am perfectly happy to lay a copy of my speech in any library—although nobody can read my rotten handwriting.<br><br>
There are two principal arguments why this is a key amendment: the first is financial and the second relates to quality. I remind the Committee of the Minister of State's attitude in discussing an earlier amendment. I am surprised at the acceptance of what I consider to be wasted capital expenditure. One of the basic tenets of the education system since 1944 has been that we do not build unnecessary schools or create unnecessary school places. Successive Governments, both Labour and Conservative, have exhorted local education authorities to close schools when there are surplus places. The potential 50 per cent. increase in a school's capacity will create surplus places, and it is wrong that that should occur without consultation. It is important that the 50 per cent. be reduced to 10 per cent.<br><br>
The Minister said that surplus places in the system number about 12 per cent., and that he considered 10 per cent. to be about right. On a crude calculation—I admit that it was done on the back of an envelope, so advisers may want to help the Minister—I reckon that about £20 million is being wasted, on the basis that each place costs £2,800, which is roughly the standard spending assessment. I apologise if my figures are slightly awry, but that is a lot of money to waste, especially given that small expenditures, such as schools' budgets for books, could be massively increased if those moneys were redistributed.<br><br>
Each year, when we discuss schools' budgets, Ministers are quick to criticise LEAs and say that they are wasting resources. After this morning's debate, it is clear that the criticism should be levelled fairly and squarely at the Government for deliberately pursuing policies that lead to a waste of capital and revenue expenditures; the Government enable unnecessary surplus places to be created not to make educational sense but simply in the pursuit of political dogma. Ministers who attack LEAs for not making best use of their resources in distributing money to schools will have to say why they believe it proper to waste money by maintaining surplus places and, under the Bill, deliberately creating more.<br><br>
If the same argument were to be applied to hospital beds, there would not be a crisis in the national health service, which is not allowed any surplus places—there is no flexibility whatever to enable beds to be found promptly for people who, in times of crisis, have to go into accident and emergency departments.<br><br>
Let me put another point to the Minister. Given the current backlog of repairs—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sorry that he seems to be bored, as I am talking about key issues that he needs to deal with. About £3 billion worth of capital repairs currently need to be carried out. There are too many outside lavatories, for example. Two weeks ago, with other members of the Select Committee on Education and Employment, I visited several primary schools in Norfolk; some were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0220">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 219</span>
possibly in the constituency of the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, but they were all in the area covered by the local authority of which she was a member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Lady that I am capable of listening to her even if my gaze is not fixed attentively on her.<br><br>
Is the hon. Lady authorised to make a spending commitment on behalf of the Labour party to rectify what she claims to be a £3 billion shortfall in school repairs?</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to take the Minister on. The first action of a Labour Government will be to stop the wasteful expenditure that Conservative Governments have indulged in year after year. The Bill sets in concrete the idea that there should be surplus places in the system; it is yet another instance of the money that will be available to a future Labour Government to put into the education of our children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that it has been stated repeatedly by various members of the Opposition Front-Bench education team that we fully intend to address the deficit on capital repairs and maintenance through a new local form of public-private partnership? It will be outside the public sector borrowing requirement, in recognition of the fact that the private finance initiative, as it applies to education, has been a total and abysmal failure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely—I concur entirely. As one who took part in similar projects when in local government, I can say that we know more about private finance initiatives than the present incompetent Government.<br><br>
The Government's proposal to add to the number of surplus places and to incur additional capital expenditure when there is a massive backlog is iniquitous. The argument is about outside lavatories in primary schools in villages in Norfolk—that is where the money should be going. It is about putting money into repairing the leaking roofs and, equally important, ensuring proper facilities in all schools so that the national curriculum can be taught. It is about ensuring access for disabled people, particularly in the light of the launching yesterday of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.<br><br>
The Secretary of State for Education and Employment should look on her own doorstep in Norfolk; she should not be spending money on expanding schools and enabling grant-maintained schools to waste capital expenditure on new places when there is a backlog of key problems that urgently need attention if our children are to have a proper education.<br><br>
It may make it easier for the Minister if I give an example. Let us assume not that there are surplus places but that the balance is just right between places and students. If two similar schools with sixth form entry, one a grant-maintained school, have about 900 children from 11–16, about 180 pupils in each year,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
and if one school chooses without permission to expand by 50 per cent. to 1,350 pupils, the other school will have only 450 pupils because there are no other children in the area.<br><br>
I dread to think of the capital costs involved, but I know that the grammer school being built in Milton Keynes, admittedly for 1,000 children, will cost about £12 million. Let us presume that, in my example, half of that money—£6 million—is wasted capital spending. No more places are needed, so the £6 million capital spending goes down the drain, while roofs are leaking, people are using outside lavatories, there are insufficient books and no facilities to teach the national curriculum.<br><br>
That is a scandal. Not only is it a scandal that capital money should be so spent; what will happen to the school where there are now only 450 pupils? The cost per pupil for accommodation and overheads in that school will inevitably increase. I would hope that the Minister of State agreed with that at least, but I expect that he and his colleagues would immediately attack that school for being inefficient. In fact, that school has no option but to be inefficient because of the legislation that the Government has enacted.<br><br>
Not only would the cost per pupil increase, but, for example, if a school were left with 450 pupils because the others had gone elsewhere, the sixth form could be abolished as there would be insufficient children—unless they were all incredibly able—to allow the school to offer an appropriate curriculum to those 16 to 19-year-olds who wanted to stay on at school. So something else could be destroyed.<br><br>
Because of the decrease in the number of pupils and therefore the reduced income—money follows pupils, so there will be 450 fewer sums of £2,800—there will be less capability lower down the school to deliver the national curriculum to 11 to 16-year-olds. What does the Minister of State think about that? Is it common sense to introduce legislation that will waste capital spending and damage the educational opportunities of children in adjacent schools? Even sport could be affected in the school that loses pupils.<br><br>
Competition between schools will be unfair. If there is less to spend per capita because money is locked into overheads and the capital spend, if a lesser curriculum is offered, if there are fewer sports facilities and if the sixth form is lost, the competition between schools becomes distorted. Although the Government have believed in the market for so long, they are deliberately interfering with market forces to disadvantage one school in favour of another. So the proposals will yet again worsen the long tail of under achievement that bedevils the British edcuation system.<br><br>
The proposal to enable grant-maintained schools to expand their numbers by 50 per cent. is financially and educationally irresponsible. The amendment would reduce that figure to 10 per cent. before sensible consultation procedures were put in place. That is the only sensible pragmatic, educationally proper step to take to ensure that we protect the educational opportunities of all our children and do not worsen them or add to the long tail of under achievement.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 221</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the point at which the hon. Lady and I swap dogma. Apparently, her dogma dictates opposing grant-maintained schools, restricting their flexibility and freedom and protecting poor, inefficient schools because she thinks it a scandal that their pupil numbers might be reduced or that their sixth forms might disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister of State cite one part of my speech where I suggested that? Nowhere in my speech did I make that point. I should be happy for him to refer to just one instance, which I could confirm from my notes, where I made such a statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened closely to the hon. Lady and thought that it was the thrust and burden of her argument that it was somehow undersirable for a popular school to expand at the expense of another school which, as she said, was inferior—which was why parents would not send their children there. Then the hon. Lady seemed to object to the fact that a poor, unpopular school could be forced to reduce its numbers. I think that a reading of <i>Hansard,</i> which we shall all read as closely as ever, will reveal whether my interpretation of what the hon. Lady said is true.<br><br>
We estimate that the cost of a surplus place is about £800. I should be happy to give the hon. Lady more details of the calculation in writing. We work on that figure because it includes only some elements of surplus capacity and surplus places and not the full cost of a place per pupil. I am willing to write to her and give her details of the calculation so as not to detain the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister provides information about the cost of a surplus place, will he also give the cost of a new surplus place that will be created by the addition of extra capacity? The cost must be greater if new classrooms are built to provide surplus places.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall attempt to do that. However, such an issue is wide ranging. I can imagine some cases when the provision of a new place in a popular, oversubscribed school could be in a temporary classroom, for example. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) and I have probably seen many examples of that in our meanderings through the education system. Alternatively, it could be a full-blown, state-of-the-art new science or technology block, or set of classrooms. I shall attempt to explain to the hon. Gentleman what additional capacity in a popular school might be.<br><br>
We have come to the nub of the difference between Opposition Members and Conservative Members. They have a rooted objection to the idea of expanding a school if it is successful and popular and parents want to send their children there. They consider such expansion evil and undesirable, if that implies that another school that is not popular and to which parents do not want to send their children might have to reduce its size or capacity. I am happy about that process, as I suspect are my hon. Friends. But if Opposition Members are unhappy about such a prospect, that merely illustrates the divide between us.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 222</span>
I want to read to the Committee, in extenso, circular 23/94 on the supply of school places. It is a key document and it marked a significant change in the way in which the Department considered the response that should be made to the popularity of schools and the provision of places. Paragraph 12 on page 7 of the circular states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State will always consider carefully the educational as well as financial and organisational merits of proposals for the provision of new school capacity (whether through establishment of new schools of significant enlargement of existing schools), including where there are conflicting proposals from the LEA and the Funding Agency for Schools… The principal factors which the Secretary of State will take into account will include:
<br><blockquote><p>the contribution the proposed new capacity would make to increasing choice, diversity, and in particular the quality of education in the area;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>the extent to which there is a need for additional school places in the maintained and grant-maintained school sectors in the area concerned, given the need to ensure cost-effective use of public money."</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
It goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"There may be particular circumstances in which the Secretary of State is prepared to approve statutory proposals for new school places—whether LEA or GM—despite the absence of a projected shortfall of places in the area, for example where, in the Secretary of State's view, the proposed new places would significantly enhance the quality, choice and diversity of education available in that area and where there would be scope, following the approval of new places, for rationalising places at other schools."</p></blockquote>
I could not have put it better myself. Circular 23/94 has been in existence for some time; it has been quietly guiding us in the direction outlined in the Bill. The amendment would undermine that process in a crude and ideologically driven way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that the Secretary of State's approval would not be required.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is correct. As I said, the Bill seeks to build on the principles that were established in the circular to give more local choice and flexibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that clarification, but if the Secretary of State's approval is not required, the circular that the hon. Gentleman read to the Committee so assiduously is completely irrelevant. The Secretary of State may have those powers, which seems sensible, but the point is that an individual school does not need to have regard to the financial or educational reasons for expansion and does not need to seek the Secretary of State's approval.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is correct—it is the whole purpose of deregulation and of the Bill.<br><br>
The hon. Lady's analysis is yet again at fault. She is saying that the expansion of a popular grant-maintained school in response to demand from local parents will somehow starve other schools of money, while also claiming that something that sounded very like the private finance initiative would magically appear on the scene as Labour party policy to respond to the supposed £3 billion shortfall in school repairs capital. Not even the hon. Lady can so blatantly have it both ways. I am happy to join her in relying on a new infusion of private money into the education system,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0222">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 223</span>
partly to allow grant-maintained schools to respond to parental demand, but I shall not stand condemned by her accusation that if that process occurs, other schools will be starved of capital.<br><br>
I rest my case on what the circular established as a new principle, on the fact that the Bill seeks to build on that principle further to deregulate the education system, and on our publicly stated expectation that an element of private finance will come in to support expansion and to fulfil parental demand for places. The amendment seeks arbitrarily and crudely to trammel that process, and I urge the Committee to reject it.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response was astonishing and irrelevant. He totally failed to address the issue of what happens when an individual school decides to increase its numbers. Perhaps he will table a Government amendment providing that the Secretary of State's approval must be sought in such circumstances; we would all support that and Opposition Members would feel slightly happier. We would not be so worried about the educational and financial nonsense of allowing a free-for-all in which one school can choose to expand its numbers by 50 per cent., causing another school to lose its resources and thereby detracting from its quality. That is what many private sector companies do when they want to kill off the competition. I hope that we, on the other hand, will try to ensure that all our children receive quality. The proposed introduction of diversity has nothing to do with raising standards.<br><br>
I shall comment briefly on the issue of capital. The Opposition have a clearer idea of where our priorities lie than the Government; they lie not in giving £6 million to a school, as in the example I gave earlier, to enable it to expand when sufficient places are already available in the area, but in dealing with the inadequacies of capital expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may be a difference between us, and we should understand why it exists. The hon. Lady just talked about where Labour would give money, because she is, perhaps understandably, irredeemably rooted in her party's dogma that money can come only from the Government—or, as I would put it, from the taxpayer. I had thought that the hon. Lady and I were starting to agree, but we are drifting apart again in an upsetting, alarming way. I had thought we agreed that a popular, expanding school could attract private money—such as the £6 million to which she referred—and if we could get back to that common ground, her objection might disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even grant-maintained schools are state schools and I am not sure where they get their money from other than the state and the taxpayer—they are not free-standing institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should disabuse the Minister of his confusion over the PFI, especially the design, build, operate and finance model to which the Government are accustomed, and which has signally
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 224</span>
failed in education. Our proposals are merely intended to find ways of effecting a partnership with the private sector in order to raise capital for the repairs backlog, which has built up over the past 17 years under this Government. They have nothing whatever to do with the PFI.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. The Government's record in attracting private moneys to assist public purposes has been so dreadful that it is one of the reasons why a change of Government might attract better investment in our infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that the Minister's statement seemed to imply that he regarded the PFI as a no-cost option? Certainly, there is different treatment of capital raised from the private sector, but the ultimate cost of funding that capital is deferred back down the line to the public purse because grant-maintained schools are still in the public sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Committee if I make a distinction between the views of the Opposition and Conservative Members on the issue of private finance. For Conservative Members, it is about mortgaging our future; for the Opposition, it is about investing in our future. People want investment in their future, which is why they will vote for us. I shall not press the amendment to a Division because we shall undoubtedly continue the argument elsewhere, but I am astounded at the inability of the Minister, who is so ably advised by a stream of advisers, to respond to any of the issues that I have raised. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 116, in page 3, line 24, leave out 'four' and insert 'eight'.<br><br>
The amendment would increase the time frame for the proposed enlargement from four to eight years. We want to illustrate the Government's arbitrary approach to the relaxation of controls on the enlargement of premises and to probe their reasoning, as they do not appear to have any. We hope that the Government might wilt a little and reduce the effect of the proposed relaxation. The decision to set the date at
<br><blockquote><p>"four years before the date on which the governing body form the intention to make the enlargement concerned"</p></blockquote>
appears to have no logical basis. It coincides with the term of office for some governors—although not for grant-maintained foundation governors at present—but otherwise it seems to have been selected completely arbitrarily. We want to press the Government on why they have chosen that time frame.<br><br>
After "the appropriate date", as mentioned in the clause, a school will be permitted to more than double its intake, within five years, without being statutorily required to refer to any other local interests and schools. I await to be disabused of this, but a school of 500 pupils could expand to 750 in 1997, and then expand by a further 375 to 1,125 in 2002, thus more than doubling its capacity within five years.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0223">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 225</span>
If that happens as a result of this legislation, the change in capacity could not be accommodated cost effectively by neighbouring schools. The Government's proposed relaxation of controls may be detrimental to the effective use of existing resources in neighbouring schools, even without the problem being further compounded by the cumulative effect of the enlargements to which I referred. The time scale should be doubled to enable effective planning in the remainder of the schools where a notion such as effective planning is still considered a useful management strategy, despite the Government's efforts to the contrary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The direct answer to the hon. Gentleman's reasonable question is that we believe that four years is a reasonable period—it is a matter of judgement. I could equally ask the hon. Gentleman why it should be eight years, and we could get bogged down in a futile exchange, which I am sure neither he nor I would want.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May be he does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason why the amendment specifies eight years is simply that we wanted to tease out why the Government have chosen four years. I presume that we have heard the answer—they plucked it out of a hat. Apparently, there is no logical reason behind it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am duly teased. In any legislation or guidance, such matters are essentially a matter of judgment. In my experience of Government and the public sector, it has rarely been the case that there is a scientific formula on which to base such things. If there is to be a limitation at all, one must judge what would be reasonable.<br><br>
We picked a four year period because we acknowledge that circumstances in an area could change so rapidly that an eight year limitation would unnecessarily and undesirably restrict a school's flexibility to respond to those changes. That is why, in my judgement, eight years is excessively long. I am prepared to say to the hon. Gentleman that the right answer might be five years or three years; we settled on four because we think it about right, given our experience of the way in which local circumstances can change. For example, there might be a rapid growth in pubil numbers because, a large number of houses have been built in a school's catchment area.<br><br>
The reasons for our decision are no more nor less than that. I claim no scientific basis for it; I simply say that it is a matter of mature and experienced judgment—not just mine but the experts' and the Department's. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment, as I believe it would be unduly restrictive, whether intentionally or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that my question has been answered; there is no logical reason for choosing four years. We have to depend on the informed judgments
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 226</span>
of Ministers but, if the record of the past 17 years is anything to go by, that does not count for a great deal. Having said that, I do not expect that the proposals will be of any material significance because, with a change of Government, I doubt whether they—or the rest of the Bill—will come into effect. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a basic principle of sensible planning that those proposing changes to existing provisions should have regard to the costs of, and the wishes of those who are likely to be affected by, their proposals. There is nothing radical about that; it follows on from our previous debates. Local authorities, health authorities and other public bodies are required to have regard to prescribed criteria and to consult widely, giving consultees sufficient time to make their views known. I am sure that there is much case law to illustrate that principle.<br><br>
The Government recognise the need for joint planning powers to be shared between local authorities and the Funding Agency for Schools in areas where less than 75 per cent. of pupils attend grant-maintained schools. They also recognise the need for admission arrangements to be co-ordinated between grant-maintained schools and the local education authority. The amendments set out the criteria that a governing body would have to have regard to before it makes a decision to expand the school's capacity. Governing bodies of grant-maintained schools cannot be allowed to expand capacity without giving due consideration to the effect that their proposals would have on other interested parties. For example, a neighbouring school could face a sudden reduction in its intake, which could have a significant effect on the quality of education that it can offer—the school could face rapid decline.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0224">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 227</span>
When we discussed whether the time frame should be three, four, five or eight years, the Minister said that there could be rapid changes. The net effect of those changes will be felt by neighbouring schools and by the local education authority, whose capacity to plan effectively for all pupils in its area could be undermined. Likewise, the efficient use of resources could be undermined. Schools other than neighbouring schools could be affected. For example, another school in the area may be better placed to cater for that need, particularly if there are fluctuations in estimates of the child population, especially those that are imminent.<br><br>
I recall an LEA school in the extreme north-west of Hillingdon—its name escapes me at the moment—that is now undersubscribed but where planning permission has been given for a huge number of houses to be built in the surrounding area. However, if my memory serves me correctly, there is a concentration of grant-maintained schools in the extreme south-east of Hillingdon taking pupils from over the border, which has resulted in an oversubscription of school places. It seems sensible in such circumstances that due consideration should be given to the impact that such a proposal will necessarily make on other schools.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
Finally, there must be some sort of response to consultation. A parent may make a strong case for retaining a school's present capacity, but there can be arguments over other factors such as how the ethos of a school could be affected, and local accountability and security. In short, the governing body should not designate the appropriate date until it has had regard to those factors which, in our view, could significantly influence the need for a school's enlargement.<br><br>
Local education authority plans to reorganise have been frustrated by schools with surplus places opting out and becoming grant maintained. The result has been that LEAs have been forced to fund those places while simultaneously having to fund new places in other parts of their areas. We are all aware of schools that have gone down that path, notwithstanding the Government's original intention that such schools were not to become grant maintained. A grant-maintained school on the periphery of my constituency—Our Lady of Fatima school—was due to close but became grant maintained on precisely those grounds. The necessary impact of that was quite striking on schools in the surrounding area.<br><br>
The principle of wide and meaningful consultation would be reaffirmed through the amendment, although I am mindful that the Government might yet again reveal their antipathy to what we would describe as meaningful consultation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In clause 3, we seek to provide a clear set of rules that can be applied at any time by a governing body intending to embark on an enlargement of the school's premises, to enable it to decide whether the publication of proposals is necessary. The rules need to be clear and easily applied so that there is no doubt about the governing body's duty.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 228</span>
The amendments would require detailed consideration to have been given the desirability of enlarging the school premises and that that consultation had taken place before the governors could decide whether the publication of proposals would be necessary. As the consideration and consultation would take some time, there would be less chance of publication being required after all those procedures had been carried out than if the date applied at the first point at which the governors formed the intention.<br><br>
The question therefore arises of what difference the amendments would make to the thrust of the Bill. First, in carrying out the consultation the governors would need to make it clear whether it was their intention to publish proposals. The amendments would therefore lead to confusion not only for the governing body but for those being consulted. Secondly, the amendments would require analysis of the situation in relation to other schools in the area; that would go beyond what one would normally expect the governing body of a school to undertake. Such analysis would more usually be made by the LEA or the Funding Agency for Schools, and the governors would of course consider that later in the process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A few moments ago, the Minister was nodding in agreement with me about consulting parents and the considerations that might affect them—principally, the ethos of the school being somehow affected by an increase in size. How does the clause enable parents in such a situation to make their representations, other than collectively through the parent governors on the governing body?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Parents can do anything collectively that they choose. One of the main elements of accountability that we have built into the arrangements for schools is—as the hon. Gentleman well knows; he is an active participant in them—that we encourage parents to participate in their schools by attending the annual general meeting and electing parent governors and the like. Simply to dismiss that as being somehow irrelevant is rather odd, especially coming from the hon. Gentleman who takes such an interest in these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister of State accept that those who participate in the various structures that he has established well know that only a small minority of parents attend annual general meetings; go to schools when their is an Ofsted inspection, or put themselves forward for or participate in ballots for parent governors? Only a tiny minority participates in such matters, but on an issue such as this, which changes the character of schools, or that of opt-out ballots, parents take an interest. So why will the Minister of State not provide an opportunity for them to express their views on issues of importance in which, as we know from the experience of ballots, they take an interest?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0225">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 229</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first answer is that parents will have such an opportunity. Given the fact that the process is public, parents always have an opportunity to make representations directly through either their elected governors or other means.<br><br>
I am puzzled that the hon. Lady suggests that low turnouts invalidate election results. I should be interested to hear her comments on the validity of her period in Islington, given the balllots that I suspect took place during that time. If the hon. Lady goes too far down that road, she will get into considerable trouble.<br><br>
I rest my case on the availability of the mechanisms to individuals, as parents, electors or whatever. If they choose to avail themselves of those opportunities, that is fine, but I give them the benefit of the doubt and say that a considered abstention is, in itself, a statement of satisfaction with either the existing position or that set out in the consultation process.<br><br>
Yet again, the difference between the hon. Member for Walton and myself is that the Opposition want to enshrine the status quo and give the system a sclerotic nature which will make change difficult, whereas we, the dynamic, thrusting radicals who trust local opinion and parental power, want change to occur when it is educationally advantageous. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we are accused of sclerosis, calcification must be the name of the Conservative's game, given their thinking. We have tried to show the impact that the proposals will have on neighbouring schools. Is our demand to consult parents so outrageous? I do not believe so. We have explored such issues under the aegis of various Opposition amendments, but the truth of the matter is to be found in the Minister of State's clear and consistent response that, as he said at the beginning of our debates, he will not accept any of our amendments. He gave the clear impression that there would be no change, no matter how thoughtful our amendments were. That impression has been clearly reinforced in this debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret having given that impression. Apart from any other consideration, how could I possibly judge amendments that have yet to be tabled? I could well have judged the amendments of which I was aware when I might have said those words, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman would not accuse me, of all people, of prejudging the quality of Opposition amendments and suggest that I would reject them all out of hand. I will judge each amendment on its merits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State is well known for the pragmatism of his political views.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, at the end of the day, people are judged on their record, not on what they say?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree with my hon. Friend. The record hitherto has shown that the Minister of State has not been prepared to accept any eminently
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
sensible amendment such as this. That reinforces the message that we have consistently put across: there is a need to consult all those interested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To be fair to the Minister of State—[Hon. Members: "Don't."]—during the consideration of a previous major Bill, he made some important concessions on the code of practice for special educational needs. Therefore, he is probably waiting to reach the part of the Bill to which we have tabled some major amendments and then concede them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish that I had the same faith as my hon. Friend in the Minister's pragmatism. We are at a different stage in the electoral cycle and what the Minister is about is establishing that clear blue water so beloved of the Tories, and not yielding an inch. As a result, those Members in marginal seats, whether in Gravesham, Dover or elsewhere, have been given a crumb of comfort on which to fight in their constituencies. Nevertheless, we shall be returning to the matter at a later date. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 21, in page 3, line 42, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(3A) The governing body of a grant-maintained school shall submit any proposals for the enlargement of the premises of the school to the local education authority for their consideration; and no such proposals may be proceeded with if, in the opinion of the local education authority, there already exists surplus capacity within the area of the authority for pupils of the relevant age group.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 16, in page 4, line 2, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(6) Any proposed enlargement of premises under subsection (1) of this section shall not have effect unless the Secretary of State has determined that there will be no adverse impact on admissions or other arrangements of schools within a five mile radius of the school seeking such enlargement.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not speak for long on the amendment, because we have made the point before. The Minister of State said that one of the reasons for rejecting previous amendments along the same lines as the one under discussion was that consultation takes time. We accept that; democracy does take time, but surely all members of the Committee are democrats and, if we want to introduce a change, we should not be frightened of the time it takes to ensure that there is democratic consensus for such a change.<br><br>
It is extremely worrying that participation in local elections and in the governance of schools is at such a low level. The Minister's job is not simply to say that, because the structures are in place, the Government have done their job. It is the job of anyone who is committed to fostering participative democratic processes to go beyond the structure and to encourage mechanisms that ensure proper consultation and participation and, through that, proper consensus for proposals.<br><br>
Our amendments—previous ones, the ones under discussion and those to follow—are attempts to strengthen that process. By rejecting them, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0226">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 231</span>
Minister is showing himself to be a member of a Government who do not believe in consultation. Our discussions are not about individual schools; the state runs the schools. The Government wish to take to themselves the centralising power, so that they can decide which schools can expand. They want to follow their political prejudice, facilitate the expansion of grant maintained schools and attack particular LEAs as they do consistently, without fulfilling their proper role of attempting to improve standards. We argue constantly that standards should be improved for everyone.<br><br>
If the Minister were really committed to local opinion and local power—terms that he used when winding up the debate on the previous amendment—he would not be bypassing the structures that give a legitimate voice to local interests and local power. He has shown consistently throughout our proceedings that he is deeply opposed to structures that give voice to local opinion and local power. LEAs are probably the most legitimate element of such structures. They have a better democratic mandate than a governing body of any school, especially governing bodies of grant maintained schools that become self-perpetuating oligarchies, which is how the Government have established them. Their mandate reflects local opinion and local power far better than governing bodies do and, therefore, LEAs should be empowered in such situations when decisions have to be made. Consultation with the LEAs is especially important on the issue of surplus capacity. I do not want to repeat what I said, but the Minister has perhaps had time to reflect on the issue and he may want to respond. If a school has surplus capacity, how can it make either financial or educational sense to allow it to increase its capacity or change its selection procedures?<br><br>
Our amendments would provide for necessary consultation so that sensible decisions can be made. They would prevent selective grant maintained schools forcing other schools to decline, close or become less attractive to local parents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The issue is very clear and simple. The hon. Lady has now come clean and says that she believes that the democratic mandate of a local education authority is inherently superior to that of a school. That divides the Committee simply: the Opposition place their total faith in LEAs—good or bad—whereas we in the Conservative party prefer the true democracy and accountability of the school, with all its mechanisms, at community level. It is in and of the community. Through its annual general meeting, it has elected parent governors and because of all the other panoply of mechanisms available to it, it can gauge local opinion better than an LEA.<br><br>
I share the hon. Lady's regret that there is sometimes a dismal turnout in LEA elections and that in many schools there is such a poor manifestation of parental support or participation, but that is inevitable in a free and flexible democracy such as ours. We give people the opportunity and it is for them to decide whether or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
not to take it. On educational matters, I am happier for the school rather than the LEA to be the focal point of the expression of parental views.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was impressed by the Minister's paean of praise to democracy in schools. Does he intend to ensure that all, or at least the majority, of governors should be directly elected by either parents or the wider community?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a very helpful suggestion and I shall give it serious thought. The hon. Gentleman may know that the whole subject of school governance has been canvassed and returned to from time to time, not least in the recent White Paper. We took the view that rather than approach the matter on a piecemeal basis in the Bill, it would be better in the longer term for the Government to consider the whole issue of school governance to see whether changes were justified. I leave the matter entirely open and welcome the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that perhaps a greater proportion of school governors should be elected rather than appointed. I thank the hon. Gentleman for his contribution, which is helpful in our continuing review of the subject.<br><br>
We can settle the amendment simply by saying that the Government rest their case on the accountability and representative nature of schools and parents. For that reason, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fortunately, the Minister will not be in a position to do that job on governance because we shall be doing it; we shall bring some sense back to the disorder that has been created over nearly two decades. We are touching on an interesting issue. The Committee probably agrees that turnout is low for local and school elections, but I challenge the Minister and look forward to receiving any information that he has that in a school election for a governing body, the turnout reaches even the rather low level for local elections, which is about 30 or 40 per cent. Even with four children in the system, I have never been involved in an election for parent governors—or an annual general meeting, where probably only 1 or 2 per cent. of parents emerge. Although both mechanisms need to be improved, the democratic mandate on which the Minister rests his case is so abysmally weak that it has no credibility.<br><br>
Later in the Bill, we shall consider other mechanisms such as our proposal for parent-school contracts, which the Minister has adopted. This is a far better and more realistic way to get parents involved in the education of their children. Parents generally do not have a concern for the school as a whole, but for their children, who would certainly be affected by the school's enlargement or the introduction of selection. That is why they should be consulted—as should the LEA, which, like it or not, currently has the democratic local mandate required to achieve consensus for change.<br><br>
I am deeply saddened that Ministers should show a complete lack of confidence in democracy. It is their experience of the greater democracy, which we are trying to encourage, that has led them in that direction.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 233</span>
So many schools have voted against grant-maintained status that the Government want to cut out the parent. They are pursuing narrow political dogma rather than the interests of parents and children. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 125, in page 3, line 47, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) In prescribing the method for determining a school's capacity made under section (4) above, the Secretary of State shall in such regulations specify criteria which he adopts for assessing overcrowding in relation to that capacity.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to tighten up the rather sloppy language of new subsection (4). In prescribing the method of determining a school's capacity, we require the Secretary of State to state unequivocally the exact criteria for assessing overcrowding. The Bill creates ambiguity by making references to a school's capacity to accommodate pupils. It is imperative to clarify what that means in practical terms. We are familiar with the Government's view that overcrowded classrooms do not necessarily inhibit educational achievement. I wonder how far the Government would allow a grant-maintained school to grow when creaming off those judged to be of high ability and aptitude.<br><br>
The fundamental flaw in the Bill, which seeks greatly to extend selection in grant-maintained schools, is that it will distort educational provision in their favour at the cost of schools seeking to cater for those who are not selected at the age of 11. Those schools will be denied the pupils and parents who could help to lever up standards and who would provide the vital network of support and commitment to the school. Those pupils and parents will be removed to a school whose capacity is not clear.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to encourage some sensible limits on the expansion of grant-maintained schools in the interests of the schools, the pupils and the wider community, all of whom stand to benefit from ensuring that schools do not expand beyond the limits of their physical capacity at the expense—as would be inevitable—of equitable educational provision throughout the community. It is significant that the reference in this year's education Act to "significant enlargement" of a grant-maintained school has been defined in the Bill as expanding numbers by more than 30 pupils or 50 per cent., whichever is the greater.<br><br>
I understand that it was probably lawyers' advice that led to the provision for the Secretary of State to prescribe the method for determining a school's capacity. Does the provision mean—incredibly—that an increase of 49 per cent. in pupil intake could be judged as not constituting a "significant expansion"? If so, the Secretary of State's guidelines on appropriate capacity would not apply. Or was it the possibility of severe overcrowding that led the Secretary of State to reserve the power, having only recently done away with it throughout the state sector under statutory
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 234</span>
instrument No. 360 on the Education (School Premises) Regulations, which she defended vigorously in the House on 18 March?<br><br>
It is proposed that the regulations that were first introduced in 1981 and which were reversed earlier this year again be reversed, in a matter of months, with the Secretary of State again being allowed to prescribe regulations specifying the minimum criteria on pupil space, at least for grant-maintained schools. That is strange, given that it comes from a Secretary of State who told the House on 18 March:
<br><blockquote><p>"If the governors can take decisions about admissions and staffing—and they can—surely they can be trusted to take decisions about the size of teaching accommodation, recreation areas and storage space."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 18 March 1996; Vol. 274, c. 129.]</p></blockquote>
The Opposition opposed that statutory instrument, and the amendment proposes that the reintroduced regulations be made more specific so that criteria are laid down for deciding whether overcrowding exists. We seek to make overcrowding a specific consideration of a grant-maintained school's capacity, regardless of whether pupil number expansion is judged "significant". It is important that the Bill state its meaning clearly.<br><br>
I wonder whether the original abandonment of the regulations was partly a ruse to allow grant-maintained schools to borrow under the Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained Schools Act 1996, as that allowed grant-maintained schools to borrow only against those capital assets judged to be surplus—land or buildings not defined as overcrowded, as opposed to what the Prime Minister described as buildings for "core functions". Will the Minister explain why the Secretary of State has reversed a statutory instrument that she introduced as recently as 18 March, and why she is not introducing more specific measures? What the Minister has said is vague and does not make clear on what basis incapacity will be judged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillian</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, the Opposition are raising the spectre of the school premises regulations. I have no intention of rerunning the debate of 18 March or the Committee stage of the Nursery Bill.<br><br>
I was disappointed by the way in which the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) moved the amendment because I fully expected to hear his definition of overcrowding and the sensible limits that the Labour party proposes but, sadly, none of that was forthcoming.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
The Opposition cannot understand that popular schools may choose to admit more pupils than their approved admissions number when they judge that this is possible, taking account of their particular accommodation. The hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South has missed the point in many ways. The issue is not whether a school is overcrowded but how the size of the existing premises and any proposed enlargement of those premises should be assessed in order to decide whether statuory proposals need be published.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0228">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 235</span>
I could talk in detail about the Department's circulars 11/88, 6/91 and 23/94, and I should be willing to send them to the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South so that he could more precisely understand how the existing arrangements work.<br><br>
The regulations will specify that the more open enrolment formula—the method currently used to judge significant enlargements—will be used to determine a school's capacity. That method is based on the area of floor space used for teaching. The amendment would add nothing to existing provisions and is therefore unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sadly, I did not catch the Under-Secretary's eye. Had I done so, I am sure that she would have given way in her usual courteous manner before she finished her speech.<br><br>
Given the fact that the Under-Secretary said that she is willing to tell us in detail about the Department's various circulars, if she can catch your eye, Sir Michael, she might like to make another speech with especial reference to those circulars and tell the Committee what action the Secretary of State takes if any school does not abide by the advice contained in them.<br><br>
I understand that the circulars merely give advice about floor space. However, the Committee is concerned with what happens when that advice is breached, which is why the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South moved the amendment and made such an effective speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have one question for the Under-Secretary. We are not clear which regulations she was referring to. The Secretary of State said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The new regulations will no longer include prescriptive minimum areas for teaching accommodation and recreation areas."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 18 March 1996; Vol. 274, c. 127.]</p></blockquote>
Given what the Secretary of State said, it seems that a judgment must be made about the capacity of teaching accommodation that is necessary, yet that is difficult to square with what she said about the role of governors, as they might be expected to judge whether there is sufficient teaching space. However, the Secretary of State now thinks that she should make a judgment about the capacity of the school. I wonder whether the regulations include any guidance under which she can make that judgment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that I record for others our delight at the Committee's common sense in listening—for once—to the Opposition. I shall not speak at great length, as the amendment relates to ground that we have already covered, but I shall make one or two comments to pull some of the issues together.<br><br>
The Education Act 1944—the year in which I was born—established consultation mechanisms. It stated that a decision to change the character of a school had to be taken openly and publicly. The Act recognised the need for consensus among all interested parties. Under this Bill, particularly those measures relating to grant-maintained status, that long-established tradition, on which there has been cross-party consensus, has broken down. It is now being suggested—although we may vote out this clause, too—that decisions to change the character of a school do not need to be taken openly and publicly.<br><br>
The Minister may ask whether such decisions will change the character of the school. Let us consider them in the round and see how they could relate to an individual school. A grant-maintained school could increase its capacity by 50 per cent. It could change entirely from being, in effect, a non-selective school to a selective school; it could introduce several nursery classes or a sixth form. Such changes are massive and to pretend that they, either individually or collectively, do not represent a change in the character of the school is being dishonest with language.<br><br>
Ministers are becoming rather good at being dishonest with language. Let us consider their misuse of the words "diversity" and "choice" and their lack of understanding of how to improve standards. Such proposals will change the character of a school. Therefore, if we are to remain true to the spirit and letter of the 1944 Act, we should have consultation.<br><br>
I refer to the extent of the consultation process. If the character of a school is about to change, a notice must be published. Those of us who have been through such procedure know how much care must be taken with the notice. If the public notice was worded wrongly, it could mean a legal challenge. That has happened several times when authorities, husbanding their resources diligently and effectively, tried to close certain institutions. The public notice must be published in newpapers and distributed widely. There must be a period of reflection and, if people object to proposals that will change the character of a school, they can write to the local education authority or to the Secretary of State, who would quite properly in those circumstances reflect carefully on the evidence
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 238</span>
surrounding such proposals. I remember such a discussion with the Minister about special schools in my constituency.<br><br>
The Secretary of State then adjudicates, often to the irritation of the local education authority if that adjudication takes considerable time. Such a process of consultation is being thrown out by the Government, especially in relation to grant-maintained schools. The power will be left in the hands not of the Secretary of State, but of the grant-maintained schools. We are moving from accountability and proper consideration to unaccountable decisions taken by a few people whose democratic mandate is questionable and who can, by their actions, create great damage. The two amendments have been tabled to ensure that proper consultation takes place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At present, publication of statutory proposals is required only when the introduction of the selection of changes in the proportion of pupils selected would produce significant change in the character of the school. New section 265A(3) and paragraph 2(3) of schedule 2 preserve these arrangements for changes above the relevant thresholds for grant-maintained and local education authority schools.<br><br>
The amendments would introduce new procedures for changes when publication is not required. Those new procedures are more complicated than those for statutory proposals. Even if nobody objects or if the Secretary of State approves, the governing body would still have to hold parental ballot before going ahead.<br><br>
I submit that there is absolutely no need for elaborate procedures for changes that do not amount to a significant change in the character of a school. Before making such changes, governors would be required to consult parents of children at the school, the governors of neighbouring schools, the LEA and other interested parties. That is surely enough. Unlike Opposition Members, we trust the governors to behave responsibly—as we have repeatedly made clear.<br><br>
As for ballots on selection, an analogy with grant-maintained ballots is misleading. A decision to seek grant-maintained status is essentially a yes or no decision, a yes vote leading in the majority of cases to a permanent change in the school's status. It makes sense to have parental ballots on that question, but decisions on selection are more complex and less permanent. Schools can decide to introduce selection in differing degrees and in different ways—for instance, by general ability or an aptitude for particular subjects. Unless they are 100 per cent. selective, they must consider the question of selection every year.<br><br>
Decisions on selections are surely best left to governing bodies, on which parents are represented. The governors will be required to consult parents on decisions about selection but, in my submission, those decisions are not suitable for parental ballots. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>

<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to believe that increasing numbers by 50 per cent., introducing selection, bringing in a nursery class and introducing a sixth form would not change the character of a school. That is laughable. If he thinks that the amendments seeking consultation go beyond statutory proposals, he should table an amendment suggesting consultation under normal statutory requirements. He will not do that because he believes not in democracy but in political dogma. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 4, line 45, leave out '50' and insert '1'</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: </span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 13, in page 5, leave out lines 1 to 3.</p>
<p>No. 14, in page 5, line 19, after 'for', insert 'primary or'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Each of the amendments does something slightly different, but they are all related to the same question.<br><br>
Amendment No. 12 would reduce to 1 per cent. the threshold of selection where publication is required. That would make the provisions of the clause on publication and approval mandatory for all selective or partially selective grant-maintained schools.<br><br>
Amendment No. 13 would remove new subsection (6)(b), which sets the threshold at 20 per cent. for selection for grant-maintained primary and secondary schools requiring special measures.<br><br>
Amendment No. 14 would ensure that grant-maintained primary schools—including nursery provision—were totally exempt from the proposals of clause 4. It has already been said that opposition members of the Committee are opposed to selection at the primary stage.<br><br>
I shall expand my comments on the amendments in a slightly different order, which may make it easier. Amendment No. 12 reiterates well-rehearsed arguments against selection and against special measures being allowed for grant-maintained schools. In particular, I stress the importance of taking into account the effect that changes might have on other schools in the area. I am thinking especially of the impact of a school's decision to increase selection and the impact that that will have on other schools.<br><br>
Amendment No. 14 raises questions that have been discussed in debates on other amendments. It would ensure that grant-maintained primary schools would not be able to introduce selection and would not be able to increase selection without approval. The arguments against selection at the primary stage, by ability or aptitude, have been well made. I do not intend to go through them again. In summary, the argument is that selection at primary level will be an even more inadequate indicator of performance than
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 240</span>
selection at the age of 11. As has been said, young children learn rapidly but at very different rates in the early years.<br><br>
We also know that early selection would reflect less on individual ability or aptitude than on the quality of support that very young children have had in the home or, more importantly, in any early years education. Even some Conservative Members have now come to the view that early years education is important; they have joined Opposition Members in accepting that high-quality early years education will lead to a significant improvement in a child's ability. Sadly, such education will not be available to all three and four-year-olds in the near future, and any assessment for selection at primary level will necessarily be a reflection on that.<br><br>
Another point that has been raised is that selection at such an early age is likely to disadvantage certain children, such as those from ethnic minorities—particularly those for whom English is a second language. Such children need maximum support, and will not benefit from being rejected so early on. A related point, which has been mentioned, concerns demotivation; failure to be selected at that early stage can lead to a lack of motivation that will have a lasting impact on young children at the very start of their educational career.<br><br>
My final point—again, I summarise what has already been said—relates to choice. The Government keep telling us that it is important that parents have the right to choose schools, but the reality is that—be it at secondary or at primary level—the schools select the children. In some areas, especially rural areas, parents who have been denied their choice because their children were not selected through whatever the system may be, will—ludicrously—have to send their children a very long way from the local school. That will place a significant financial burden on the local education authority, which is responsible for school transport.<br><br>
Amendment No. 13 relates to the 20 per cent. threshold for schools requiring special measures to be taken. I remind the Committee that "special measures" are those required where Ofsted inspections have revealed serious problems and the schools have been deemed to be failing or likely to fail to give all their pupils an acceptable standard of education. That means that the educational standards have been deemed to show—I quote from the Ofsted regulations—
<br><blockquote><p>"low attainment and poor levels of progress",</p></blockquote>
which will be evident to the inspectors in
<br><blockquote><p>"poor examination, National Curriculum and other accredited results".</p></blockquote>
Most mainstream schools that have required special measures to be taken are in inner-city or other urban areas and serve communities with high levels of social and economic deprivation. Surely, bearing in mind the competitive climate in which schools now operate, grant-maintained schools will be tempted to resolve the identified problems not by improving their results in terms of the national curriculum and external
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0231">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 241</span>
examinations, but by recruiting more able pupils and introducing an element of selection so that the school rises up the league table.<br><br>
The Government seem to employ a strange double standard. Where a county or voluntary school is found to be in need of special measures, legislation ensures that both the LEA and the Secretary of State are given additional powers; the LEA may, for example, appoint additional governors and withdraw financial delegation and the Secretary of State can even establish an education association. Yet despite those tight controls, presumably designed to protect the interests of pupils and ensure that schools improve, the Government seem to think it acceptable to allow a grant-maintained school that is failing its pupils to change its admission procedures and select up to 20 per cent. of its pupils.<br><br>
The double standard—to which I am sure the Minister will refer in a moment—occurs in clause 7, where the Government seek the power to make regulations requiring the consent of the Secretary of State to the enlargement of a grant-maintained school if it is a special measures school. One can only assume that that is because the Secretary of State is concerned that the school should improve before a larger number of pupils are admitted. It is odd that the Secretary of State should say that it is for some reason—doubtless the Minister will tell us what that reason is—acceptable for a grant-maintained school that has been told that it is failing to increase its selection up to 20 per cent., regardless of the impact that that will have on nearby schools and without having to demonstrate to the Secretary of State that that increase would not counter measures necessary to meet the concerns expressed by Ofsted in its inspection.<br><br>
The amendments are sensible and seek to remedy some of the ills that will befall the education system if the clause is passed. I am sure that members of the Committee look forward to the Minister's response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has set out his views on those important issues at some length. I am sure that he will, characteristically, forgive me if I do not reply to each of his points in similar detail; some of the ground has already been covered. However, I shall pick up the central points he made.<br><br>
The amendments seek to challenge the principles that underpin the Bill. By proposing that, for example, primary schools should not be able to introduce selection or by reducing the grant-maintained margin from 50 per cent. to 1 per cent., the hon. Member for Bath is meeting head-on the principles on which the Bill is predicated—that both LEA and grant-maintained schools should be given wide flexibility in the light of their local accountability. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's analysis or conclusions; I do not believe that his arguments about the impact the proposals would have on the local community hold water. The hon. Gentleman seems to assume that schools, governors and parents would gratuitously take actions that would damage the existing or future school population. That is an extraordinary
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
accusation against well meaning governors and parents thoughout the land. To base an argument, as the hon. Gentleman does in a rather illiberal way, on the notion that we must assume the worst of parents and governors is extraordinary.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can see the argument that the Minister of State is trying to develop. I have given him the benefit of the doubt once or twice during the past week or two, but what was that old adage about the road to hell being paved with good intentions? Sometimes things go wrong, however well meaning governors might be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Things can always go wrong in this life. Indeed, on the odd occasion, things go wrong even in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Nothing goes wrong in this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Sir Michael. I stand corrected. The Committee's will is, of course, absolute and correct at all times. However, the Government and the Opposition disagree about what are reasonable safety nets, checks and balances, and what are not. Our judgment is that to shift the balance in the direction of schools, governors and parents—local accountability—is sensible and wise. Indeed, that accords with the arguments on decentralisation that we normally hear from Opposition Members. Is it not a paradox that Opposition Members resist the Government, who are often accused of centralising education, every time that they attempt to decentralise it? So there is a circle to be squared.<br><br>
I am comfortable with the idea that as much decision taking as possible should be decentralised and be locally accountable and driven. It is for Opposition Members to justify their stance. Yet again, they seem to argue for maximum centralisation and the maximum involvement of the Secretary of State, LEAS or whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The issue at stake is not how much centralisation there should be but the framework in which it should take place. Let us have decentralisation, but let us also have reasonable working ground rules to ensure that all schools have a fair crack of the whip.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fair crack of the whip, indeed. The amendment appears to be not a subtle attack but a frontal attack on the grant-maintained sector and the dynamic role that we expect grant-maintained schools to play in their local communities.<br><br>
I can almost completely forgive the hon. Member for Bath because his position is consistent and open. He opposes grant-maintained schools. Therefore the amendment is utterly in character and absolutely consistent with his opinions. We all know where he is coming from, and I forgive him for that because of his many virtues. However, I shall give way next to the hon. Member for Walton, who will try to explain the Labour party's attitude to the amendment.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0232">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 243</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister of State, but I was not about to do anything of the sort; I was about to ask him a question. He has twice used the phrase "sensible and wise". Given his erudition, does he recall the speech of King Archidamos to the Spartan league at the outbreak of Peloponnesian war? He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Slow and cautious may be seen as wise and sensible."</p></blockquote>
Does not the Minister of State think that if the Government were a little more slow and cautious about these precipitate changes, he would not find himself in the embarrassing position in which he found himself this morning?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I well remember the speech to which the hon. Gentleman referred. Typically, he quoted it accurately. However, the Bill builds incrementally on what has gone before. The Committee might care to consider the progression of moves that the Government have made—local management of schools, delegation of schools budgets, and the abiilty of schools to exercise their choice to free themselves from local authority control through parental ballot. All those moves have been made in the same consistent direction. The Bill will build on that and move further.<br><br>
The amendment would undermine the nature of grant-maintained sector and would deny primary schools the possibility of introducing selection. I am about to deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Bath about failing grant-maintained schools. Our view is simple. If, for example, a grant-maintained school which is deemed to be failing judged that to introduce an element of selection was one of the best hopes for restoring its fortunes, who are we to deny it that possibility?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister's brief is, as ever, thorough and meticulous, but I am anxious to have a clear answer to my question. In view of what he said, why does he believe that clause 7 is necessary? Will he explain its relevance? Perhaps I can extend my remarks briefly while the Minister finds out the answer to that question, because it is important for the Committee to hear what the Minister has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that it is to enable transition arrangements to be made, so that the move from one status to another will be as seamless as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm, perhaps without having to get a detailed briefing from his officials, that there is a difference between clause 4 and clause 7? Will he explain the relevance of the 20 per cent. difference between clauses 4 and 7?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not immediately. I cannot because we have not reached clause 7 yet, but I shall not forget the hon. Gentleman's question and will return to it at the appropriate time. I am sure that you would take a dim view of it, Sir Michael, if I were to stray into clause 7 when we are discussing amendments to clause 4. I shall not forget the hon. Gentleman's question and will deal with it in due course.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the best hope for a grant-maintained school that was failing would be for it to go selective. Would he recommend that a secondary modern school that wanted to restore or improve its fortunes go selective or comprehensive?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would be a matter for it to judge. We want schools, governors and parents to make such judgments. I am not going to say what I think would be better. The essence of the Bill is to give them choice and to allow them to exercise their judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister considers that a failing grant-maintained school could restore its fortunes by bringing in more able children, does not that apply to secondary modern schools, which could restore their fortunes by bringing in a cohort of more able children? Or does he believe the reverse—as we do—that the fortunes of many schools are depressed because they are denied some of the more able children?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, that is an unusually simplistic analysis. I am not going to prejudge what would be best for schools in different circumstances. It is perfectly possible that some schools may find that their overall performance would be improved by introducing an element of selection. That is the point of the Bill. But equally I concede that there may be circumstances when that is not the case. It is not for me to judge. The procedures that the Bill will put in place will allow such judgments to be made by a combination of the governors and parents—having consulted appropriately, and so on.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bath is seeking to subvert, pervert or constrict the arrangements in a rather arbitrary way. I believe that the Bill allows a proper balance between centralised and decentralised decision-making.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said a lot about not making a judgment on this or that, claiming that it should be left to the judgment of others. But in making provisions to allow a failing grant-maintained school to introduce selection of up to 20 per cent. of its pupils, has the Minister considered that it may be a complete red herring, because it is highly unlikely that parents would want to send their children to a school that has been designated as failing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will not surprise the hon. Gentleman to know that that thought has crossed my mind.<br><br>
Again, this shows the difference between Opposition and Conservative Members. I am willing to allow that judgment to be made by the parents and the school. The hon. Gentleman's instinct, as the instinct of Opposition Members always is, is to decide what he thinks would be right and then to legislate for it. We are prepared to be open about the matter, to allow a possibility and not to close off that avenue were it to be one that the school considered desirable.<br><br>
Having identified a school's failing under the mechanisms that we introduced—and which Opposition Members opposed—we want to allow the school and, where appropriate, the local education authority, to respond to the challenge of having been

identified as failing in the way they consider appropriate. Recent history suggests that there is a welcome degree of success in such a process, because we want to leave it to the school and, where appropriate, the local education authority, or the grant-maintained school and its governors, to decide what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister cite any examples of when the problem was tackled by a local education authority introducing an element of selection in its schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot. That should not come as a surprise to Opposition Members, given that the bulk of local education authorities are probably ideologically and dogmatically opposed to selection. However, what may happen when the Bill comes into force and when we give schools the freedom to make such a judgment is that some may decide that an element of selection would help them to recover their standards and to serve their pupils—all their pupils—so much the better. For those reasons, I believe that the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Bath are somewhat mischevious; they are certainly misconceived and I ask the Committee to oppose them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall have a very interesting debate when we reach clause 7. No doubt there will be interesting debates on all the clauses, all of which will be in order. Nevertheless it will be particularly interesting to reach clause 7, because I shall be pressing the Minister to explain the difference between 20 per cent. and more in relation to failing grant-maintained schools. By then, I am sure that he will have been fully briefed and we look forward to his explanation.<br><br>
I wish to put on record my considerable thanks to the Minister for giving me, in such a polite way, his forgiveness for introducing the amendments. He was right when he said that both I and my party are opposed to grant-maintained status. There is no doubt about where we stand; our position is absolutely clear. Without being too critical of Labour Members, the Minister was right to point to a degree of confusion about the Labour party's views on grant-maintained status, but no doubt there will be an opportunity to discuss that outside the Room.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept my assurance that there is absolutely no confusion about the Labour party's approach to grant-maintained status? We shall remove grant-maintained status and we will subsume it in our new structure of schools of community—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 246</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was basing my belief that there is confusion not on my view—because I have carefully read the Labour party's documents—but rather more on the comments of many Labour party activists throughout the country and, indeed, on those of many Labour party spokespersons serving on local education authorities. They are suggesting that there is considerable confusion over the matter.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way to the hon. Gentleman, because I am sure that such a debate will take us well beyond the bounds of your patience, Sir Michael.<br><br>
I thank the Minister for forgiving me; I am disappointed that he thinks that the amendments are challenging the underpinning principle of the Bill. I thought that they would have been helpful and that he would accept them. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
