<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Kilfoyle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Walton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. I do not like raising points of order, although I had to do so last week after the Government ignominiously lost clause 3. Mr. O'Hara, the Chairman at that sitting, was forced to follow the rules and conventions of this place and, despite the illogicality of the Committee's position, we were forced to continue to debate clauses that were consequent upon the lost clause. Nevertheless, I feel impelled to seek your advice, Sir Michael, this morning. Given that the Government have now lost their overall majority in the House, I should like you to explain where the Committee stands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The position is that the Committee remains as it was constituted by the Committee of Selection.</span></p>

Clause 15</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
GRANTS TO PROMOTERS OF GRANT-MAINTAINED SCHOOLS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 154, in page 14, line 9, after "school" insert
<br><blockquote><p>"for which the authority is satisfied that there is demonstrable public support".</p></blockquote>
The clause will assist people who wish to promote a grant-maintained school. It is an open clause—in fact, it is one of the most generous measures that we might ever see from the Government. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The funding authority may, in the case of any persons proposing to establish a grant-maintained school, make grants to those persons in respect of expenditure incurred or to be incurred by them in connection with"</p></blockquote>
and then goes on to refer to the formulation of proposals and the preparation of particulars of proposed premises.<br><br>
The clause deals with a grant, without any conditions attached to it, which can be made to anyone who wants to set up a grant-maintained school. It says that the funding authority can require the grant to be repaid at some point in whole or in part, if it wishes to, but it places no conditions on the person receiving the grant. Theoretically, any person who just fancies setting up a grant-maintained school can apply for a grant. As there are no conditions attached to the grant, is there any reason why the funding authority should not make it? It is one of the few really open invitations
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 332</span>
from the Government, via the funding authority, to anyone who wants to establish a grant-maintained school.<br><br>
The amendment would insert into the clause the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"for which the authority is satisfied that there is demonstrable public support".</p></blockquote>
In order for a grant-maintained school to be promoted and for the Government to pay money, via the funding authority, surely there must be some idea that people want such a school in an area. The amendment is simple. It would introduce consultation—an element of democracy—into the Bill. At present, the measure will allow a super-quango to give away taxpayers' money, at the expense of LEAs, to promote the establishment of grant-maintained schools without there being any evidence of public support for such a school and without the authority having even sought such evidence.<br><br>
The amendment is fair. I should have thought that the Government would have been well disposed towards it and would agree to attaching conditions to an award of money. The Government tell us that their raison d'être is to give people freedom of choice rather than to impose from the centre. Under those circumstances, they cannot object to an amendment that seeks to allow those in the community whom the new school is to be created to serve to be consulted before a decision is taken.<br><br>
It is interesting to note that in clause 6(2), the Government have allowed grant-maintained schools wishing to expand or to change their provisions to carry out
<br><blockquote><p>"such consultation … as appears to them to be appropriate."</p></blockquote>
In something as fundamental as establishing a new grant-maintained school, it is logical that the Funding Agency for Schools should at least do what has to be done when a school wishes to expand.<br><br>
I suspect that Ministers have not read clause 15 in detail. Perhaps it was written by officials and the Minister did not have the opportunity to think about it before it appeared in print, otherwise he would have seen its illogicality. I realise that Treasury officials dominate the thinking of all Departments; the Treasury certainly tells them what funding is available. Indirectly, it will tell the Funding Agency for Schools what funding it can have. I believe that the clause was not seen by Treasury officials and that departmental officials must have written it without recourse to the Minister.<br><br>
The requirement now is that at least 10 per cent. of pupils must already attend grant-maintained schools in the area before the funding agency can establish a new one. Even that minimal proof of local support will now be jettisoned, along with the evidence that the vast majority of parents want schools to be accountable and open to the communities that they serve. It is patently obvious that the clause has nothing to do with extending parental choice. Indeed, it is the opposite; it seems to allow an ideologically driven quango to ride roughshod over the wishes of parents in the wider community.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 333</span>
New grant-maintained schools are likely to be proposed in areas where there are none. A new grant-maintained school might be justified if a large number of children in an area had to travel a considerable distance to a grant-maintained school outside the LEA boundary. Such a situation exists in my constituency. Morley has three comprehensive schools, but just over the boundary is Heckmondwike grammar school, one of the West Riding schools that I used to visit in the old days when I worked for the university.<br><br>
The number of pupils who go from Kirklees to the comprehensive schools in Morley is very much greater than the number of children who choose to go to Heckmondwike grammar school, the nearest grant-maintained school. Even though we are near the boundary of a city with only one grant-maintained secondary school, not many people want to cross the border and there is no demonstrable public support for a change of status. Indeed, the funding agency might consider a new grant-maintained school in Leeds simply because it had no grant-maintained school. However, it would do so only if there was a public out there waiting for such a school—parents who hoped that some Leeds schools might have changed their status and who were still looking for a similar school for their children—but there is no evidence of that.<br><br>
By accepting the amendment, the Government would be able to save quite a lot of money. Nothing could be worse than paying money out through the funding agency for someone to promote a school that was unwanted. We all want surplus places to be kept to a minimum.<br><br>
Last Tuesday, the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said that the expansion of grant-maintained schools would cause
<br><blockquote><p>"a reduction in the number of places in less popular schools",</p></blockquote>
which, although not sufficient for the schools to close, would
<br><blockquote><p>"considerably increase the financial burden"</p></blockquote>
on them and
<br><blockquote><p>"add to the total cost of the education system".</p></blockquote>
The Minister replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"There may be an element of truth in it in some circumstances".—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 3 December 1996; c. 209.]</p></blockquote>
Despite the grudging nature of the Minister's concession, if that is true for expansion, it must be true for building an entire, additional grant-maintained school.<br><br>
The amendment would mean that the provision of schools in an area would not be centrally imposed, which creates a market that is the worst of all worlds with no scope for the customer—the parent—to exercise choice or to shape the system. Under the clause, choice will be the prerogative of the few—of the funding agency and anyone who pops up to promote a school in the area. A Government quango is rarely a good vehicle for public will.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 334</span>
I hope that the Minister will recognise that there are already ways in which to establish whether there is public support in an area—by examining what has happened, for example. Even when less than 10 per cent. of people are prepared to send their children any distance to a grant-maintained school, one can discern a notable trend in the market. To set up a school without qualification, however, is a big mistake. The Government should find some way of establishing the degree of desire for a school among parents in the area. They should not allow the funding agency to put up good taxpayers' money—albeit recouped from the local authority—to promote a school unless they can determine from other evidence that there is a real need for it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I shock the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell)—and those members of the Committee who are listening—by saying that I agree very much with the thrust of what he said. He made a sensible and constructive suggestion, with which I do not disagree.<br><br>
I pick up in particular the last words from the hon. Gentleman's argument, which show us a way forward. He said that the Government should find some way of establishing a degree of demand from parents in the area before a grant-maintained school is established. I could not agree more. The only disagreement between us, which I hope is not significant, is that I have some difficulty with the form of words in the amendment—"demonstrable public support". That is a difficult concept not only to describe but to institutionalise and for which to provide a mechanism.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman would join me in thinking more in terms of a school's viability or evidence of viability, that would provide a way forward, and would be very much in line with the last part of his argument. I agree that it is right and appropriate that, if the funding agency is to give public money to a school venture, it must at the very least require evidence that the school is likely to be required and that parents will want to send their children to it.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman is prepared to allow me to consider what he has said, I shall try to find a way forward—perhaps, as he suggests, by replicating the existing procedure for the expansion of schools, or by introducing another form of words such as my suggestion on the evidence of viability and the need for the school. If the hon. Gentleman is prepared to withdraw the amendment on that basis, I shall undertake to introduce an amendment on Report to achieve the end that we share.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply; it is the most constructive response that we have heard to any amendment. I hope that the Government will consider other, equally sensible amendments in the same way. I am glad that the Minister accepts the idea of putting some qualifications on the funding of any body. I hope that his proposal will provide guidance for the Funding Agency for Schools so that it cannot set up a grant-maintained school willy nilly in an area
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0284">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 335</span>
where there is no evidence of support for it. I shall wait to see the Minister's proposal and, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Staffordshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 155, in page 14, line 10, after "expenditure" insert "on professional development fees".<br><br>
I hope that the Minister of State will be as generous with this amendment as he was with the previous one. We are starting to make some ground. The amendment is neither probing nor wrecking; in moving it, we are trying to help the Government to consider funding and public expenditure. We want the purpose of each grant to be defined more specifically. We seek to safeguard the effective and efficient use of public funds.<br><br>
The proposal on funding a new school conflicts with the Government's original remit for the FAS. More significantly, it introduces the risk of wasting public money on formulating proposals that are already the responsibility of LEAs without defining more clearly the purposes for which grants can be used.<br><br>
Subsection (2) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Grants may be made under this section on such terms and conditions as the funding authority think fit."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, there is a risk of enabling the FAS to make grants to the promoters of schools for public relations activities, which might include lobbying in support of their proposals. Instead, public expenditure should be constrained to those professional development fees that are legitimate costs incurred in the preparation of proposals. That would mirror the services for which LEAs are entitled to pay to develop proposals at present—for example, fees for architects, quantity surveyors, engineers, building control inspectors or preliminary planning applicants. Therefore, the amendment would clarify the purpose of such grants and constrain the funding agency's expenditure to fees for services that are legitimate contributions to the formulation of proposals.<br><br>
The Opposition have doubts about any proposed legislation under which public funds are handed to a quango with the instructions, "Spend them how you think fit." The House would have some doubts about that too. Constraints and safeguards must be placed on those who spend public money. The record of quangos shows that they have not been the best guardians of the public purse. Safeguards must be in place before the legislation is up and running.<br><br>
I know that the Minister will view this as a supportive amendment, meant to clarify the legislation. I do not want to give elaborate descriptions of those who can now come along and print many thousands of glossy brochures, put out the same papers at public meetings and lobby to generate a market that may or may not already be there. The total expense would far exceed anything that a local authority education department could contemplate. We are not only looking for a level playing field, but we want to safeguard public funds.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 336</span>
I shall not go on too long as the Minister recognises the gist of my argument. I am sure that he will follow precedent by recognising and accepting a sensible amendment to the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Prospective promoters can incur a number of costs in developing their proposals to establish new grant-maintained schools. For example, they might typically incur architects' and surveyors' fees in submitting details of existing premises to the funding authority for approval, or for developing capital projects for new accommodation. They might also incur fees on legal advice as to land tenure and trust arrangements, or expenditure on specialist financial or curriculum advice. There may be other smaller development costs which certain promoers may have difficulties in finding.<br><br>
Professional fees, particulary in relation to the preparation of premises details or plans for new premises will plainly be among the items of promoters' potential expenditure which might be considered for grant support. But I believe that it would be a mistake to close the door on other options by restricting grant to "professional development fees" in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that as the clause currently stands, the FAS can allow money to be spent on propaganda, by encouraging debate on whether or not there should be a certain type of school in a given area?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that would come under the auspices of the clause, but I want to take advice on that. I understand Opposition Members' suspicion of the funding agency, which I should have thought would have diminished in its three or four years of existence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) indicates not. He is a generous man normally and—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is perceptive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is perceptive as well, as he rightly points out. But I should have thought that the natural suspicions that Opposition Members had three years ago when we were debating the Bill to set up the funding agency might have diminished somewhat when they saw evidence of the harmonious and co-operative arrangements existing between the funding agency and local education authorities. In the same way that local education authorities are subject to examination by public bodies on the nature of their expenditure, the funding agency is, if anything, even more closely scrutinised on how it uses the public money at its disposal. It is extremely unlikely, to put it at its very least, that given the composition of the board of the funding agency and its statutory duties and limitations, it could go around spending money willy nilly in the way suggested by the hon. Member for South-East Staffordshire (Mr. Jenkins).<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0285">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 337</span>
I am arguing about something rather different. Restricting the possibilities under clause 15 simply to professional fees would eliminate or prevent legitimate expenditure on matters that might not be regarded in the rather strict definition of professional fees, but which would be quite legitimate in pursuing the possibility of setting up a grant-maintained school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the points made by my two hon. Friends, the Minister seems to be in some agreement that as the clause stands, it may be possible for the money to be used in a way that no one in the Committee would approve. Does the Minister agree that it is important to make the legislation clear as it is not right to predict the future behaviour of the FAS on the basis of what happens now? He should perhaps take some time to seek advice so that he can assure the Committee that the words, as they stand in the Bill, would not permit expenditure on propaganda. There is an element of agreement between us. The difference seems to be that the Minister thinks that it is not likely that such expenditure will occur, but that we want to ensure that it is not legally possible for it to happen. Will the Minister advise the Committee on the meaning of the wording in the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not think that that is right. Quite apart from the specific difficulty here of defining propaganda, as opposed to information, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris), with her considerable experience, knows the great difficulty in many spheres in distinguishing between propaganda and information. To include in a Bill the words, "Thou shalt not distribute propaganda at taxpayers' expense", would not take us much further forward.<br><br>
I believe that it is legitimate—indeed, necessary—within the terms and aims of the clause to allow the funding agency reasonable scope to provide reasonable funds for the purpose. To try to restrict that artificially, even in the sort of ingenious ways that the hon. Lady thought she had stumbled on, would not work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Marshall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister talked about the difficulty of defining propaganda and informative advertising. Would not it be perfectly informative to point out that grant-maintained schools have lower truancy rates and higher GCSE and A-level results, and that many have become oversubscribed, having once been undersubscribed schools? That is not propaganda; it is pure, informative advertising.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for providing that utterly unbiased information to the Committee and I am sure that Opposition Members are equally grateful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the hon. Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall) is here is remarkable enough. It is not remarkable that he should attempt to bail the Minister out.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 338</span>
The Minister made a telling comment about the composition of the FAS. I assume that he is referring to people such as Sir Robert Balchin and Stanley Kalms who are paragons of objectivity in their political approach. Let us suppose that there is a change in the composition of that quango—the FAS—because of a change of Government, perhaps, and that the duties of the FAS are redesignated to considering the role of grammar schools in the system. How would the Minister feel if the FAS had powers under the Bill to spend money on propaganda to encourage the closure of grammar schools in various areas, not least in Bromley, whose representative in Parliament the Minister, presumably, is shortly to be?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's unsolicited endorsement of my candidature in Chislehurst, Bromley. I may well distribute his words of wisdom throughout the constituency at the appropriate time. I am also grateful to the hon. Gentleman for confirming—as I think he has—that he envisages the continuation of the Funding Agency for Schools as a vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I confirm, as I have already said in the Committee and elsewhere, that the executive arm of the FAS is an extremely efficient group which has built up a body of expertise. Whether it should continue in the direction in which it is currently going is a matter for debate, but with the return of a Labour Government, we shall not waste that body of experience in York.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Committee sitting is proving to be most fruitful. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman has carried all his colleagues with him—we shall leave them to sort that out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not me.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In fairness, as ever, to the hon. Member for Bath, he and his party have been quite open about their outright hostility to grant-maintained schools and the Funding Agency for Schools. He has been absolutely consistent about the desire of the Liberal Democrats to see all grant-maintained schools disappear as soon as possible. I have not a sneaking but an open admiration for the hon. Member for Bath for taking that position.<br><br>
It is not quite the same with the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) because he has said that he envisages keeping the executive functions of the Funding Agency for Schools, by which he presumably means those provided for under the 1996 Act and perhaps the Bill. Those functions will include the legitimate activities that are set out in clause 15. However, given the agency's planning duties and its responsibility to co-operate with local education authorities, it must surely be able to pursue the possibility of setting up a new school in an area where there is evidence of viability and support for it.<br><br>
The present point is, however, a narrower one. If we accept an amendment that would restrict the expenditure of moneys to professional fees, we might
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0286">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 339</span>
prejudice the quality of work that is done when considering setting up a new school. I mentioned specialist financial and even curriculum advice, but I doubt whether those would arise from the payment of professional fees. The amendment could, therefore, unreasonably and improperly restrict the funding agency's activities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Minister is not deliberately misleading us, but he misses the essential point. We do not have doubts about the funding agency, but about the Bill's wording. Clause 15 clearly says that the funding authority may make grants on whatever terms and conditions it thinks fit. A promoter could, therefore, make a proposal and tell the council that it has a duty to make a payment under the Act. We therefore want to tighten up such grey areas. Relevant professional fees could be incorporated. We want to establish control in law over the amounts that are paid and determine who controls them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggested that if any old promoter drifted into view and said, "Hey, guy, I've got a good idea. Give us some money to pursue it," the funding agency would have a duty to give him large wodges of taxpayer's money and say, "Good on you, sport. Off you go with all this money." Events would not, however, go quite like that. The funding agency has duties and responsibilities to the taxpayer, which are set out in statute. The idea that it could hand over unspecified sums to anyone who claimed to have a good idea for a new school is far short of the target.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us take a situation in which the population expands and a new school is needed. There might be a funding agency proposal to establish a grant-maintained school and an LEA proposal to establish an LEA-maintained school. Is it fair that the Funding Agency for Schools could spend money on promoting its concept while the LEA, whose actions would be constrained by legislation on provision of information, could not spend the same amount? Is that a level playing field? Would not it make sense to create a level playing field through the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have never noticed that LEAs are constrained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are by law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) says that they are by law, but I was referring simply to my observations and recent experience. I could invite—or incite—some of my hon. Friends to give impassioned accounts of what their local education authorities have done and spent in their localities to prevent grant-maintained schools from developing. I did not want to do that, but my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, South has caught my eye.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 340</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister may remember the Greater London council campaign in which the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) spent £10 million of ratepayers' money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was the danger. I did not want to open the floodgates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Members of the Committee are no doubt greatly enjoying these exchanges, but I draw their attention to the terms of the amendment and suggest that we keep to them now we have had a little fun.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will keep to order, but the point is that the Government themselves passed legislation after the abolition of the GLC to constrain any local authority's ability to publish information to promote a particular idea. After that—I think it was in 1988–89, but I might have my years wrong—there would not be a level playing field if the Funding Agency for Schools could spend money on propaganda while an LEA could not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I really want to conclude because we are getting bogged down. If the hon. Member for South-East Staffordshire looks at clause 15(2), he will see that it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Grants may be made under this section on such terms and conditions as the funding authority think fit."</p></blockquote>
There is no duty—they "may" be made. The funding agency will consider, in its professional and expert way, proposals and promoters' claims for expenses and reimbursements, and it will make a reasonable and normal decision on that basis. The clause is reasonable and the funding agency's duties and responsibilities are already well set out. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister went halfway to recognising that there would be certain legitimate costs and fees with regard to establishing a grant-maintained school and that they would be funded by the council. But the words of the Bill and those in the documents that have been issued allow the funding authority to pay such grants on whatever terms and conditions it thinks fit. There is a large gulf between the words in the Bill and what the Minister said. If he would say, "The words 'on professional development fees' are too constrictive, but let me take the amendment back and see if I can find words on which we can agree and which wouldn't give an open cheque to the grant-maintained school promoters", we would be a lot happier. Legislation should be drawn up not on the terms and conditions that the funding authority thinks fit, but on the terms and conditions that we think fit. We want more information, more control and more assessment of the costs to the public purse.<br><br>
The Minister refuses to accept any move other than giving that blank cheque to the grant-maintained school promoters and the Funding Authority for Schools. On those grounds, I have no option other than to press my amendment to a vote.</span></p>

RECOVERY FROM LOCAL FUNDS OF SUMS IN RESPECT OF START-UP GRANTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 156, in page 14, line 38, leave out "determine" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"consider, after consultation with the local education authority, corresponds to the amount which the local education authority itself would have expended during that period in respect of the initial costs of the school if it had been a county school".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may consider amendment No. 66, in page 14, line 42, leave out from "year" to "shall" in line 1 on page 15.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The simple purpose of amendment No. 156 is to limit the amount of money recouped from the local education authority to the level that it would spend on the start-up costs of a county school. It is important at this stage to establish that there will be no repeat of the manifestly unfair situation that obtained with grant-maintained schools or of the ensuing arguments. I am sure that the Government do not want a rerun of those arguments.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to limit the powers of the Funding Agency for schools to recover from the local education authority the costs of establishing a new grant-maintained school by limiting the amount recouped to the level that the local education authority would spend on any county school. The amendment's underlying principle is to ensure consistent treatment. Nobody would object to consistency in the treatment meted out to local education authority schools and grant-maintained schools.<br><br>
The funding arrangements for new grant-maintained schools should be consistent with those that would apply in the case of a new school maintained by the local education authority, which would, in any other circumstances, be determined in accordance with the given authority's local management of schools formula. Local education authority's local management of schools schemes set out the detailed funding arrangements applicable to local education authority-maintained schools. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 342</span>
amendment aims simply to ensure that any recoupment from the relevant local education authority for the establishment of a new school is done in agreement with the local funding formula governing local education authority schools. Opposition Members would emphasise that that would be entirely in accordance with the Government's publicly stated objectives to underpin the funding arrangements for grant-maintained schools in relation to both the common funding formula and the annual maintenance grants. Those arrangements should refer to grant-maintained schools and local education authority schools.<br><br>
The annual maintenance grant arrangements are based on the principle of replication of the area's local management of schools scheme. If it is accepted that the overall revenue funding of the new grant-maintained schools should honour that principle, it should equally follow that any recoupment from the relevant local education authority for the establishment of a new grant-maintained school should also adhere to that principle.<br><br>
The Bill would give the Secretary of State unfettered discretion in determining the amounts that might be recovered from the local education authority for the start-up costs of a grant-maintained school. If the Government were to accept the amendment, it would provide for equitable treatment of grant-maintained and local education authority schools in the exercise of the Secretary of State's powers to recoup the funds from the local education authority.<br><br>
In the current public expenditure climate, where the need to ensure value for money as well as effectiveness is accepted on both sides of the House to be an overriding priority, it is essential that the Government act, and are seen to act, fairly and consistently in all aspects of school funding policy. Parents, governors, pupils and the electorate all need to be assured that Government policy on school funding operates to ensure consistent and equitable treatment between schools, whether primary or secondary, grant-maintained, or local education authority-maintained. It would be unacceptable if local education authority schools were penalised by any measures that sought to claw back more funding than was strictly necessary or fair, to the benefit of a new grant-maintained school and at the direct expense of the majority of pupils attending local education authority schools in an area.<br><br>
I stress that the amendment should not be seen as an attempt to place unnecessary or unreasonable restrictions on the power of the Secretary of State. It provides simply for appropriate reference to be made to the relevant local education authority's published formula for funding arrangements for its schools, and for any necessary consultation with the local education authority.<br><br>
The LEA local management of schools scheme is agreed with the Secretary of State following consultation with schools in the given local education authority area. It is therefore transparent and commands the support of all maintained schools in that local education authority area. It is only fair and reasonable that the Funding Agency for Schools and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0288">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 343</span>
the Secretary of State be equally required to abide by a similarly straightforward regime to govern the funding that could be recovered from the LEA to fund the establishment of any new grant-maintained school.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mrs. Cheryl Gillan)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that what I shall say will give the hon. Member for Walton some comfort. Clause 16 gives the Secretary of State powers to recoup the start-up grant paid to a new grant-maintained school before it opens. As in all matters of recoupment, the Secretary of State must use her powers to recoup start-up grants reasonably. She would consider each case on its merits, taking account of LEA representations, before making decisions.<br><br>
It is certainly our intention that, in making recoupment decisions, the Secretary of State should consider carefully the comparison with new LEA county schools and LEAs' own practice in relation to the support they provide to those schools before they open. I do not believe, however, that they should be specified in the Bill.<br><br>
The amendment poses a number of problems. First, how can one tell what an LEA would have spent? That is about hypothesis, not fact. Secondly, there could be the difficulty that the LEA may have no recent practice of establishing a new school—it may not have established a new school for 10, 15 or 20 years—which might otherwise form the basis for an actual comparison of costs. Thirdly, the Secretary of State may need to come to a judgment on indirect LEA expenditure in the form of overheads and whether some or all of that expenditure might be recouped in individual cases.<br><br>
I believe that it is right that the amount of the recoupment that might apply be determined in consultation with LEAs—and I stress that. Where necessary, we already engage LEAs in consultation on recoupment questions that arise under existing provisions in the Education Act 1996. We do not propose to depart from that practice in relation to the clause 16 recoupment.<br><br>
The amendment refers to a comparison with county schools. We envisage that schools to which the Secretary of State's powers under clause 16 will apply will mainly be those established to meet population growth in the area—basic need. In other words, such schools would meet growth, which the LEA would otherwise have met if the new school had been in the LEA sector.<br><br>
Brand new schools might also be established by independent promoters to meet demand from particular faiths or denominations. They may or may not meet basic need. The comparison would be not with county schools but with voluntary-aided schools in the LEA maintained sector. I would not wish to fetter the Secretary of State's discretion to consider, in consultation with the LEA, the case for recoupment of start-up grant in such cases.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 344</span>
It will be plain from what I have said that it is indeed our intention to consult LEAs about recoupment in each case where a governing body has received a startup grant under clause 16. It makes good, practical sense for my Department to take active steps to solicit views and enable issues to come forward for debate at the earliest possible moment.<br><br>
I listened carefully to the arguments of the hon. Member for Walton on establishing the corresponding initial costs of an LEA county school. I repeat that the Secretary of State will base her decision on recoupment under clause 16 on a careful comparison with LEA support for its own schools, in consultation with the LEA in question. I believe that it is neither practical nor desirable to seek to achieve that intention in the Bill. The Secretary of State will consider each case on its merits, taking account of LEA representations, which will be invited by means of active consultation. In that way, she will ensure that she can come to reasonable decisions on recoupment under clause 16.<br><br>
If the hon. Member for Walton recognises the strength of those arguments, I am sure that he will withdraw the amendment; if not, I shall have no option but to urge the Committee to reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to what the Under-Secretary read, as opposed to what she thinks, on the matter. I make two points, which I believe to be salient to our discussion.<br><br>
First, the Under-Secretary paints a picture that the clause is about creating schools to cater for basic need. We are told that it is about choice and diversity—a Government euphemism for creating more grammer schools, whether or not there is a basic need for them and whether or not there are surplus places. That has been part of our debate hitherto and, I am sure, will continue to be so in future.<br><br>
My second point is that the Government cannot link the rate of recoupment to the existing local management of schools formula. After all, we are talking about the start-up costs of establishing the new schools, not the capital costs. The Under-Secretary of State has been handed a brief, which is as dead as a banger from bonfire night gone. The Opposition cannot withdraw the amendment, because we foresee the dangers whereby local education authorities will again be penalised to advantage the ideological stance of the Government in seeking to establish grant-maintained schools in areas where there has been manifestly no public support for them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Under-Secretary was talking about the costs incurred by a local education authority in starting up a new school due to population expansion and said that no additional cost will be placed on the LEA if it does not provide the school? What about a grant-maintained school that is established in an existing area where there is no proposed expansion in population?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seemed to confuse some of the issues because, in the same breath as she was talking about the need for expansion, she was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0289">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 345</span>
dismissive of the role of LEAs in catering for that need. She referred to the different authority areas where there had been no new school for 10 or 20 years. It would be more accurate if she had said 10 to 18 years, especially in view of the Conservative party's tenure in office since 1979.<br><br>
None the less, in view of the wholly inadequate response from the Under-Secretary and in order to facilitate future peace and harmony in those many local education areas that have already been abused in the name of the grant-maintained schools movement, we must vote in favour of the amendment despite the pleas of the hon. Lady to do otherwise.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 131, in page 15, line 3, after "(8C)", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (8D) below".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 132, in page 15, line 13, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(8D) The Secretary of State shall consider any representations made to him by a local education authority that it would be unreasonable for him to recover sums due to him under subsection (8C) and he shall not be entitled to recover them without specifying his reasons for not acceding to such representations.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, this is a reasonable group of amendments. It is concerned with the recovery of local authority funds to cover the costs of start-up grants for grant-maintained schools.<br><br>
Throughout our debates and in our debates in other Committees, the Government have always explained their support for grant-maintained schools as if such schools existed in isolation from the local authority's responsibility for education and had no impact on the schools that remain with the LEA. The Government talk about choice for parents and pupils but seem to understand that the exercise of that choice by one individual has a knock-on effect on others—parents, pupils and other schools.<br><br>
This is a classic case. Under clause 16, individuals or organisations can make a case for a grant-maintained school and the funds will be provided by the funding authority. The Secretary of State will ensure that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 346</span>
cost eventually falls on the local authority and the community, who will have no say on the spending of money for which it is ultimately accountable.<br><br>
Every local education authority has its budget capped. Because the level of Government grant is already determined, extra money spent by the authority has to be funded through the council tax. Funding the start-up grant for new grant-maintained schools will have one of two consequences for local authorities: either they will have to raise the council tax if they are free to do so and are not capped; or, if they are capped or just below their cap, they will have to decide whether to fund that extra expenditure by reducing expenditure on other services.<br><br>
The consequences go far beyond the individuals immediately affected by the creation of a new school. There will be a wider impact. Such a change will potentially affect everyone in the community who pays council tax; the education service will be affected by reduced expenditure and less money will be spent on other services. It cuts across all the Government's arguments on grant-maintained schools that they do not accept that decisions of that sort have much wider knock-on consequences.<br><br>
We have raised the matter of the extension of grant-maintained schools, whether it concerns the capacity of the buildings—although that is somewhat in doubt, given the events of the other day—or the schools' ability to change to or extend selection or to create sixth forms. All those actions have potential consequences.<br><br>
Indeed, great concern was expressed in my constituency at the weekend over the Minister's suggestion for the priority repair of school buildings, which will affect the entire school budget of my local authority. The Under-Secretary sent in her inspectors, without reference to the LEA, to look at the problems of Silverdale school in the constituency of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Sir I. Patnick) and is apparently giving out the message to the governors of that school that they should vote to become grant-maintained. Funding will automatically be provided during this financial year by the funding authority to ensure that repairs to that school jump to the top of the priority list, over and above all other priorities in the city of Sheffield. The Government are using the incentive of extra funding, like a dangling carrot, to get governors to vote for grant-maintained status. Of course, in the end, it is not extra funding. That school will be funded at the expense of other local authority schools or services.<br><br>
So, a year after architects from the Department for Education and Employment accepted that the buildings at Birley Spar—a Derwent system school—needed to be replaced as they were literally falling down—there is still no new school. Although that school is at the top of the authority's list, it will not receive any more capital allocation this year. However, a school well down the list, which has a grant-maintained carrot dangled in front of it, will be promised that the Government will provide the necessary funding—it will jump to the top of the list. That will affect priorities in the funding of education.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0290">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 347</span>
11.30 am<br><br>
Under clauses 15 and 16, funding will come from local authority budgets that might be capped and, therefore, council tax will have to be increased. Given that that will have an undoubted knock-on consequence on the rest of the education service and potentially on other services within the local authority remit, local authorities must be given a statutory right—not simply a vague promise that Ministers using best practice will somehow ensure that local authorities will be consulted—which ensures that the Secretary of State will consider any local authorities' representation to her. Local authorities believe that it would be unreasonable to recover costs from them becuase the funds will have to come from capped budgets, which will have a consequence on other services. If those representations are proper and based on good argument, the Secretary of State should give her reasons for overriding them and not acceding to the views of local authorities.<br><br>
Given that we are talking about local authority resources and that those resources are either capped or can be increaed only if people pay more council tax, local authorities should have a statutory right to make representations and the Secretary of State should have a statutory duty to give her reasons for believing that those representations are not well founded. That would be a proper expression of the democratic process, and the Minister should recognise that fact and accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As with so many others, the amendment is otiose, and I am sure that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) will recognise that.<br><br>
It is a fundamental principle of administrative law that the Secretary of State has to act reasonably in exercising her powers and duties. Accordingly, in taking any decision on recoupment—whether in respect of start-up grant paid to new grant-maintained schools or more generally—the Secretary of State must take account of all the relevant facts and circumstances, including issues raised with her by local education authorities. It is not a matter of choice—she is obliged to consider their representations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Under-Secretary is saying, but I have heard similar words before. Will she tell us of the specific legal requirement under which the Secretary of State must act in that way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will take some advice on that and tell the hon. Gentleman of the requirement's exact provenance. I am sure that he would prefer me to be accurate and give him chapter and verse, rather than something off the top of my head.<br><br>
It follows that there are strong grounds under administrative law practice, besides being a matter of courtesy, for giving reasons where the Secretary of State takes a different view from an LEA on a recoupment matter. It is our general practice in disputed cases which arise under existing recoupment law to specify reasons for decisions that are unwelcome to LEAs. Plainly, we would not propose to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 348</span>
adopt any different practice in the case of disputes about the recoupment of start-up grants. Therefore, the amendments are unnecessary, both in general administrative law terms and in view of my Department's practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to help the Minister. It would help the Committee to know clearly where the law stands on this matter. Is she ready to explain where that legal requirement is to be found? She has only said, "This is good practice, so we will do it." We want a guarantee that there is a legal requirement, on not only the current Secretary of State but future Secretaries of State, to ensure that local authorities will have such a right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that that is a matter of general administrative law; if the Secretary of State does not take into account points made by the local authority, she can be successfully challenged. There is no specific legal requirement, but it is general administrative practice.<br><br>
I must comment on some of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Attercliffe about the situation in Sheffield. I hope that he was not implying that officials from the Department for Education and Employment should not visit schools in his area—particularly Silverdale school, which he mentioned. In considering the problems of school buildings in his area, he should reflect on the fact that the Sheffield education authority could not do its sums last year and made errors that cost millions of pounds, thereby losing the confidence of the local education system. I suggest that the Committee reject the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was an interesting response. The Minister's case—her brief seems to have been changed halfway through—was based on the presumption that there was a requirement on the Secretary of State to consult in many circumstances, some of which could be found in a little corner of a previous Act. It was presumed that when the Secretary of State was considering proposals that would have an impact on the LEA, she had a duty to consult the authority and take into account its representations. When challenged on that, the Minister came up with a few measly words—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Weaselly?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Weaselly, if the Minister prefers. The hon. Lady came up with the argument that there was a general duty under administrative law. We could have come to that conclusion without a 10-minute wait for officials to come to the rescue. The requirement is merely to send out a letter to find out what people think; there is no formal duty to consult, listen to the LEA's response and then to give reasons.<br><br>
If Ministers are seen to behave in a high-handed fashion—they may have taken into account matters that should not be taken into account, or vice versa—they are always open to challenge in administrative law through judicial review; indeed, it seems that some Ministers are never out of the courts, having been challenged on the way in which they exercise their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0291">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 349</span>
powers. That general requirement does not mean, however, that the Government never include in Bills specific requirements on themselves or other public bodies for consultation. There are such requirements in many Bills enacted under the Government—we have often referred to the requirements to consult parents, schools and LEAs. Despite the general requirement under administrative law to behave properly and reasonably and to consult, the Government believe, therefore, that, in certain cases, it is appropriate to mention consultation in Bills.<br><br>
We believe that one such case is where LEA or local council money is being spent as a result of a decision made by the Secretary of State or a Government quango. Before any money is spent, it is reasonable and proper that the local authority be consulted and its views taken into account; if the Secretary of State does not agree with those views, she should be asked to explain why.<br><br>
The Minister mentioned Department for Education and Employment officials. Of course it is right that Government architects and inspectors should occasionally visit schools; it is wrong, however, when they do not consult the local authority that has responsibility for a school and go into it over the authority's head. The Minister did not deny the allegation that she goes around promising extra money through the funding authority if a school votes for grant-maintained status. That is improper influence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should withdraw those remarks; I have never been to a school and said that it can get extra money if it becomes grant maintained. Schools have a free choice of whether to consider grant-maintained status and a parental ballot must ensue. If the hon. Gentleman does not withdraw those remarks immediately, I shall be extremely disappointed and ask him to justify them outside the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether that it is an invitation to tea or to dinner.<br><br>
If the Minister is giving an assurance that she has made no commitment to Silverdale that it will receive extra funding if it goes grant maintained, I am happy to withdraw my remarks. I am sure that the message will be relayed to the school's governors that the decision they are taking is different from that which some of them imagine—with its promise of money to come.<br><br>
I shall press the amendment to a Division. A requirement for local authority consultation is appropriate and reasonable.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was going to assure the Under-Secretary of State, who has left the room, that this is not an otiose amendment—I am learning lots of new words in this Committee—but a reasonable amendment. It reflects something about the Government's style, which is important. Throughout the Bill, the Minister has argued that he wishes to retain flexibility, but that could bring the Executive into disrepute if it is used for political, rather than Executive action. If the Minister were to accept our amendments, he would avoid allegations that the Executive was biased in how it conducted ballots.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0292">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 351</span>
11.45 am<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 157 and 158 would ensure that there is a ballot observer for every ballot held for a school seeking grant-maintained status. The amendments would remove the flexibility and the need for the Secretary of State to decide on a case-by-case basis whether a ballot observer was appropriate and would ensure a level playing field between the school and the LEA. The Minister of State has talked constantly about the Bill being permissive. Let us hope that it is permissive in the manner of a level playing field.<br><br>
The background is that Ministers have expressed concern in the past over the unfair influence that has been exerted on parents with regard to grant-maintained schools. I understand that there have been complaints on about 15 per cent. of ballots, although the Minister said earlier that only two had reached the Secretary of State. Whether ballots are fair or unfair is open to question, but the fact that only two complaints reached the Secretary of State is probably because it is too difficult to prove anything to Ministers.<br><br>
I am delighted that there is a draft circular on this issue. We have asked for them on other issues and I do not know why this one has been produced while others have not. It would have been helpful to have draft circulars on other parts of the Bill to which we have tabled amendments. The Minister says in the circular that the problem with the current framework is that the Secretary of State can intervene only after the event. That can take months to complete, so it is difficult to guard against problems during the ballot. If that is true, it would be sensible to have observers at all ballots.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is shaking his head, so I look forward to his logical, rather than political argument. Is the Minister referring to LEAs in the circular, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Misinformation may be circulated to parents by various parties."?</p></blockquote>
In previous debates, we have heard that the Funding Agency for Schools will have the capacity to do that. The circular continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"There may be irregularities in the way the ballot is conducted. Complaints of intimidation may arise."</p></blockquote>
I presume that neither of those remarks is an allegation against LEAs.<br><br>
During our proceedings on 21 November, the Minister conceded that sometimes the fault lies not with the LEA, but with others. When my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) reported on a head teacher who was in favour of grant-maintained status and rang parents lobbying for a yes vote, the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"That is exactly why there are proposals in the Bill to have observers".—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 21 November 1996; c. 56.]</p></blockquote>
The issue is that anybody could attempt to fiddle the ballot. It could be those who oppose the grant-maintained school or those who support it. Both sides could behave badly and it would therefore be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 352</span>
appropriate to have abservers to discourage either eventuality. Let us get rid of the possibility by ensuring that there are observers everywhere. Then there will be no foul play and a level playing field between participants, whatever side of the argument they take. We would also save trees, and bureaucrats in Whitehall would not have to produce such incredibly long documents—the length of the consultation paper on whether there should be observers and in what circumstances is extraordinary. The Minister is creating yet another huge bureaucracy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A few moments ago, the hon. Lady was complaining that we had not produced sufficient of those excellent briefings on other parts of the Bill. Now she complains because we have produced an excellent and comprehensive briefing on this part of the Bill. Will she make up her mind?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are not briefings—they are draft circulars. I should have welcomed draft circulars on issues that the Minister refused to include in the Bill, namely in relation to consultation on changes, whether changes in selection procedures or changes when a grant-maintained school wants to expand its numbers. However, we would not need a draft circular on the issue that we are debating if our amendment were accepted and there were a ballot observer in every situation. That would be a sensible, pragmatic and common-sense measure, but far be it from me to suggest that the Government should adopt a bit of common sense in any area of public policy.<br><br>
By leaving the Government some flexibility, we raise several questions. Who is entitled to request that there should be a ballot observer—should it be the school, the LEA, the parent petitioner or a governor? In what circumstances should the Secretary of State intervene? Page 3 of the circular suggests that the Secretary of State ought to intervene in one extremely worrying circumstance—when there has been a formal ballot investigation over the past year. With the greatest respect, that is a lot of nonsense. A group of litigious or bolshie parents might choose to challenge a ballot for no other reason than being litigious or bolshie. That would lead to an investigation, which would create an unlevel playing field because in future ballots, there would automatically have to be observers, whereas in other situations there would not.<br><br>
People will have to wander through a bureaucratic maze, but that would be utterly unnecessary if we created a level playing field by having an observer at every ballot. I do not know whether the Minister is expecting a huge number of ballots. Perhaps he is not because he does not expect many schools to want grant-maintained status. If that is the case, I agree with him. Nor do I expect the cost of holding the ballots to be excessive—certainly not, given the bad value for money way in which the Government are flinging money around elsewhere in the Bill, which we shall see when we come to the assisted places scheme. If the Government are in favour of fair ballots, they should accept this simple and pragmatic amendment. As usual, we shall probably win the argument and lose the vote.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0293">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 353</span>
Amendment No. 159 is also pragmatic and is especially important, because the question of where the ballot will take place is controversial and potentially divisive for a particular community. It is crucial that if a ballot is held, it should be seen to be fair. Amendment No. 159 suggests that the person appointed as the ballot observer should be an independent person with experience of either the conduct of ballots or the provision of education.<br><br>
Some of us may have participated as observers of ballots in countries where a democratic process is being established. There are many people with such experience who would be appropriate ballot observers. There are plenty of people in education who have experience in a slightly different but related field. I have participated—as, no doubt, has the Minister—in admission and exclusion appeals in local authority areas. That is a large group of people from whom the Minister could select to ensure that an independent person is appointed observer. Instead of clearly setting out the issue in the circular, the Minister, I fear, is unnecessarily prolonging what could be an easy issue to resolve.<br><br>
In admission and exclusion appeals, the law provides for the appointment of lay members. The qualities of a lay member of an appeal committee, as laid down in the law, are
<br><blockquote><p>"a person without personal experience in the management of any school or the provision of any education in any school otherwise than as a governor or in another voluntary capacity…and must not have, or must not at any time have had, any connection with the Authority in question or with any person who is a member of or employed by that Authority of a kind which might reasonably be taken to raise doubts about his/her ability to act impartially in relation to the Authority."</p></blockquote>
In the case of a lay member appointed by a governing body, the law similarly requires that
<br><blockquote><p>"that person must not have, or at any time have had, any connection with the school in question or with any person who is a member of, or employed by, the governing body of that school of a kind which might reasonably be taken to raise doubts about his/her ability to act impartially in relation to the school."</p></blockquote>
Those quotes show that there are perfectly sensible precedents which could be used in this case to build a system for ensuring that ballot observers are properly independent people.<br><br>
The amendment would require an independent person to have appropriate experience either in the conducts of ballots or in the provision of education. It is a simple, straightforward attempt to ensure that the independent person has the necessary experience and capacity fully to understand the issues and circumstances that might arise in the context of a ballot on grant-maintained status for a school. The amendment sets out no more than a reasonable expectation of the range of prior knowledge and expertise that a ballot observer would require to fulfil the duties envisaged in the Bill.<br><br>
The amendment does not seek to interfere with the functions of the ballot observer or attempt to prejudge the nature and content of any guidance that the Secretary of State might give. It simply attempts to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 354</span>
clarify the expectation that any ballot observer should be independent and impartial. The amendment is common sense and I hope that the Minister will accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I want to make two points, and I look forward to the Minister's response.<br><br>
I agree with the thrust of the comments of the hon. Member for Barking, but I cannot entirely agree with all her remarks, particularly in respect of the consultation process that is taking place. That consultation is helpful and the Department's document is particularly so. The hon. Lady is wrong to suggest that there would be no need for the consultation if the amendments were accepted. The circular covers many issues and the Committee and the Department will be interested in the responses to various issues.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
It would help the Committee if the Minister spoke in a little more detail than he did in the consultation circular about the public appointments unit. He suggested in paragraph 19(a) that a public appointments unit might be a source of candidates. Later in the section, however, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"In seeking ballot observers, the Department could give the PAU a set of requirements concerning necessary skills and experience etc."</p></blockquote>
The document does not, however, make it clear what skills and experience are required and may, indeed, cover some of the proposals in amendment No. 159.<br><br>
I was a little surprised by paragraph 20, and would welcome the Minister's comments on it. It stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Candidates would not be required to have prior knowledge of the education service, and of grant-maintained issues in particular."</p></blockquote>
Why should that not be one of the categories for which candidates should have some experience? Many of the disputes that have occurred during grant-maintained ballots are complicated and would require a detailed understanding of the way in which the education service works.<br><br>
I want to illustrate that point and make a separate point at the same time. I hope that the Minister by now agrees that complaints about the handling of ballots have come from both sides. Traditionally, the LEA has been criticised for giving out misleading information, and words such as "intimidation" have been used. There is, however, a growing body of evidence to suggest that legitimate criticisms have been made of the way in which the proponents of grant-maintained status have handled the ballot procedure.<br><br>
One case, which I have raised in the House and in another Committee, concerned a primary school in my constituency. The promoters stated that the school would lose three members of staff if it did not become grant-maintained—they even went so far as to name the staff involved. That was later shown to be erroneous information. In the more recent case of the Arthur Mellows village college in the Prime Minister's constituency, the information that the governors provided to parents contained considerable irregularities. The Secretary of State herself accepted
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0294">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 355</span>
that the information was misleading and it was a great pity that she was not prepared to declare the ballot void.<br><br>
There are examples of misinformation from both sides. The point is, however, that such misinformation concerned technical issues, such as school's budgetary requirements, staffing arrangements and curriculum delivery. To understand such complaints, a ballot observer should have some prior understanding of the education service.<br><br>
My second point concerns the sensible suggestion in the amendments on the hon. Member for Barking that there should be a ballot observer in all subsequent ballots and that we should not wait for his appointment to be triggered by a request from one of the numerous bodies that are proposed. My evidence for suggesting that the hon. Lady is right comes not from her own remarks—although I entirely agree with them—but from the Government's consultation circular. Paragraph 12 of that circular, which I have praised, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"As noted below, the decision will have to be made quickly."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 21 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The observer would need to be appointed at an early stage in the ballot, because the constraints of the statutory timescale for GM ballots would still apply, and there is little point in appointing an observer late in the process when the conduct of the ballot may already have gone awry."</p></blockquote>
The critical point is that under the Bill, people can seek to propose that there be a ballot observer only when something goes wrong and, in the Government's own words, by then it will be too late.<br><br>
Given that not many ballots are expected to occur in the next few years—only 0.5 per cent. of all eligible schools have considered holding a ballot in the past 12 months—it would not be an undue expense to have a ballot observer in every case and the concerns expressed in the Government circular would be met.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can deal briefly with those points, but I will not pre-empt the consultation. The hon. Member for Bath is perfectly entitled to ask questions based on the consultation document. No doubt he will make his views known, and we will take them into consideration in the consultation process. However, I shall not pre-empt the result by hazarding a guess at the response or by being drawn into a detailed discussion of the consultation process, as I would be criticised for being in danger of nullifying the process.<br><br>
On whether a ballot should be held in every case—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An observer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. On whether an observer should be appointed in every case, the truth is that most ballots are perfectly straightforward, peaceful events conducted by reasonable people. It would be extremely heavy handed, bureaucratic and unnecessarily expensive for observers to be appointed in every case. The point of the exercise is to provide an additional mechanism to reassure people that ballots are proper and above board. Therefore, to presume that everything that happens is bad, undesirable or wicked is a rather peculiar view of the world.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 356</span>
We take the view that sensible, reasonable people will generally conduct ballots sensibly and reasonably. However, there are regrettably exceptions to that, which undoubtedly occur on both sides of the argument, and the observer mechanism in the Bill is intended to deal with such occurrences. So I am not persuaded that observers should become part of the ballot procedure. That is based on a wrong reading of how the procedure will work.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bath for his welcoming comments on the document, which was a genuine attempt to set out our thinking and to request comments and input. We will consider what he and the hon. Member for Barking said as being at least part of their response to that request, but I hope that many others and those on the long list of consultees attached to the document will also want to respond.<br><br>
Depending on the nature of the responses, we shall consider, for example, whether or not every observer must have prior and detailed knowledge of either balloting or grant-maintained schools. For example, if the rules were drawn too tightly, as the Opposition suggest, either an eminent, retired member of the judiciary or a distinguished head teacher of an LEA school might be precluded from acting as an observer. The Committee would agree that that would be unwise and unnessarily limiting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification on one point. The document is out for consultation and I know that the Minister will assure the Committee that he will consider the comments that he receives. If many consultees tell him that they too would like observers to be present at every ballot, does the Minister believe that he will have the flexibility under the law to change his mind in response to that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I might also consider whether to change the process so that consultees pay for it. We are entering free lunch territory—the old, familiar trick of saying, "Here is something that you can all decide on; of course, someone else is paying for it." But there is never a someone else; it is always the taxpayer. The only question is through which channel the money is redirected and in which way the poor taxpayer is mugged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us get rid of grant-maintained ballots, then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady thinks that her suggestion that people should choose whether to ballot is a winning proposition, but someone other than the Secretary of State would have to pay for it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that another of the criteria that the Secretary of State will take into account when deciding whether observers will be appointed is the budget set aside for ballot observers? Are we discussing a cash-limited proposal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, of course not. Some provision would necessarily have to be made, in the normal way, in departmental accounting, but I cannot imagine any Secretary of State regarding that as a limiting factor. If, after the next general election, there were a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0295">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 357</span>
stunning—if, in some quarters, unexpected—Conservative victory, followed by an avalanche of grant-maintained school ballots, a higher proportion of which were more controversial that I would anticipate—because by then I should think that everyone would realise that the game was up and that grant-maintained balloting had become a normal process—and there were a huge demand for observers, the Department would respond in its usual way and would have to adjust its budgetary arrangements. I do not anticipate that being a problem for any reason.<br><br>
We believe that it is heavy-handed and unnecessary to make the appointment of observers an obligatory element of the ballot process; on the other hand whilst the questions raised by Opposition Members about eligibility of observer status are reasonable, I prefer to keep my options open—as I hope Opposition Members would expect—until we see the nature of the replies to the consultation process. We can then decide what to do, but with the open mind that the hon. Lady has invited me to keep. For those reasons, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will not surprise you, Sir Michael, if I say that the Minister has again completely missed the point. The Government, not the Opposition, propose the appointment of ballot observers because they believe that the fact that there are not as many grant-maintained schools, or as many parents proposing that schools go grant-maintained, as they would like, shows that ballots have been rigged. What is so wrong about the Government's approach is that instead of establishing a level playing field whereby observers are appointed in every instance, they are establishing an uneven playing field whereby they will decide when to appoint an observer, at a school's expense—or at the expense of someone other than the Government. So the Government will make decisions in a partial way and not at their expense—a free lunch for them—when they believe that the outcome of a ballot will suit their purpose. That is typical of the abuse of Executive power that we have seen over many years.<br><br>
It is nonsense for the Minister to suggest that it would be inappropriate to appoint someone who had been, for example, a judge or an LEA chief executive during his or her professional life. The amendment would stop the Government simply putting up local Conservative party worthies as ballot observers. We tabled the amendment because of our experience of the abuse of public appointments system involving quangos and other public bodies, and the Minister has been living in cloud cuckoo land if he does not recognise that such abuse has occurred.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
Although I accept many of the points made by the hon. Member for Bath, I do not believe that the circular would be necessary if there were to be ballot observers at every ballot. The Minister's refusal to accept this sensible, pragmatic amendment shows that the thrust of the Bill is to pursue a political objective with which most parents with children at state-run
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 358</span>
schools do not agree. If the Minister had accepted the amendment, he would have shown that he was, to a small extent, interested in fairness. Given his attitude, however, I press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 63, in page 16, line 7, after 'ballot', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'and shall publish the contents of the report'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 64, in page 16, line 19, at end inset
<br><blockquote><p>'and '(c) shall receive a copy of the report and all particulars contained therein as soon as reasonably practicable.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: During the discussion on the previous amendment, the Minister made it clear that he thought it appropriate to have a ballot observer only when there was a fair degree of disagreement between the parties involved in the ballot process. The clause proposes that
<br><blockquote><p>"the ballot observer shall make a report to the Secretary of State on the conduct of the ballot".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would simply mean that, once the report had been produced, it should be published. It is important that those who have been party to the ballot process and any acrimony surrounding it—which may have been responsible for the appointment of the ballot observer in the first place—should have some idea of what the observer made of the ballot process and what comments he or she made to the Secretary of State. The parties would then be in a position to understand fully the Secretary of State's subsequent response as to whether the ballot is deemed to have been correct and proper and that its decision should stand or whether the ballot has been declared void. That is an eminently sensible and obvious suggestion, which would not cause the Minister any trouble. I look forward to his response.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows well enough that those who have the privilege to be in government enjoy the enormous support of dedicated officials. Those officials, put a lot of work into the preparation of material and occasionally suffer the disappointment of certain Ministers not making the fullest use of it. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I occasionally like to use the excellent material that they provide to demonstrate to the Committee—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is a great deal of hilarity in the Committee this morning, but the Minister is making a serious speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to, Sir Michael. I like not only to demonstrate the excellence of the material provided but to give myself maximum protection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the Minister heard me apologise from a sedentary position and urge him to give us the benefit of the advice that he has been given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 17 allows the Secretary of State, during the course of a ballot investigation by the Department, to request a report from a ballot observer. Amendment No. 63 would require the publication of that report. Hon. Members will wish to know, if they do not know already, that the Department investigates complaints about grant-maintained ballots carefully to ensure parents of the opportunity of a fair and balanced debate about grant-maintained status.<br><br>
If the procedures for the ballot have not been observed, or if parents have been misled in a way that is likely to have affected the outcome of the ballot, the Secretary of State can declare the ballot void and require it be to rerun. The Secretary of State's decision is explained in some detail to the school, the LEA, the parents who complained and anyone else involved. In addition, Ministers always write to the constituency Member of Parliament.<br><br>
The letter explaining the Secretary of State's decision may often contain criticism of the governors, the LEA or another party. It is therefore a sensitive document. It is open to anyone in receipt of a decision letter to publicise it; not infrequently, that results in press coverage. The result of the investigation is therefore made as public as is necessary.<br><br>
However, we believe that no advantage would be gained by publishing a report from the ballot observer in advance of the Secretary of State's decision being announced. It would not be welcomed by schools or LEAs. Schools encounter enough difficulties in the course of a parents' ballot without yet more publicity. Neither is there a real need to impose a requirement that the governing body and the LEA should receive a copy of a ballot observer's report.<br><br>
Most ballot observer reports are likely to be written at the request of the Secretary of State in the course of a ballot investigation. The Department always writes to the governing body and the LEA, as well as to other complainants, about the Secretary of State's main conclusions on a ballot investigation. A ballot observer could write a report—for instance, about a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 360</span>
particular incident during a ballot—but there may be no ballot investigation because the matter is satisfactorily resolved at the time. In such circumstances, a requirement to distribute a report is surely unnecessary.<br><br>
For all those reasons, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister received some detailed and helpful advice, but was he listening to himself as he read it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I tried.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will he reflect on his statement that he sees little point in publishing a ballot observer's report in advance of the Secretary of State making a decision? Does he therefore believe it important that such reports should be published after the Secretary of State has made a decision? I am following the logic of the Minister's brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The essence of the argument is rather that it may be necessary, as the result of an investigation, to say some rather critical things about individuals or groups—perhaps about the governing body of a school, more rarely about the head teacher or the chairman of the governing body, perhaps about a group of parents or even the local education authority. We must consider how far it would be in the general public interest or in the interests of those individuals to put such findings in the public domain. The school is probably going through a stressful and difficult time, and to publish that information gratuitously—and, I believe, unnecessarily—would exacerbate that. That is the thrust of my argument. Frankly, whether publication comes before or after the Secretary of State's decision is made public may be important, but it is not the central focus.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for at least clarifying his position. However, his response was not only disappointing but slightly surprising. The other part of the brief that he read to the Committee made it clear that the Secretary of State would produce a comprehensive report, which may be critical of one or other of the parties involved in the ballot procedure. That may add to the problems that will follow from what would have been a fairly acrimonious process. However, it will also clear the air for the future, because people will know exactly who said what about them.<br><br>
The Minister's response is inconsistent with the other views expressed by the Department. The most obvious example of that is the Government's decision to publish fully Ofsted reports, even when they contain critical comments about different aspects of the running of the school and about individual members of staff, the governing body or departments within the school. It would be important for us to explore such inconsistency in more detail on another occasion. I am not entirely convinced that the Minister is fully conversant with the details of the brief to the point of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0297">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 361</span>
fully accepting them. To enable further discussion to take place, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 17 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. Earlier, the hon. Member for Attercliffe said that officials had visited Silverdale school in Sheffield without informing the LEA. I wish to put it on the record that my learned Friend the Member for Hallam, who is the Member of Parliament for the constituency in which the school is situated, approached me about the roof repairs to the school. He did so following the reported closure of the school because he was worried that Sheffield city council was neglecting the fabric of its schools.<br><br>
I told my hon. Friend the Member for Hallam that I would ask my officials to inspect the school. They immediately contacted LEA officials to arrange a visit. In fact, officials will be visiting the school on 11 December—tomorrow—and will be accompanied by LEA officials. The officials will also be discussing other routine matters with the LEA. I hope that that puts the record straight and that the hon. Member for Attercliffe will admit that the information he gave to the Committee was incorrect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. I listened carefully to what the Minister said. The explanation that I received from Sheffield city council was that the announcement of the impending visit was made before the local education authority had been consulted, which is different from the explanation given by the hon. Lady. If her officials are now consulting the local council, I am pleased to hear it. I am also pleased that she responded so quickly to a request made by a Member of Parliament to examine a problem with a school building in his constituency. I presume that she will respond just as quickly when I and other Labour colleagues with constituences in Sheffield approach her with similar problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With my customary generosity of spirit, I stretched the Standing Orders slightly to allow that point of order to be made. However, we must now move on.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
PROVISION OF ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE BY FUNDING AUTHORITY,</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 74, in page 16, leave out lines 40 to 42 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(3) Any such assistance shall be provided on terms agreed with the funding authority, subject to the funding authority recouping at a minimum its own costs in providing or arranging the provision of such advice or assistance.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 362</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 160, in page 16,1ine 40, leave out from "may" to "on" in line 41 and insert "only be provided".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is an attempt to put grant-maintained schools and local education authority schools on a level footing in terms of the advice and support that they receive from outside bodies. During the later discussion on amendment No. 171, I shall be arguing that the remit for the Funding Agency for Schools, so beloved of the hon. Member for Walton, has extended significantly since it was first set up to the giving of advice on matters outside its financial remit. I referred to the need for a level playing field. Members of the Committee are aware that in recent years, there has been a growing devolution—which has generally been welcomed by both sides of the Committee and of the House—of power and responsibility to the individual governing bodies of schools. That has increasingly meant that the governing body of an local education authority school is, appropriately, required to determine what organisation will provide a wide range of service support and guidance. It is properly expected that a school should incur the payment for those services out of its delegated budgets, under the process generally known as the local management of schools.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
Grant-maintained schools are also required to pay for the range of services, advice and support that they receive and to do so out of their funding arrangements. Grant-maintained schools have been given a range of responsibilities additional to those given to local education authority schools, but they have also been given an increased sum of money in the funding process to help pay for them. The clause proposes that grant-maintained schools should be able to obtain further advice and support from the FAS. Whether the FAS is the right body to give that advice and support is a separate debate, as is the question of whether the FAS has the capacity to give that advice and support. That is not my point. I say merely that if the FAS is to have its remit broadened to give such advice and support to grant-maintained schools, it would be appropriate for the FAS to recoup the cost of that from the appropriate grant-maintained school. Otherwise, grant-maintained schools would get extra advice and support at no cost to them, which would further exacerbate the funding differentials between grant-maintained schools and local education authority schools. The amendment would ensure that a level playing field in terms of the payment for advice and support between local education authority and grant-maintained schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I speak to amendment No. 160; I do not want to be repetitious and add unnecessarily to what the hon. Member for Bath said. Amendment No. 160 extends the hon. Gentleman's argument by seeking to ensure that the advisory services that the FAS provides to grant-maintained schools and grant-maintained special schools are chargeable to those schools. That would remove the anomalous situation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0298">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 363</span>
of grant-maintained schools being given free ride that local education authority schools are not given. As the hon. Member for Bath pointed out, that harks back to the Opposition's consistent attempts to remind the Government of their commitment—at least, their ostensible commitment—to parity of treatment for schools in both sectors.<br><br>
Grant-maintained schools are already more than adequately funded for their extra responsibilities and we have argued that there is ample evidence to suggest that they are already over-generously funded in comparison with other maintained schools. We want to prevent a further imbalance to the funding regime by requiring that grant-maintained schools be charged for the advisory services they might receive from the Funding Agency for Schools under clause 18.<br><br>
The amendment would not prescribe in any detail the substance of any charging regime; that is a matter for the funding agency and grant-maintained schools to determine. Indeed, in the interests of securing value for money, it would be interesting to see whether the FAS could compete effectively with LEAs and other providers in the market for advisory and support services.<br><br>
I must rise to the bait cast by the hon. Member for Bath. Under a future Labour Government, there would not be grant-maintained schools, so the current role of the FAS would no longer exist. I place it on the record, however, that it would be a terrible dereliction of duty to ignore the body of expertise that has been built up in the executive arm of the FAS. It will be incumbent on a future Labour Government to ensure that that expertise is productively applied in areas most appropriate to their educational policies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take my cue very much from what the hon. Member for Walton has just said. We acknowledge that there is a considerable body of expertise in the FAS. We believe that the agency is now sufficiently mature and relevant to be able—indeed, it should be encouraged—to offer assistance to grant-maintained schools where appropriate. The Committee will know that the Bill fully allows for the agency to make such terms and conditions as it sees fit in the provision of advice and support. It states that
<br><blockquote><p>"such assistance may be provided free of charge or on such terms as to payment as the funding authority may determine".</p></blockquote>
We have certainly envisaged the possiblity for that. At this stage, however, it is surely premature for us to prejudge the nature and extent of the support that the funding agency may give or whether a charging mechanism would be sensible and relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The Minister belongs to a group that shares a market approach to the economy and to education, so he will be aware that the provision of free goods or services leads to a distortion in a free market. Although he talks about the allocation of goods through a simple pricing mechanism, he also believes it necessary to maintain his philosophy on the provision of education and, indeed, health. To divert from that would undermine his own philosophy.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 364</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was going to say that LEAs have enormous flexibility in the way in which they can deploy—and account for—their funds; that is a matter for them. It is perfectly reasonable that the funding agency should be able to provide similar support services, where appropriate, in the grant-maintained sector. The Bill provides great flexibility on that. It would be difficult to prejudge the nature or extent of the support that the agency can rightly give, so I argue that the amendments are unnecessary and should be rejected,</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 178, in page 16, line 44, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>(3) 'After section 23A of that Act there shall be inserted—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"Inspection of funding authority's advice and assistance.</p></blockquote>

You will be aware, Sir Michael, that the Minister and I have served on a number of Committees during this Parliament. I take the Minister back briefly to 19 November 1992 when he and I were in Committee debating the establishment of the Funding Agency for Schools. He will recall that he caused many of us to walk round with far more volumes of paper than we might have imagined. At the time, the Minister said that the bible for the establishment and running of the Funding Agency for Schools was a document entitled "Non-Departmental Public Bodies: A Guide for Departments". I hope that the Minister has brought his copy with him today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0299">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 365</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, the Minister should ask his officials for advice and guidance. The Committee would be interested to know, in view of the significant changes that have taken place to the remit of the Funding Agency for Schools—especially under the Education Act 1993 and the suggested expansion of its responsibilities proposed in clause 18 of the Bill—whether that document is still the bible for the agency's operation or whether there is a new operating manual which is more appropriate. If so, which one is it?<br><br>
My point is simple. The FAS, rightly or wrongly, has changed its remit in the past few years since its inception in 1992. Given that development, we should question whether there should be other checks and balances on the work of the FAS.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall happily give way in a moment when I finish this point. The Minister has rightly suggested that bodies that give advice to schools—I refer to LEAs in particular—should have further controls and checks and balances imposed on them. The Minister is proposing that Ofsted should now inspect the work of LEAs and I agree. I also believe that that same approach should now be applied to the FAS, given that its remit has developed and continues to develop.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that Lord Nolan's report gave a clear indication of the direction that the Government should take?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, the hon. Member for Walton has taken my next point almost out of my mouth. The Government's White Paper, "Self-Government for Schools", referred to Lord Nolan's comments about his concerns about the current division of responsibilities between the Department for Education and Employment, the FAS and Ofsted, which
<br><blockquote><p>"created a risk that any major problems in individual grant maintained schools would not be tackled as effectively as they could be".</p></blockquote>
In response to Nolan, the Government said that the different organisations did work closely together and the White Paper states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Nonetheless, the Government accepts that weaknesses in governance, failures of financial control and poor educational performance can all be interlinked, and that any problems must be tackled vigorously".</p></blockquote>
That is what the Government said.<br><br>
It is, therefore, perfectly understandable—though I am not saying that I agree with it—that clause 18 is now before us as a logical follow-on. It extends the ability of the Funding Agency for Schools to provide a wider range of advice and support to schools, which goes beyond its original remit. But once the Funding Agency for Schools moves into the areas that are covered, for LEA schools, by local education authorities, it seems absolutely appropriate that the same checks and balances should apply to that new range of advice and support.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 366</span>
12.45 pm<br><br>
The amendment would provide that the chief inspector of Ofsted or the Secretary of State, or both, would have the opportunity to investigate and examine the work of the Funding Agency for Schools in the same way as they do for local education authorities. Again, I am sure that the Minister will see the sense of our argument, both in terms of fairness and equity and in the checking of the work of the Funding Agency for Schools, which is so highly regarded by the hon. Member for Walton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that there are members of the Committee and, almost certainly, people outside who wish that the hon. Member for Bath was right. People outside might like the idea of the Funding Agency for Schools being effectively a super-duper LEA, if that is what he is saying. Who knows, perhaps people in the FAS might like that idea. Regrettably, perhaps, I do not see it that way. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the funding agency was set up only in 1993 following the wonderful Education Act 1993. Many of my hon. Friends were members of the Committee for that Bill in 1992; indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) is smiling with delight at the memory.<br><br>
I recall that during that Committee, we had many discussions about the nature of the funding agency and its accountability—I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bath for quoting me yet again. Several references were made to non-departmental public bodies and the guidelines that refer thereto. However, the hon. Gentleman made an uncharacteristic error in trying to make the case that the Funding Agency for Schools has had its role significantly enhanced, even within the modest proposals of clause 18, and has therefore approached the status of an LEA. That is a bit of an exaggeration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister wishes to sustain the argument that he is now making, he must explain clearly his understanding of new section 23A(b) in clause 18(2). It refers to the type of advice and assistance that is to be given
<br><blockquote><p>"in connection with the discharge by the governing body of any of their functions in relation to the government or conduct of the school."</p></blockquote>
Surely that refers to almost everything that the school does, which means that the role of the FAS in terms of giving advice and guidance is significantly enhanced from its role heretofore.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is probably not. We do not have to read too much into the words that the hon. Gentleman quoted. It is well known that the Funding Agency for Schools has developed much expertise—as the hon. Member for Walton generously conceded—in matters financial and managerial. However, its role in education and curriculum matters is as yet undeveloped.<br><br>
With regard to accountability, we know that the funding agency has a corporate plan, an annual report and annual accounts that are signed off by the Comptroller and Auditor General, that it works within the context of the financial memorandum
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0300">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 367</span>
between the agency and the Department and that it is subject to audit by the National Audit Office. I should have thought that the Funding Agency for Schools is supervised to hell, if I can put it that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me take the Minister back a moment or two. I accept his contention that the FAS is not a super LEA, but does he agree that it is becoming a hybrid of the LEA and the Department?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not. I am privileged to have several agencies under my benign gaze. Agencies generally have become robustly independent expert bodies, which are statutorily charged with certain important responsibilities. That applies also to the Employment Service with its jobcentres or the Teacher Training Agency. That is a healthy development. Opposition Members may not be pleased to hear this, but it means that politicians and Ministers have much less day-to-day influence over the conduct of matters for which agencies are responsible. I sometimes ask people who quiz me on the issue whether they would want politicians such as myself to have more or less influence over day-to-day events. Occasionally, a delegation wants to see me about the conduct of an agency, and I put the question to them too. Opposition Members are pondering it now because they had not thought of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that Opposition Members would prefer elected politicians, not appointed politicians who pass under another guise, to exercise authority?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised by the hon. Gentleman's words. One of the big differences between us is that he would prefer Ministers to have their fingers in every conceivable activity throughout government, rather than properly distancing themselves from operational matters and allowing experts to get on with them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I served on the Select Committee on Public Service, we considered the status of agencies and their relationship to Departments. Some functions, which were not highly political matters, were, quite reasonably, passed down from Departments to agencies. When we considered agencies such as the Prison Service or the Benefits Agency, which dealt with matters with a high political content that were of concern to hon. Members, they did not appear to function well as agencies unless there was a clear understanding of when the Minister got involved.<br><br>
Some of the functions that we are considering require the Minister to get stuck in, while others can be left to an agency's officials or chief executive. Members of the Select Committee disagreed a little with the Government about who should give evidence to Select Committees. Why can chief executives not give their own evidence when they have to relay Ministers' policy? That shows that there is still a relationship and that politically sensitive issues in particular are a matter for the Minister. He should think a little further and discriminate between functions, some of which may require him to exercise personal responsibility.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 368</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a long intervention. I am sure that I speak for my co-Chairman when I ask hon. Members to make their interventions brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Sir Michael, for reminding us that that was an intervention. I had forgotten that I was making a speech, as most members of the Committee probably had, too.<br><br>
I invite the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) to leave the Room with his hon. Friend the hon. Member for Walton at an appropriate time—not while he is listening to my riveting contribution—and to have a chat about the matter because there is clearly a difference between them. The hon. Gentleman concedes that agency independence has a valuable function in government. The hon. Member for Walton—greedy to get his hands on the levers of power—wants to intervene in almost anything that moves in government. I shall leave it to Opposition Members to sort that out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister wilfully misinterprets what I said. The record will show that I would prefer effective decisions to be taken by elected Ministers, not by politicians, whatever their political hue, who have been appointed to quangos. Such decisions were rightly and properly within the remit of accountable Ministers until the principle of agencies was extended, extremely partially, by the current Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To enable us to move on, as you, Sir Michael, would wish, I should say that we can all agree that since the benign influence of Nolan was brought to bear on those matters, even the mere suggestion of political appointments has effectively become impossible. We are reassured that that will be the case for the future. That would apply to the funding agency as much as to any other.<br><br>
The essence of the argument is simple. Because of the reasonable and modest provisions in the Bill and the flexibilities that are provided therein, it is unnecessary to give the amendment effect, I ask the Committee to oppose it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response is disappointing, not least because he will no doubt attempt to persuade the Committee that Ofsted inspections to be carried out under clause 54, particularly those of the quality and quantity of advice and assistance given by an LEA to its schools, are vital. It is bizarre that the Minister does not believe that the same degree of professional scrutiny should be given to the FSA when it gives similar advice to grant-maintained schools. I do not think that that inequality is acceptable to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must put the record straight. The hon. Member for Bath will have heard the Minister mention the pristine and brave new world of the quangocracy, which is open to scrutiny post-Nolan. As far as I am aware, Nolan made no reference to the role of the public appointments unit within No. 10. Will the hon. Gentleman comment on that? I put down more than 800 questions to try to find out exactly who sat on the quangos. Question after question—

[<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister says from a sedentary position that it was a waste of taxpayers' money, but I had to do it because of the secrecy of the Government's approach.<br><br>
Will the Minister comment on the fact that Nolan made no reference to the public appointments unit and its role in appointing people to posts on what he says is a non-party political basis?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Any dilation on matters such as the Nolan appointments unit would be stretching my patience considerably.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That, Sir Michael, is the very point that I was about to make to explain why I would be unable to respond to the eloquent and well-made point of the hon. Member for Walton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot give way to the hon. Gentleman. This matter is vital and the Committee must divide so that at least we know where people stand.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 9.</p>

POWER OF SECRETARY OF STATE TO ARRANGE STATUS OF GRANT-MAINTAINED SCHOOLS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'8 After section 266 of the Education Act 1996 there shall be inserted—

<li>for the Secretary of State to direct that any school to which subsection (I) of section 266A of this Act applies shall cease to be a grant maintained school and shall instead be a school maintained by the local education authority in whose area the school is situated and for the Secretary of State to take further provision consequent upon such a direction; or</li>
<li>for the Secretary of State to direct that the local education authority in whose area the school is situated shall have the power to appoint such number of additional governors to the governing body of the school as the Secretary of State may specify in such a direction.".'.—[<i>Mr. Kilfoyle.</i>]</li></ol></ul></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall take the point of order after I have put the Question. The Question is, That the clause be read a Second time. Those in favour say Aye. To the contrary, No.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Noes have it.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it is very likely that that will be available this afternoon. To avoid any possible confusion, I have tried to make sure that members of the Committee had the opportunity to consider the matter very clearly. I put the Question again and I hope that the hon.
