	<p>[MR. EDWARD O'HARA 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Education Bill</h1></div>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been given notice of a point of order from the Opposition, so I call that before we continue our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Kilfoyle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Walton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. The point of order arises from this morning's vote against clause 3 stand part. I would have mentioned the rumour that the Government intend to use the tags that they propose for nursery-age children on some of their errant Back-Bench Members, but I am sure, Mr. O'Hara, that you would rule it out of order and that the hon. Members for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall) and for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) would take it amiss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More seriously, we believe that there is now a case for requesting the complete withdrawal of part I chapter II of the Bill. At least, we could argue that the Committee adjourn its consideration of the rest of the chapter. Part of clause 7 is now meaningless and several clauses have lost their purpose or no longer carry the same consequences—notably clause 6 and especially clauses 9 and 10. The key proposal for grant-maintained school expansion has been removed from the Bill and, as a result, so has the intended interaction with the expansion of selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to explain why the Government should make a statement. Clause 3 dealt with the enlargement of the premises of grant-maintained schools, removing the need to publish proposals where the increase in capacity did not exceed 50 per cent., or 30 pupils, whichever was the greater. The subsequent two clauses outline other, separate exceptions to the procedure. The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that clauses 6 to 10—the bulk of part I chapter II—either result from or operate in the context of the changes made under clauses 3 to 5. The immediate question is whether all those clauses have had their meaning or context so altered by the loss of clause 3 that the Committee cannot logically proceed in its consideration of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give some specific examples of the apparent consequences. Clause 3 would have inserted a new section—section 259A—into the Education Act 1966, so its removal alters the meaning in clause 4 of page 5 lines 11 to 12, which state that
	<br><q><p>"'the publication procedure' means the provisions of sections 259 to 263".</p></q>
Page 6 line 43 in clause 6 concerns whether
	<br><q><p>"any enlargement of the premises of the school"</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>250</span>
would require consultation. Although the wording stands, the meaning is altered. The explanatory memorandum states that that provision arises as a result of clause 3. Similarly, page 7 line 44 refers to
	<br><q><p>"the provisions of sections 259 to 263".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am on a point of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 7, page 8 line 35 refers specifically to section 259A, which has now been lost—it is therefore meaningless. The clause should be withdrawn or amended, because the proposed new section 266A(2)(a) refers to a case in which the publication procedure
	<br><q><p>"did not apply initially, by virtue of section 259A".</p></q>
Likewise under clause 7, the proposed subsection (4) refers to "sections 259 to 263".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory memorandum also states that the new procedure provided for under clauses 9 and 10 arises
	<br><q><p>"as a consequence of the relaxation of controls on enlarging schools' capacity"</p></q>
provided for under clause 3. Although the words make sense by themselves, the purpose and meaning have been fundamentally altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek your guidance, Mr. O'Hara, on whether we can at least expect a statement from the Minister as to his intentions for any consequential amendments. What will they be, and at what stage of our proceedings will they be tabled for debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I can understand the hon. Gentleman seeking to make a little mischief with the events of this morning—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Such occasions are rare, but not unprecedented. It may help members of the Committee if I draw their attention to events that took place on 22 April 1970, when the Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons, Mr. Fred Peart, said in the House:
	<br><q><p>"On Tuesday last week the Government"—</p></q>
that is, Mr. Peart's Government—
	<br><q><p>"lost by one vote an important Division in the Committee stage on the Education Bill. That is not unusual; other Governments have do so.… I can recall a number of occasions when Governments have temporarily lost some or all of a piece of legislation."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 22 April 1970; Vol. 800, c. 456.]</p></q>
I quote that to put this morning's events in context and to show that they have a precedent. It is something with which the House occasionally has to deal. Subject to further advice, the Government will seek to reinstate clause 3 on Report. We do not share the interpretation of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle), who ingeniously sought to establish that the loss of clause 3 affects the rest of the Bill. The Committee should continue its normal consideration of the Bill, as approved on Second Reading, on the understanding that the Government will seek to reinstate clause 3 on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. There may have been instances of a Government losing a Division, but to lose a clause is a different matter. I realise that Governments seek on Report to win Divisions that they have previously lost, but in our debate this afternoon we shall refer to the substance of clause 3 which is no longer part of the Bill. Second Reading, which concerns the principle of a Bill, is not the same as the Committee stage, which concerns the line by line, word by word examination of a Bill. I fail to see how the Committee can discuss line by line and word by word a clause that is no longer part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Would not the commonsense way of tackling the dilemma be to vote again to see whether—[	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that a weighty contribution is being made, but I cannot hear it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to you, Mr. O'Hara. I was trying to follow the good point made by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris). To enable the considered discussion of the Committee to continue, why should not we vote again to see whether the Committee confirms its original decision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot respond to that in the affirmative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. The Government have a built-in majority and yet they failed to use it on a Division on clause stand part. It is all very well for the Minister to quote a member of a Labour Government speaking in the House 26 years ago, but he made no reference to what was under debate. We know that he was speaking on an education Act, but we do not know whether it was an amendment that took out a whole clause. Until the matter is sorted out, it would be ludicrous to debate amendments to later clauses; they will not have the same meaning because clause 3 is no longer part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I earnestly entreat you, Mr. O'Hara, to adjourn the Committee so that we can further discuss how to get the Government out of the mess that they are in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I seek your advice. To try to get out of the present tangle, the Minister said that he would bring the clause back on Report. It is my reading of Standing Orders that one cannot reintroduce on Report a clause that has been removed from the Bill in Committee. If I am correct, it must follow that the new clause will be at variance with the clause that we debated this morning. If it is different, we ought to know what provisions it will contain, because it will affect other parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore imperative that we adjourn, to allow the Government to decide what the new clause which will miraculously emerge on Report will say, and what impact it will have on those parts of the Bill that we are to consider in future sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>252</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. May I urge you, in coming to a decision on this important matter, to give considerable weight to the opinion of the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey)? You will be aware that the hon. Member for Yardley made a succinct point—that the removal of clause 3 would make it difficult to discuss subsequent amendments. You will recall that only a few moments ago, the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth said of that contribution that the hon. Lady had made a good point. I hope, Mr. O'Hara, that you will bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara—it is a genuine point of order. Is it in order for a Committee to vote on a clause that makes reference to a clause that no longer exists, or to agree to an amendment that refers to section 259A, which itself is referred to in what was once clause 3—a clause that is no longer part of the Bill? In other words, can we debate an amendment or vote on a clause that refers to parts of the Bill that no longer exist?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Later in the Committee's deliberations, I shall move new clause 1. Why should it be impossible to move a "new" clause 3?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I shall pay no attention to the specious and facile point of order first made by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. We cannot be held to account for the Government's failure to meet their commitments. The hon. Member for Hendon, South had rushed off for a photo opportunity with the Prime Minister's wife and the hon. Member for Wyre Forest was rushing around the House trying to find him, like Wee Willie Winkie running through the night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's failure to get clause 3 through will have a real effect on subsequent clauses. I urge you, Mr. O'Hara, to adjourn the Committee so that the Government can at least prepare a statement instead of trying to pass the incident off, as did the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gravesham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have heard enough and can respond. I have listened carefully and have followed the points that referred to particular pages of the Bill. Various implications were pointed out, which in my judgment are minimal, and I believe that the Government can cope with them. The onus is on the Government to cope with them if they are not as minimal as I believe them to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of whether a new clause can be introduced on Report, I am advised that there is precedent for that. There will be many opportunities to table new clauses and amendments both in Committee and on Report. The selection of new clauses on Report is a matter for Madam Speaker, and there are many precedents for that too.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>253</span>
It is not for the Chair to adjourn the Committee on such a point of order. The Committee must determine whether to adjourn; I decline to adjourn the Committee from the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I want the Committee to adjourn to give the Government a chance to consider the impact of the loss of clause 3 this morning on subsequent clauses in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to move, That further consideration be now adjourned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. This morning, we debated at great length a number of amendments to clause 3, referring to
	<br><q><p>"Relaxation of controls on enlargement of premises",</p></q>
and we are proceeding this afternoon on amendments to clause 4, which deals with
	<br><q><p>"Relaxation of controls on changes relating to selective admissions."</p></q>
It is quite clear that the two subjects are different and that one does not relate to the other. Bearing in mind the fact that we have all come back this afternoon, may we please get on with discussing the amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Opposition have moved a dilatory motion. Usually such motions are moved by the Government, but in the particular circumstances of the debate, I am prepared to accept the dilatory motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given what happened near the end of this morning's very interesting sitting—the Government lost a Division by one vote—it is clear that the Conservative party is practising for opposition. It is interesting that we complained earlier that we often won the argument in Committee but never the Division. Just after the Minister of State said that he treated all amendments on their merits, we were most surprised to win a Division. I felt a little sorry for the Government Whip—having one Member elsewhere is unfortunate, but having two absent must be sheer carelessness. I hope that he will be able to "marshal" his troops during future Divisions. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I assure the Minister of State that it did not take me four hours to work out that one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are not, as amendments often are, wrecking or probing amendments; they are sensible. I shall argue briefly but carefully why they are essential if the Bill is to make any sense as an Act of Parliament. By tabling new clause 4, I seek to bring to the Government's notice a worthy, commonsense suggestion, which would deal with failing grant-maintained schools. I notice that the Minister of State has his pen poised and I look forward to his full response to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment Nos. 92, 93 and 94 would ensure that grant-maintained schools which were deemed to be failing—those requiring special measures—could not consider selection while they were considered to be in need of such measures. It is interesting to note the comments on the features of failing schools in the White Paper that preceded the Education Act 1993, in which it was suggested that education associations should be created. It was suggested that failing schools might include those that had serious shortcomings in their curriculum or problems with their standing in the local community. But the most important shortcomings that the Government identified were serious failings in management. In fact, paragraph 11.11 of the White Paper—which the then Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>255</span>
State, the right hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Mr. Patten), said came from his own hand during the previous summer—stated:
	<br><q><p>"In particular, the EA will be expected to provide the essential leadership and management that has previously been lacking at the school."</p></q>
The Government are saying that the management of a school which requires special measures is clearly failing or lacking. How strange, then, that a school that is deemed to require special measures—one that is failing—can consider whether to select up to 20 per cent. of its intake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is going to tell us why.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not need to tell the Committee why; I did so this morning, although you were regrettably not in the Chair, Mr. O'Hara. I could repeat the explanation as many times as the hon. Gentleman wants; or, indeed, as many times as you would allow, Mr. O'Hara. Near the end of this morning's sitting, I explained clearly why freedom should be given to a failing grant-maintained school to exercise the right to introduce an element of selection if it thought that that would contribute to its improvement. It is as simple as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the Minister is telling us that the management of a failing school should not consider improving the school, its curriculum or putting right any of its failings, but should begin a substantial change to the school's nature. Under the Bill, a failing management can discuss whether the school should be selective without recourse to the local community, the local education authority or even the parents. That is absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that any member of the Committee would think that the priority of a failing school should be to consider whether it should change its nature and take in a cohort of more able pupils. Surely its priority should be to find out what was wrong with the management, where it was failing and to seek advice on such matters long before it considered whether to go selective. I should have thought that a school that had been deemed to be failing would at least need five years in which to settle down and demonstrate that it was successful before it tried fundamentally to change its nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By definition, it is not just the head teacher who may be failing the school, but the governors and others. On the role of education associations, paragraph 11.12 of the White Paper states:
	<br><q><p>"It is that community involvement which will be essential to the future success of the schools concerned."</p></q>
Yet we heard earlier that community involvement in the school is no longer required. A failing grant-maintained school will be able to consider going selective, even though four years ago the Government were saying that community involvement was essential to the future success of schools. They are now saying
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>256</span>
that that is no longer necessary and that failing grant-maintained schools can consider going selective without consultation. That is an absurd assertion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to an excellent point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) this morning, the Minister said that there were measures to protect poor and inefficient schools. Well, the clause contains a further distracting measure, prompting grant-maintained schools to divert themselves from the major issue of improving so as to discuss whether to go partly or wholly selective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to delay the Committee further on amendments Nos. 92, 93 and 94 because the case for them is so strong. The suggestion that a failing grant-maintained school should be able to consider going selective is absurd. Axiomatically, Opposition Members consider that nonsense, and there is no point in pursuing the matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Staffordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the Minister correctly, when a grant-maintained school is failing, Ofsted—the hit squad—will not be brought in; nor will the LEA, the management or governors of the school be hauled over the coals. They will not be seen to be failing; the intake will be regarded as failing. It will be thought that, if a school becomes more selective, it will have a better intake. What will be the effect of that on other schools in the area? Will they not become enfeebled, given that their intake of youngsters will be less able? Consequently, the problem will be passed on instead of being sorted out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point—the management and governors can blame the pupils for a school's perceived failure. We do not believe that pupils are the cause of a school failing and being at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What my hon. Friend has actually anticipated now and why we need, in addition to this, new clause 4 is the fact that new clause 4 brings into being action that can be taken in the case of a grant-maintained school that is falling.

5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had this discussion during the passage of the 1993 Act; we discussed the difference between the attention that a failing county LEA school gets and what a failing grant-maintained school gets. This is not a political point but I see no reason why a grant-maintained school is not just as able as a county or LEA school actually to fail in its management. In fact, schools that do not have the backing and expertise of their LEA sometimes find themselves in difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members like to talk about London experiences. We know that the Stratford school went through very considerable difficulties over a period of time, but what was significant about that particular school was the difficulty that the Government then had in handling certain of its failures. The measures were not in place to take the sort of action that would really have had an effect on bringing that school around. I believe the only real measures that can be taken are to make alterations to the governing body by bringing in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>257</span>
new governors and that, in itself, wag hardly an adequate response to a school that was seriously failing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contrast that with what happens to an LEA school that is failing. The school governors have to come up with an action plan in eight weeks in which they have to set out what plan of action they have for the improvement of the school. The LEA has a role in that. Ultimately, the LEA, if it feels that the school is failing badly enough, can withdraw its delegation of funds. If that does not work, then the education association can be called in and, in fact, in a couple of cases it has been called into schools. Ultimately, the school can either be closed or, curiously under the previous legislation, the school can become grant-maintained. In other words, it can go out of the remit of the local authority and actually become separated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason we need new clause 4, which gives local education authorities the responsibility for improving grant-maintained schools that are clearly failing, is that it allows the Secretary of State to bring in those much wider measures that are needed for the improvement of a school and which are not available to a grant-maintained school. I noticed that in our earlier proceedings the Minister spoke, sometimes quite witheringly, about local education authorities; he clearly has not read fully, or perhaps he did not even write, the White Paper that preceded this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That particular White Paper sets out a very clear role for LEAs, particularly in relation to quality. I refer the Minister to page 49, part 6, (f) and (g), which refers to an LEA's role as promoting quality in school. (g) mentions
	<br><q><p>"Co-ordinating school networks and developing good practice".</p></q>
I would agree with that. I do not know if the Minister agrees with it, but those are measures which could be activated for a failing grant-maintained school. Page 54, section 30, states:
	<br><q><p>"LEAs may often want to draw expertise from beyond their own staff, including staff from good local schools."</p></q>
That is another example where even the Government can see that a local education authority can bring to bear expertise that would not normally be available in a grant-maintained school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, the Government say on page 53, on quality assurance:
	<br><q><p>"There is a major issue about the part LEAs should play in promoting higher standards in schools".</p></q>
We agree with all those points. I am not sure that the Minister actually agrees with the substance of those points, contained in his own White Paper, but new clause 4 allows a local education authority, and hence the community and even central Government, to take the proper action in the case of a grant-maintained school that has been clearly deemed to be failing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The early amendments take away the ability of that school to divert attention from its major problems by saying that it will go selective. If the clause were accepted as it stands, it would be not only extraordinary but perverse to allow a failing school to go even 20 per cent. selective. I trust that the Minister will see the good sense at least of not permitting
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>258</span>
schools that are failing—we are told that as many as 2 per cent. of certain schools could be failing—to go selective. New clause 4 allows for proper action to be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty for the Committee at this point is that there is a danger that the hon. Gentleman on the one hand, and I, on the other, will be arguing arguments on parallel tracks which, regrettably, can never meet. The hon. Gentleman, with all his perspicacity and erudition and his great experience of education, still has not quite come to grips with what a grant-maintained school is or means. The hon. Gentleman keeps on talking about grant-maintained schools as though they somehow relied on, or need some link to, the local education authority to support them or help them, even when they are deemed to be failing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trouble with that analysis is that it is directly at odds with the whole idea of grant-maintained status. The Committee will recall that maintained status is a status deliberately separate from local education authorities; it is established by parental ballot and designed by the management and parents of the school. It carries with it freedoms and autonomies, and also responsibilities which the school then has to allocate apart from the local education authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister used a vital word. He said that grant-maintained status gives the ability to discharge responsibilities, but a failing school, by definition, is failing in its responsibilities. The question I put to the Minister, therefore, is what substantial action can be taken where a grant-maintained school is failing in its responsibilities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will come to that in a moment. The hon. Gentleman gave a clue as to the answer a moment ago. The Secretary of State has the power to appoint governors to such a school. The hon. Gentleman shrugs dismissively. It is a rather important measure—not something to be dismissed out of hand. In a freestanding, autonomous grant-maintained school, the appointment of governors is a crucial step. Of course we want to challenge the school—as we do in the local education authority sector—if it has been deemed to be failing, to come up with credible plans for self-improvement. If those plans were to include an element of selection, who am I—or who, indeed, is the hon. Gentleman—to stand in the Committee and say, before we even know the circumstances of the school, why it has failed or anything about its environment, that this is one thing that cannot or must not be done? The hon. Gentleman would say that because he is dogmatically and blindly opposed to selection in any circumstances. We believe that selection has an important part to play in improving education in some circumstances and we believe that freedom should be given, even in such a case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's argument is predicated on his belief that grant-maintained schools should be entirely free of local education authorities. That is what the Minister has just told the Committee. Can he then explain why the Funding Agency for

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>259</span>
Schools bulletin No. 14 which I received only today, contains a clear indication of the joint working that is necessary for sensible strategic planning between the grant-maintained schools sector and the LEA? May I, in what will not be a lengthy intervention, read a small section and place it on the record? Talking about London, FAS says:
	<br><q><p>"This cross-border responsibility gives the Agency a unique perspective on the demand for schools places in London. This complements the local focus of the LEA's and enables the Agency to collaborate with the LEA's to convert population projections into pupil forecasts."</p></q>
Is not that a very good example of the need for grant-maintained schools and the LEA's to work together on strategic planning? That is what the FAS believes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman read that with a straight face and I recall the same hon. Member for Bath sitting through the Committee proceedings on the 1992 Education Bill saying over and over and over again that when the Funding Agency for Schools was set up and made responsible for the grant-maintained sector it would cause unremitting chaos and confusion and a complete inability for that agency to work in harmony with local education authorities. Now he stands up quoting, apparently with approval, the Funding Agency for Schools circular saying just what I predicted it would do and what he denied it would do. He now has the brass neck to pray that in aid. I have heard it all now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And now another member of that Standing Committee is going to add to the confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way. That was just a load of bluster because it is irrelevant to the point that the hon. Member for Bath made. In this particular case there is successful collaboration, yet the Minister does not seem to want to accept that the LEA can have this positive role, that it does have an impact on grant-maintained schools and that what my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport said in moving the amendment is absolutely correct. If the Minister is showing sound common sense, as he has done once or twice in his life, he ought to accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a tempting offer. The other conclusion that arose from the hon. Member for Bath's intervention is that a distinction can be made, and properly should be made, between a strategic planning role for the Funding Agency for Schools in the grant-maintained sector or in stage 3 authority areas—which is inherent in the agency's responsibilities—and the discussion of what a single grant-maintained school which has been deemed to be failing should do. The two are quite separate and distinct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. Will he follow through the logic of his own argument? If he is correct in what he says, does he, therefore, believe that a grant-maintained school that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>260</span>
makes any significant change of character should at least—and this is not even on the face of the Bill—get the approval of the Funding Agency for Schools for that move?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that all schools—grant-maintained and local education authority schools—can already make up to a 15 per cent. change in their character without these prior bureaucracies and approvals. All we are talking about here is a possible switch from 15 to 20 per cent. It is the point I wanted to make in response to the hon. Member for Devonport. Really, the argument here is not between zero and 20 per cent. as could have been implied, although I am sure unintentionally, by the hon. Gentleman. It is going from 15 to 20 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know. I said it could have been implied and now I am setting the record straight in order to help the hon. Gentleman and the Committee generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us get this in persepctive. We are talking about that degree of change. My contention is that not only is that unthreatening in a general sense, but, even in terms of the failing school picture which we are now discussing, it is entirely appropriate, acceptable and understandable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Minister back to the debate and the point he was answering about allowing failing schools to extend or introduce selection? Will he agree with me that when a school changes the nature of its intake, which is what selection is about, there are new challenges facing the school in terms of management, the curriculum, pupil and teacher organisation? If he accepts that, and by the nod of his head he appears to be doing so, what makes him think that a failing school has the management skills and the morale actually to cope with those major changes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to make that judgment standing here in this Committee at this stage in our deliberations. That judgment will be made primarily by the management of the school in its assessment of why the school has been deemed to be failing and in its production of a plan to improve it. If that management were to make a judgment that an element of selection might help the school to improve that is something which should be considered and looked at by them. I cannot prejudge that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may seem to Opposition Members that this is an unlikely set of circumstances. I cannot even judge that. I can only say again, before I give way to the hon. Lady, that the Government's view is that it is proper to give the school management that degree of discretion rather than deny it in an absolute sense. That, I think, is the difference between us, and it is quite an important difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not a school that is deemed to be failing or in need of special measures produce a plan which goes to Ofsted for approval so that

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>261</span>
arrangements can be made for the school to improve? The notion that everything is left to the school, with no influence from anybody else, is not the case. There is already a body that intervenes to make sure that the improvement programme is acceptable and good. We cannot really argue that schools are left to get on with it regardless of what anybody else says. The very fact that Ofsted has to approve the improvement plan would seem to be an acceptance that there is a framework within which improvement actions will take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my original question: why does the Minister think that a school which has a failing management would be able to meet the challenges that introducing or extending selection would bring to any school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Lady has helped me; I am always grateful for any help that I can get, from whatever quarter. Yes, the hon. Lady is absolutely right in her analysis, but surely that strengthens the argument that if a school management were to put a plan to Ofsted—as she rightly points out—it is for the school to judge whether it thinks that Ofsted would believe that an element of selection was an acceptable or possibly, on occasion, even an essential, part of the improvement. I do not think that we are at odds here. I do not think that this is a problem. I am arguing that it seems right to us to allow for the possibility, if it seems sensible, of a school changing up to 20 per cent. of its character if it wishes to do so. Ofsted must then make its judgement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem I have with the amendments is that the Opposition are constantly trying to block the options which are available to a school to improve itself, even if it is deemed to be failing. That is the difference between us. It is an important difference and one that we have to resolve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for new clause 4, I think it arises apparently from the hon. Member for Devonport's misunderstanding of the nature of a grant-maintained school. Our view is that grant-maintained schools generally are almost by definition successful because they are created by the process of a parental ballot and support and are desired by a thrusting, dynamic, forward-looking management. They are, therefore, generally a success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as Opposition Members know, it is entirely possible—it has happened occasionally—for a grant-maintained school to be deemed to be failing. In those circumstances, rather than replicate the procedures for local education authority schools, it was decided in the Education Act 1993 that, because grant-maintained schools are different by their nature, it was appropriate that there should be a different procedure for them even when they are failing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would claim, in contrast to what the hon. Member for Devonport said, that that process has been tested and has been proved to be workable, operable and able to function in terms of the separate nature of the grant-maintained school sector and the individual cases where it has taken place. For the hon. Gentleman, therefore, to try to re-import a role for the local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>262</span>
education authority to the grant-maintained sector under the guise of failing schools is clever, but we have spotted it. I do not think it will work. Nor should it work, for the important reason that it denies the separate nature and existence of grant-maintained schools. It is also unnecessary because it suggests—wrongly in my view—that the existing procedure for the improvement of failing grant-maintained schools is inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all these reasons, I believe that the amendments are unnecessary. I ask the Committee to reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was at his least convincing in that response to this particular debate. One can often tell when the Minister is not sure of his argument because he gets louder and bounces around more energetically than he does normally. If we had suggested to the Minister that all one had to do in a failing LEA school was to pop in a few extra governors, he would have laughed us out of the Room. He would have said that that was absurd and that it was nowhere near sufficient to improve the school. But of course with a grant-maintained school we know there is the lightness of touch to which the Minister often refers. Essentially the Minister is saying to the management of the school, the governors and others who are running it—people who are already, by definition, failing—"You can, as a failed body, now make further decisions that fundamentally change education provision but not only in that school because it will probably have a considerable knock-on effect on other schools in the locality."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend will have been struck by the Minister's insistence that all in the garden is rosy and that grant-maintained schools are operating perfectly well. Would he like to speculate, therefore, on why they Government feel the need in, I think, clause 18 to provide a fresh role for the Funding Agency for Schools in giving support and advice to grant-maintained schools if they do not need it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, my hon. Friend makes an excellent and interesting point. I daresay that we will fully expose that issue when we get to clause 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is very fond of saying that such things as schools that are failing and, what action should be taken are not for him. He said that the legislation is permissive—a word he used early on in our proceedings. I agree that it is a permissive piece of legislation, but why permit a failing body to get worse? Why permit it to have powers that could make it substantially worse for the children who are in the school already? This is one piece of permissiveness that I would certainly not want to be undertaken by a failing body. A grant-maintained school that is failing should have measures applied to it similar to those that are applied to other schools. Because I am wholly unconvinced by the Minister's response, I wish to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 146, in page 6, line 12, leave out from 'age' to end of line 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to ensure that no entirely new nursery capacity is created that overrides the safeguard relating to effective planning and use of resources. The clause removes the existing safeguard and will end the statutory procedures for nursery expansion, leaving it to the governing body of a school wanting to create new nursery provision to decide to what extent it should consult. The Minister has given assurances, in relation to selection, that the Department for Education and Employment and the Welsh Office will provide a framework of guidance on consultation which will ensure that proper consultation takes place. Part of the purpose of the amendment is therefore to discover whether the Government also intend that where a grant-maintained primary school decides to extend its provision to nursery education, there will be proper local consultation on the impact of the proposal on the surrounding area. We seek to ensure
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>264</span>
that LEAs will be consulted because the clause seems to pay little or no regard to LEAs' existing provision, their plans for expansion or the possibility of nursery provision on which they have had no say making financial impositions on LEAs. Decisions could be taken without LEAs having had the opportunity of responding in a balanced way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause seems to renege on the reverse earlier Government decisions. I draw the Committee's attention to a letter sent by the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Hornchurch (Mr. Squire) on what happens when a grant-maintained primary school wants to introduce nursery provision. In that letter, dated 22 February 1994, he said:
	<br><q><p>"In a situation where a self-governing school wants to increase the number of nursery places it already offers, or wishes to introduce such provision for the first time, a decision must first be taken as to whether this constitutes a 'significant change of character' of the school. The introduction of a nursery class for the first time or extension of existing nursery provision by a full year would be regarded as a 'significant change'. Other changes might also be regarded in the same light, but these would need to be determined in the context of an individual proposal."</p></q>
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from the letter that the Government believe that, when a self-governing school introduces nursery provision for the first time, there should be proper consultation, as it constitutes a significant change. Clause 5 represents a complete reversal of that stated policy, but the relevant authorities have received no appropriate notice other than the Bill. If the Government wanted to be consistent, they would be happy to accept the amendment. On second thoughts, given that one consistent element in the Government's education policies has been their very inconsistency, perhaps we cannot expect them to veer from piling up inconsistencies clause by clause and Bill by Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 5, the arbitrary establishment of new nursery provision will disrupt the funding process for self-governing schools. At present those schools are funded either through the annual maintenance grant or the common funding formula. The introduction, virtually without notice, of new nursery provision in grant-maintained schools could undermine that funding process, which is currently subject to a well-established planning procedure under which local authorities know exactly what their obligations will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nursery education for three-year-olds is currently discretionary, and is not directly provided for under the standing spending assessment. Under the nursery voucher scheme that will operate, albeit briefly, before the Bill is enacted—if, indeed, it is—nursery education for four-year-olds will be determined by parental request, but it will be limited to the £1,100 that the Government propose to make available for each part-time nursery place; it will not be covered by the revenue settlement for local government in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grant-maintained schools will be able to claw back revenue from the local education authority but, as far as I can determine, there will be no provision for that in the local government settlements in England or Wales. Will the Minister explain how the funding of the new
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0245">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>265</span>
nursery provision for three and four-year-olds will be provided for through the grant settlement made to local authorities? I can understand partial provision being made through the nursery voucher, but what will happen if, for example, the cost of places in grant-maintained schools for four-year-olds is more than £1,100? Will parents be expected to provide that entirely out of their own pockets, or will it somehow be taken out of the local authority's money, which is provided under either the common funding formula or the annual maintenance grant?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That needs to be sorted out because, once again in the letter of February 1994, the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Hornchurch, made some pertinent reference to funding. Writing to the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, he said:
	<br><q><p>"Before approving a capacity change for nursery provision, we would need to be satisfied that there was a need for such an increase and that it met the requirement of ensuring cost-effective use of public money. The existing policy of the relevant LEA for the area would also be taken into account."</p></q>
It seems that new subsection (1)(b) in clause 5 will remove that consideration. For example, sufficient places may already be provided for four-year-olds but a grant-maintained school could provide additional places without needing to consult the LEA, thereby undermining the Under-Secretary's worry about the "cost-effective" use of public money. That would seem to apply particularly where nursery provision extends to three-year-olds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his letter of February 22, the Under-Secretary of State went on to say:
	<br><q><p>"the Secretary of State will take into account the detailed financial implications for the LEA…new nursery provision in self-governing schools will in some cases impose a new financial burden on the LEA. In such cases, the Secretary of State will normally only approve an increase in places or new provision where the school is able and prepared to fund such an expansion from within its existing budget, or where the LEA has agreed the basis for funding. However, when the self-governing school can show that the LEA, at the relevant time, is also expanding nursery education in schools for which it retains responsibility, and the school concerned might have expected to share in this expansion, consideration will be given to funding new grant-maintained provision on the same basis through AMG."</p></q>
That is perfectly fair, whatever I may feel about grant-maintained schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is somewhat ironic that I should move the amendment, because few schools in Wales will be affected. Ever willing to help to my hon. Friends in England, I am trying to save them from the manifest injustice and cost inefficiencies implied in clause 5, which the Under-Secretary so clearly recognised in his letter to the AMA. Given the strictures of his ministerial colleague, I hope that the Minister of State will see that, in terms of being cost-effective and planning places, nothing has changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The standard spending assessment—in Wales, the revenue support grant for local government—gives no discretion to LEAs to provide nursery places for three-year-olds. LEAs could be penalised by a clawback from their funds under the annual maintenance grant or the common funding formula procedure—unless the Minister says that the money will come entirely from a school's self-generated resources. I hope that even at this late stage the Minister will agree that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>266</span>
Department for Education and Employment was rather hasty in including that provision in the Bill. Our amendment would result in proper planning provision and fairness and justice for all three and four-year-olds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, certainly at this stage, because it strikes me that it would be at odds with the philosophy of the Bill to make such a concession for the compulsory sector of education. How much more odd would it be to make the concession for the non-compulsory pre-five element of education provision? It is rather odd that the hon. Gentleman should argue for bureaucratic procedures—or, safeguards, as he would characterise them—in an area of provision that we believe, within the limits set out in the Bill, are not necessarily in the compulsory sector. I say that particularly because of the introduction of the nursery vouchers regime, which has tried to bring a new dimension to pre-five provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman seemed to be most impressed with a letter, as indeed he should have been, from my hon. Friend the Under Secretary of State. The fact that is is from two years ago somewhat diminishes its validity for the purposes of our deliberations today. Since then, the nursery vouchers regime, with all that it carries with it, has been introduced. That is why I am not quite as impressed as I might normally be with a letter written by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tried to distinguish between three and four-year-olds, because the nursery voucher scheme makes a difference for four-year-olds. What if the nursery voucher provision costs the grant-maintained school more than £1,100? Where will they get the money? There is no provision for three-year-olds in the revenue support grant in Wales or in the standard spending assessment in England, so where will the money come from?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the local management of schools already makes provision, it will be replicated, or the Funding Agency for Schools will be able to provide the additional funds if it is deemed necessary. In that respect, I do not believe that the new regime will be radically different from the existing one. The hon. Gentleman thinks that he is on to something, but my best advice is that he is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this is complex territory, I undertake to write to the hon. Gentleman. Perhaps he will be kind enough to refer me to the letter that he has been quoting, and I shall write to him with that letter very much in mind, in order to bring out the distinction about what may have been then, what may be now and what will be when the Bill is enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to take up the point about consultation because there is a genuine misunderstanding. Paragraph 19 on page 27 of the White Paper, under the heading "Consultation" states:
	<br><q><p>"So regardless of whether statutory proposals are required, the Government will expect grant-maintained governing bodies to consult those who may be affected by the changes they propose, particularly parents and neighbouring schools, but also the FAS, relevant LEAs, the Churches (for voluntary schools)"—</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>267</span>
and it goes on to refer to post-16 provision. I have checked this and the hon. Gentleman will be relieved to know that these provisions apply just as much to pre-five provision as they will to the compulsory sector and post-16.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for pointing that out. However, it leaves me a little puzzled. What difference does the Minister envisage between the current statutory procedures for consultation and the consultation that will take place after the changes? How will they be different?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole point of the Bill is to try to strike a balance. Anyone who has had the privilege to deal with statutory proposals and bureaucracy, as I have, will know how difficult the process can be to handle, how lengthy it can be and what a burden it places on schools and other bodies. We shall remove as much of that as reasonably possible, allow an element of local decision-making and insist that a proper element of consultation continues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall oblige—although obligation will not be necessary in most cases—governing bodies to undertake a proper process of consultation. Let me stress, as I have done time and again, that it is in their interests to do so. It would be very odd if, as Opposition Members sometimes seek to suggest, schools were to go off blindly and expand here, change there or develop elsewhere without gaining any idea from their local communities, parents, other schools, feeder schools or whoever about what the implication of that might be. So consultation is in the interest of schools, but, just to make absolutely sure that it is undertaken, we have included appropriate measures in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, I am afraid that the Minister's words do not give me much confidence that anything significant and positive will happen. When we discussed selection, I cited a case from one of the old counties in Wales in which all secondary heads bar one did not want an element of selection to be introduced into their schools. The Minister said that, if consultation took place as proposed under the Bill, the one school that wanted selection could have it, so consultation is meaningless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a local education authority had sufficient nursery provision for all four-year-olds with a surplus to allow parental choice, and if a grant-maintained school in the same area said that it wanted to provide 30 more places but all the surrounding schools said that those places were not needed—they would be inefficient in cost terms—would the outcome of the consultation be upheld or would the school be given go ahead?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Consultation is not a referendum. We are not talking about a counting of heads or a voting mechanism. The hon. Gentleman's suggestion is beginning to sound like the Council of Ministers in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>268</span>
European Union, may the Lord preserve us. He will suggest qualified majority voting next, if we are not careful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked a serious question, and I shall give a serious answer. He has now given the game away. He has played his cards close to his chest, but we have now seen his full hand, and it is a pretty nasty flush. He is now openly saying that if an LEA is making sufficient provision—should I say monopoly provision?—no one else should dare to barge in, compete and offer alternative provision. Now we know what the Opposition are up to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also know why there is a difference of view between the two sides of the Committee. We believe in choice: if a grant-maintained school believes that it can offer something different or superior, it should be free to do so. For reasons that I well understand—the hon. Gentleman is hide-bound in his past, in his cultural roots and background—he sees monopoly LEA provision as being natural and the only way to provide education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knew that I was bound to respond to the load of prejudice that he spilled out. I ask him to recall the debate that we had on the nursery voucher scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, the Under-Secretary will remember the debate we had about the quality of provision and the study made by the Audit Commission in England and Her Majesty's inspectors in Wales that showed that nursery school provision in Wales was consistently excellent. If a local authority's provision is consistently excellent, what is the point of trying to undermine it by making other providers over-provide?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because a grant-maintained school may offer more excellent provision. The clause provides that a grant-maintained school would at least have the opportunity to persuade parents that its provision is one they wish to take up; if a school were not allowed to consult, it would not know if there were a demand for it, but we say that it would have to consult and so probably would know of such a demand. The school must make the judgement and if it commits part of its premises or funding, for example, to that endeavour and fails, we believe that it is still proper and desirable for it to make the attempt. Even when the local authority provision is superb, surely the hon. Gentleman would not deny—although I think he does—the right of parents to choose what provision they want?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can reassure the hon. Gentleman on consultation; we may, however regrettably, have to differ on the other points he raised. I rest on the principle that grant-maintained schools should be given the option of making alternative pre-five provision. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was rather disappointed by the Minister's conclusion, especially as he seemed to leave a chink in the door at the beginning by using the phrase

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot let the hon. Member for Wyre Forest get away with everything. I am sure that, like all members of the Committee, he will be interested in a brief debate on this string of amendments, because they come to the heart of consultation, which has been debated on a number of occasions in Committee. Sadly, we shall no doubt hear the same response from the Minister as we have had on a number of occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to draw the Committee's attention to the Minister's remarks in Committee a few minutes ago. While alleging that other hon. Members were giving the game away, he himself gave the game away. In respect of grant-maintained schools the Minister said only a few minutes ago: "The Government believe that if a grant-maintained school can offer something better or superior, it should be allowed to do so." The implication is that the Minister believes that, regardless of the views of other involved bodies and oganisations, the grant-maintained school that wishes to make a significant change of character should be allowed to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will tell us that there is a requirement on governing bodies to be involved in consultation. He will draw our attention to various parts of the clause. He will draw attention in particular to the requirement that grant-maintained schools in such circumstances will have regard to the guidance that will from time to time be offered by the Secretary of State. However, he may not so readily draw our attention to other parts of the clause, where, for example, we are told that grant-maintained schools will only have to
	<br><q><p>"carry out such consultation (if any) as appears to them to be appropriate."</p></q>
The Minister then might, but I suspect he may not, draw our attention to subsection (5), which states that
	<br><q><p>"the governing body shall, before implementing their proposals, give notice to";</p></q>
and the subsection lists various bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial difference between what the Minister will say and what these provisions, taken together, would do is that they require specific consultation and action to be taken in the light in the outcome of that consultation. The Minister has made it clear that he is not interested in the outcome of the consultation, but

that if the grant-maintained school believes that it can do something better, it should be allowed to get on and do it. It can consult if it wishes to. Indeed, the Secretary of State may even lay down regulations requiring it to do so in certain circumstances, if she chooses to do so, although we do not know what those circumstances will be, nor the details of the requirements. The amendments make clear both who the consultation should be with and the outcome of that consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seriously believe that under the new legislation there will be a significant number of changes in the character and size of grant-maintained schools and the range of facilities that they provide. They must believe that, or this financial year's education budget—despite the incredible strain being placed on local education authority schools, and although there has not been a significant increase in the number of grant-maintained schools—for the grant-maintained sector would not be set to rise by a staggering 14·1 per cent. Given that there is not to be a significant increase in the number of grant-maintained schools, one wonders why there should be that increase over and above the rate of inflation—an increase that is not being allowed to local education authority schools and local education authorities. The answer is clear. The statement makes it clear that the increase
	<br><q><p>"covers special purpose grants and includes provision to meet those costs which cannot be recouped from LEA's in respect of new grant-maintained nurseries, new grant-maintained sixth forms, new grant-maintained schools established by promoters, and changes in the point of entry for pupils to existing schools".</p></q>
I quote from the FAS bulletin No. 14, issued this month. In other words, the Government themselves are expecting a large number of changes in character to existing grant-maintained schools, and they have made the financial provision for that in this year's Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet, interestingly, those changes will be allowed to go ahead without any significant opportunity—with the exception of the minor interference that the Secretary of State may have been given by clause 12, to which the Minister no doubt will also refer—for the Secretary of State to object to them. In previous years when significant changes of character have been put forward by grant-maintained schools and others, they have had to take place under the existing statutory proposals, and in those circumstances on a number of occasions the Secretary of State—no doubt for good and sensible reasons—has rejected those proposals for significant change. If we allow clause 6 to go forward unamended, it will mean that the Secretary of State, with the minor exception covered by clause 12, will have no opportunity to do anything about proposals that even she does not believe are in the best interests of the local community and the schools in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reference to the White Paper, the Minister said that the Government will expect schools to consult. Yet we have heard no details of what will be in the guidance. We know that under certain circumstances schools will not be required to consult unless they believe it to be necessary:
	<br><q><p>"if it appears to them to be appropriate"</p></q>
That, frankly, is not good enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of my major concerns is the relaxation of the regulations governing the opening of new sixth forms by grant-maintained schools. At present, grant-maintained schools and local education authority schools must publish proposals to which the Further Education Funding Council can make a statutory objection, after which the Secretary of State's permission must be granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1995–96, the FEFC considered 66 proposals for the creation of new sixth forms. The FEFC opposed 55 of those 66 proposals and the most common reasons for objection were that there was no shortage of post-16 opportunities in the given area, that the proposal would not increase the curriculum choice of students, that the costs to the public purse could not, in the view of the Further Education Funding Council, be justified and that the proposed sixth form would be likely to affect the viability of existing provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the Government's proposals would increase unfettered competition—something near and dear to the Minister's heart. It would also inhibit any sensible planning of education for 16 to 19 year-olds. We believe that it would waste resources through an over-supply of provisions when severe cuts are being made in further education funding. We also believe something else near and dear to the Minister's heart: that instead of actually adding to choice, it would reduce choice because of the treat to the viability of courses provided by different providers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to cite to my hon. Friend something that is relevant to the amendment which happened recently in my constituency. Two colleges of further education, the Bridgend college and the Afan college in Port Talbot, have jointly provided courses in the town of Porthcawl. They have been working together—not competing against each other—and therefore making the provision very cost effective. Does he agree that this part of the Bill would undermine any efforts of that kind because of the predatory way in which some schools or colleges might act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That seems to be the view, not only of my hon. Friend and myself, but the implied view of the FEFC. Similar examples are noted in places such as Carlisle and Leeds, where there is a very effective partnership in providing those extra places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill would be to the advantage only of those proposals for new grant-maintained sixth forms, which currently, or in the not too distant past, have not met with the Secretary of State's approval. The Secretary of State is, in our view, simply giving up the power to make judgments on the merits of each case, and the Minister will explain why that is. I am sure he will repeat the mantra that he does not really care what happens so long as the opportunities are made available, regardless of the net cost to the wider community. If deregulation of the procedures is right today, then past judgments by the Secretary of State have been wrong to give a second bite of the cherry under the new proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>274</span>
The only argument for the measure in the White Paper is that current arrangements are "complex and time consuming". Again, that may be the Minister's view, but the procedures were deliberately designed—I should like him to try to refute this—to ensure impartial and fair assessment of new proposals which merit detailed examination. The White Paper also states:
	<br><q><p>"GM governing bodies will wish to ensure that their plans would add to local choice and diversity"—</p></q>
as I mentioned a moment ago—for post-16-year-olds and that provision can be sustained on the grounds of cost, quality and student numbers. Yet these are precisely the issues that must be the subject of consultation with the local community and the full range of stakeholders in post-16 education. We do not believe it can be left to individual institutions alone to decide what constitutes local choice and diversity or cost effectiveness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate on the previous clause, the Minister was talking about a Utopian world where we can leave everything to a single institution and the people who run it and hope that something comes out of the pot that is suitable for all. The Minister is not naive in these matters and he knows that there will be people staking a claim to their own piece of empire and the expansion of their own area of operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been examining the convergence of funding levels and methodologies for age 16 to 19 education—local management of schools for sixth forms, FEFC funding for sixth forms and further education colleges, and training and enterprise council funding of youth training and modern apprenticeships. This has been, to put it mildly, a hazardous and controversial exercise which initially looked like the prelude to another round of vouchers. I do not believe that is now the case. Certainly, the White Paper, to be published in December, will show that vouchers are not likely to figure directly, although non-cash learning credits—another piece of paper—will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me propose an alternative to the Minister. He is very fond of asking what we would do, and we have set out our proposals in "Lifelong Learning". We seek what we describe as
	<br><q><p>"a consensus on greater equity and consistency of funding for the 16–19+ education provision."</p></q>
The complexity of the issue requires a considered and consensual, rather than a dogmatic, approach. I know that goes against the Minister's nature and certainly the general approach of Government policy, but it is the only way in which we will match the needs of the community with the provision that ought to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Aside from our wider proposals on grant-maintained schools, our position is a simple one: unfettered competition in tertiary education inhibits sensible partnership and co-operative planning; it wastes resources through the duplication of courses and places; it undermines impartial careers advice to students; it threatens high costs for strategically vital provision; and it weakens democratic accountability of providers. We have proposed lifelong learning forums involving all the key stakeholders in tertiary education in co-operative determination of the broad
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>275</span>
thrust of provision. The forums would act as a means by which the worst effects of the competitive market place would be tackled and mitigated. The existing funding bodies, whether they be LEAs, the TECs or the FEFC, would remain but would strengthen collaboration. In addition, we would broaden and democratise the regional committees of the FEFC in order to promote regional partnership and co-ordination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting when an issue of this sort is taken on board according to the arrangements currently for county schools that, by nature of the relevant legislation, quite rightly, a number of organisations and individuals have to be taken into account. Westfield has to take a view about what the parents think, and it has done that. It took a view about what the feeder schools and the parents there think because there is a potential knock-on effect on the quality of education and the funding for education of the children who are coming up into the secondary school in the next year or two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that other schools in the local authority area are consulted, other schools with a sixth form and schools without a sixth form that might take a view in the future about whether they should have a sixth form if Westfield were to have one. We have a tertiary college system in Sheffield, and it is right that the college be consulted. It is right also that the funding council at tertiary level be consulted and the local education authority. They all have an interest in the Westfield decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should there be any misunderstanding, the school, the head, the governors and the parents have made it very clear that they do not want to go grant-maintained. If by chance however, the school had been grant-maintained, then under the Bill, it would not have been required to consult any other schools, or any of the parents of those schools, in deciding to set up a sixth form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impact of a school creating a sixth form anywhere in the country is no different whether that school is grant-maintained or a county school. This is what the Government do not seem to accept. They continue talking about grant-maintained schools and the benefits that they think schools obtain from becoming grant maintained, but they are now establishing a procedure to allow grant-maintained schools, to set up sixth forms that will not be available to county schools. The Minister should accept that the consequences of that action, whether it be taken by a grant-maintained school or a county school, are just the same for other schools in the area that are affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is trying to push through a clause that would not require a school setting up a sixth form to consult any of the other schools, the local education authority or the tertiary college that might be affected. The point was made initially by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, who is not in the Room at the moment, who said on Second Reading that he was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>276</span>
concerned about the implications if grant-maintained schools were free to set up sixth forms without any responsibility or necessity to consult other schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth is not in the Room, and I am sorry that he has not said in Committee that which he said on Second Reading. I hope that he will decide to vote according to the views which he expressed at an earlier stage of the Bill's consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends the Members for Bridgend and for Walton have a slightly different experience from mine with regard to FE colleges and the FEFC funding arrangements in so far as although my local college works very well and co-operatively with the secondary schools in the constituency, just over the border we have other colleges that obtain more of a print-out approach. They are passing chldren out of my constituency into their colleges because they know the numbers game is what it is all about. The more numbers they have, the more money they have, the more bureaucracy they can set up and the more managers they can maintain. Rather than expanded choice for young people it is contracted choice as courses in colleges shut down under financial pressure. It is a free-for-all. It is a market. The predator rules out there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is where I get somewhat confused, and I know that the Minister will explain it to me. In my town, we have six supermarkets—food providers—and a planning application for a seventh. People constantly come up to me and ask why we need a seventh supermarket since the six which are already there make adequate provision. I explain that it is because of competition and, after all, they are paying for it only indirectly. They are not paying for it directly. There is only a specific amount of money to go around and it is merely shifting it from one allocation to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can hon. Members imaging my having to tell them that they will have to pay directly, as taxpayers, to create extra places in one school which will in turn generate surplus places in another? They can see sense somehow with the provision in a free market. But when it comes to choosing tins of beans, another marketplace does not actually matter too much. They can go round and, believe it or not, they have got perfect information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role that we are going to create with our schools is like the role we have created for the further education colleges where the provider is not going to provide perfect information but is going to erect barriers to information. So we will have parents making decisions without that information. That is what I am concerned about. It is not the comprehensive approach, nor consultation. Nor is it trying to drive standards to the highest level at which we are looking. It is a dogma driven by some form of marketplace philosophy that equates a child's education with the purchase of a tin of beans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what we have at present. I should like an explanation as to how the rationale will work out so that we shall not be wasting very scarce resources in the creation of surplus places—particularly in the 16-plus

section. I am sure that there are many in my constituency who would also appreciate the Minister's explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Walton, sought to characterise the policies of the Government as competitive. I would characterise his as repetitive, because we have now had, in full-scale form, a repetition of most of the arguments that we have already heard under previous clauses. But I make no complaints about that because it gives me an opportunity to make the same speech again, which I am sure the Committee will welcome. On this occasion, however, I will deliver the abbreviated version because I am sure that that is what colleagues would wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had the same old arguments about consultation. May I repeat that if the hon. Gentleman would care to look at clause 6—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have done it all for the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman has not done it because he asked the question. Clause 6(3) says:
	<br><q><p>"In discharging their duty under subsection (2) the governing body shall have regard to any guidance given from time to time by the Secretary of State."</p></q>
The "shall have regard" provision is the overriding one and the guidance will be issued. Although I said earlier that I cannot describe to the Committee what the detailed content of the guidance will be, because we still have to consult on it, I can give the same clue to the content of that as I gave before. That is that if the members of the Committee looked at circular 23/94, paragraph 69, page 21, they would have a pretty good idea to whom the consultation would be required to cover. It includes the Further Education Funding Council, for example, as well as almost everybody else one could conceivably imagine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fears of Opposition Members about people somehow slithering around the requirements of consultation are unfounded. The answer to the question raised by several Opposition Members about how we can contemplate this dreaded free competition and market, as opposed to their much-preferred bureaucracy of planning, is that we do not believe that an LEA or even, dare I say it, the Department for Education and Employment, has a monopoly of wisdom in these matters. We do, however, suspect that local education institutions are knowledgeable about local needs, have consulted under the guidance given by the Secretary of State and are aware of the need to use available funds most wisely. They are just as likely—indeed, probably more so—to deliver something sensible and flexible in response to parents' needs as a distant bureaucrat in a county hall or, dare I say it, in Sanctuary buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have an almost pathetic belief that the planning process by infinitely wise officials, bureaucrats and even elected hon. Members is somehow superior to the wisdom of members of institutions that serve the community. I do not share that view. The difference between us surfaced yet again during our discussions on the amendments. I contend that the consultation point is covered fully by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>278</span>
combination of the provisions and my undertaking about the nature and content of the guidance to be issued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I equally contend that the difference between two sides of the Committee is honest and open. Opposition Members cling slavishly to their view that bureaucracy and planning are in all senses good and desirable; we believe in an element of decision making and dare I say it, in competition between local providers. It is for those reasons that I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As ever, that was a disappointing response from the Minister. Such a phrase has now become a cliché. It was disappointing not least because the Minister failed to deal with a crucial point in the amendments. They were not tabled merely to specify the nature of the consultation and with whom it would take place. They sought to have specified what should happen in the event of that consultation leading to real concerns about the proposals. If the Minister had read paragraph (b) of amendment No. 10, he would have seen what was being suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister now has a different view from the one that he held only a few months ago—that individual schools were as wise as anyone else when making decisions about their future, regardless of the impact that that may have on other schools in the area. He did not respond to my point that, under the existing arrangements, there have been many cases where the Secretary of State has received the details of the proposals that were consulted on but, in the light of that consultation, has decided to disallow those proposals. The right hon. Lady can make such judgments, but it seems that the Minister did not trust her when she did so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Walton cited a worrying example to do with the possible proliferation of sixth forms. I agree entirely with what he said. His concerns are widely shared in the sector. For example, I recently received a letter from the Association of Colleges, which made two important points. The letter stated:
	<br><q><p>"It is our view that a further uncontrolled proliferation of sixth forms is not in the interests of individual young people, and that it can only serve to destabilise existing patterns of 16–19 provision and result in wasteful duplication and competition."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They would say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Minister says. However, I am sure that he will explain to the Committee whether he is satisfied with the current competition with which the Association of Colleges is concerned. It has led to one in eight of our colleges now being in serious financial difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman is entitled to predict what I am about to say. Many of my friends say that I am utterly predictable but, occasionally, I am capable of surprising people—and now I shall surprise him by not giving him the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman however, for giving me the opportunity to say that it was not good enough for him—a sophisticated man of the world, if I may so describe him—to read to the Committee
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>279</span>
comments that I would describe, I hope not unfairly, as having a producer interest. They say that they do not like the idea of a new competitive element coming into their world and that they find it unsettling and rather difficult to handle. That is the usual response of people used to being planned for and controlled and not subject to competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now talking about an altogether different approach. I listened to what the hon. Gentleman said, but I am not surprised—nor, indeed, enormously impressed—that those most likely to be affected say that they do not particularly relish the prospect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may come as a surprise to the Minister—perhaps he has not followed the publications of that body and its predecessor bodies for the past three years—that it has been the most ardent supporter of Government policy. However, it is now beginning to see the real danger of taking competition to its ultimate extreme. Indeed, it states:
	<br><q><p>"The consequence can only be an intensification of competition between institutions, with further expenditure on marketing and promotion, at the expense of learning."</p></q>
An increasing number of colleges now spend in excess of £100,000 a year promoting their courses because they operate in such a competitive climate. Indeed, several courses for post-16 students have closed because of that competition, which is to the detriment of educational provision. That is because colleges are unable to achieve sensible strategic planning under existing legislation. The hon. Member for Walton suggested that the Bill would make strategic planning of the little that remains even more difficult to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the Minister said such nice things about me, I thought it only fair to respond in kind. Being such a sane and sensible person, never showing anger or displeasure, I am sure that he will forgive me entirely for quoting once more from that famous body, the Conservative Education Association. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I give the Minister such an opportunity to prepare himself, yet he disappoints the Committee once again by his reaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister would like to hear the views of the Conservative Education Association. For the pleasure of it, if for no other reason, I quote from the association's response to the White Paper:
	<br><q><p>"To allow grant-maintained schools to open up nursery classes or sixth forms, or to increase the number of places they have by 50 per cent., regardless of the number of pupils in the areas as a whole would be a tremendous waste of resources. We do not understand how the Government could continue to try and take surplus places out of the system in Local Education Authority schools while at the same time allowing grant-maintained schools to expand."</p></q>
That sums up our argument. There should be some sensible strategic planning; it cannot happen if the Minister has his way. As I said earlier, through clause 6 the Minister means to allow any grant-maintained
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>280</span>
school that believes that it can offer something better or superior to get on with it. We do not believe that that should happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 96, in page 7, line 16, at end insert
	<br><q><p>"and to any admission policy of the local education authority in whose area the school in respect of which the proposals are made is situated and to the number of places available in schools maintained by that local education authority.".</p></q>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that when any grant-maintained school proposes expansion it must have regard to the local education authority's admission policy and the overall number of school places in the area for which the LEA has statutory responsibility. I need not rehearse any of the specific arguments in favour of that, as they were advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Walton when we discussed the implications for sixth forms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concern is to ensure not that the so-called bureaucrats, central planners or local authority planners have sway over the process, but that the consultation to which the Minister often refers is real and effective and that the views of those consulted are taken into account. The Minister seems to say again and again that consultation is irrelevant if the GM school wants to go ahead with whatever proposals it has, so it is important that the amendment be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When there is any expansion, it is important that, the admission procedures are properly implemented, taking into account existing legislation on equal opportunities, ethnicity, gender and the socioeconomic make-up of the intake, so that no group is deliberately omitted or excluded from the expansion. I hope that the Minister will reassure us that the views of the LEA and other schools in the area will be taken into account in any consultation process and that proper regard is given to other legislation to ensure that there is no discrimination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the guidance on consultation. I suppose I will have to do that, however, because the speaking note that has, as ever, kindly been provided for me, states:
	<br><q><p>"Guidance will make it clear that both the LEA and local schools should be consulted, as at present. The LEA will have the opportunity to make any points it wishes, as will local schools."</p></q>
I feel safe in saying that, as it is in my official speaking note, so I guess that I am covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing guidance contained in circular 23/94 gives a long list, which includes LEAs, other schools—whether county, voluntary or grant maintained—in the area that may be affected by the proposals, parents and teachers in the area who may be affected by the proposals, and so on. I am sure that hon. Members know the circular by heart, so I do not need to say more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which consultation responses?

That is the second time that I have said that. It did not get as big a laugh this time as it did the previous time, so I guess that it is sinking in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no difference beween us here. We want the consultation process to be of substance and we want it to work; it is in the interest of schools for it to work. My preliminary view is that the responses will go to the school, but I suspect that other views might be canvased in the consultation. If the hon. Gentleman has a suggestion, we might even take it into consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister is being so open, will he say—I understand that he will want to consult about this—whether he believes that it will be appropriate for the result or a summary of the consultation to be sent to, for example, the LEA, the Funding Agency For Schools and the Secretary of State? Does he believe that a summary should be made available to the wider community if anyone asks for a copy of it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentelman is now trying to draw me rather further down the path than I would feel comfortable about going at the moment. I say that because summaries involve substantial, additional clerical work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bureaucracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>282</span>
summary to everyone and his uncle. I hesitate at this point because, if we were to require a school to produce a summary, we might place an additional burden on it which, on reflection, might not make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to draw a line rather carefully round the number of people to whom such information should be disseminated. Let me leave it at this: if the hon. Gentleman would be kind enough to give us his suggestions when we consult, we shall take them into consideration. The hon. Gentleman must allow me a certain amount of latitude, as I do not want to preempt or overburden the process at the time when we are trying to deregulate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A quick point: given the fact that the proposals involve consultation about expansion, which is often likely to mean investment in extra classrooms, will not the Funding Agency for Schools make the final decision on whether to approve capital expansion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that expansion will take place only if a school has its own money to build the necessary extra classroom space? Who will approve the expansion when the consultation has taken place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can envisage that the funding agency might deem certain cases to be appropriate. There might be cases where it does not do so, however, in which case a school will be required to fund any expansion from its own budget, through sponsorship or under a private finance initiative, or whatever. That is the thrust of what we are saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not hide bound or bogged down in agencies or other institutions. We welcome the possibility that institutions will consult, make their own judgments, decide what is appropriate and take the financial responsibility. If they can persuade the funding agency to fund their proposals, so be it. If not, they must depend on their own resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with the substance of the amendment. Perhaps I have said too much; members have drawn out rather more than I would have wished to say, but I shall stand by it in the hope that we can move on to other business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his response. Perhaps he has anticipated what I am about to say. Perhaps it is a little reckless, but I shall accept what the Minister has said about consultation. I believe that in most cases the Funding Agency for Schools will be involved and that there will be some rationality behind decisions. I beg leave to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. We have often heard in Committee arguments about the need to consult, based on the fact that the decisions of one school affect other schools in the neighbourhood. The amendments seek to ensure that schools have regard to any objections made during the consultation period by those who, under the clause, are informed of their decision. That is essential because no school is an island and every school must be aware of the effects of its decisions on other schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mrs. Cheryl Gillan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of my hon. Friends mentioned that an Opposition Member was looking a little flushed earlier, but that was perhaps because of the time of day and the heat in the Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be as brief as the hon. Member for Yardley was. As she knows, and as has been discussed at length, the first part of the clause provides for consultation on the proposals and for schools to consider the results of that consultation before deciding whether to proceed. Proposed subsection (5) provides an additional requirement to give notice to those named in the clause of an intention to discontinue provision of full-time education for pupils above compulsory school age, full-time or part-time education for pupils below compulsory school age or boarding provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 97 is extremely ambiguous. It could mean that those people who are given notice could prolong the period indefinitely. It would be confusing to have separate provision for objections from those who have been given formal notice of a change; it would not give the school any more information on which to base its decisions and it might prolong the uncertainty to no purpose. For those reasons it would also be inappropriate to require published responses from those given notice of a change, and I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>284</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not wish to pursue the amendments at this stage; I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 129, in page 8, line 8, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'and (d) every registered parent of every registered pupil at the school.'.</p></q>
The amendment is straightforward; it requires the governing body of a school to consult with parents when reaching a decision, a provision that the Government seem to have overlooked. They believe that they support parental choice—indeed, they have paraded it as one of the things of which they are most proud. Surely they will not allow schools, which parents have chosen, to make changes without informing those parents? Parents may choose particular schools for different reasons, but their reasons might well involve the availability of a sixth form, for example, and their choice might be affected by the changes that a school proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government propose that when the governing body has decided to proceed with any change, it must consult the funding authority and the LEA, which we believe to be right. Where applicable, the governing body must also consult the further education funding council. The Government believe strongly in parental choice, so I am sure that they intended that parents to be consulted, as the amendment suggests, so that the parent of every pupil registered at the school would at least be informed of the decision that had been made and would have the opportunity to express a view. The view that they come to might affect their choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister did not intend to allow grant-maintained schools to make the changes envisaged under the Bill without even informing parents. I am sure that that is an oversight and that he will agree to adopt the amendment, which is reasonable and absolutely consistent with parental choice. Parents should be informed about any change to the school that they have chosen, and I have no doubt that the Minister will explain that the measure proposed in the amendment was omitted simply by an oversight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause covers enlargement of the premises of the school, the introduction or ending of education for pupils outside compulsory school age, the introduction or variation of selection arrangements, and the introduction or ending of boarding. In some cases we agree that parents will need to be kept fully informed. Subsections (4) and (5) require that in such cases the governing body must give parents notice of their intention to implement the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some changes, however, will be so minor that they will not affect parents and children at the school, although bodies with planning responsibilities will need to be kept informed. If, for example, the school decides to select a few per cent. more or fewer of its pupils within the boundaries for which statutory proposals will not be required, that will have no effect
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>285</span>
on the current school population. Sending letters to parents about minor changes would be a waste of time for both schools and parents, and might cause some parents to pay less attention to significant communications from the school, while causing others to worry unnecessarily. We do not, therefore, regard an amendment requiring all parents to be notified of all changes as necessary or desirable, and I ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept what the Minister says. It may be that there will be minor changes which, from the governing body's point of view, do not affect a sufficient number of children at the school to warrant parents being notified, but that will not be so in every case. The Minister could have suggested that parents be consulted where appropriate, but at the moment there is no requirement for parents to be consulted at all. I think that that is wrong, so I press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
