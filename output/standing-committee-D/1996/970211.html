That the Committee has considered the draft Register of Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes Regulations 1997.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Occupational Pensions Schemes (Winding-Up) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 3126).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that I have been in Committee with you as Chairman, Mr. Thompson. I am sure that all members of the Committee agree that it is a pleasure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have before us two separate sets of regulations which form an important part of the Government's pension reforms. I shall begin with the Register of Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes Regulations. The background to the regulations is that the register of schemes was established in 1991. It registers schemes, operates the scheme tracing service and collects the pension schemes' levy. The tracing service is particularly important because many individuals with preserved pension rights tend not to focus on them until they approach retirement. Someone who loses contact with a former scheme can contact the Registrar of Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes and have the scheme traced through the register database.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Register of Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes Regulations 1990 govern the register's operation. They need to be amended to appoint the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority as the new registrar from April 1997 in place of the Occupational Pensions Board, which has been the registrar until now. We also need to amend the regulations because of the introduction of the general and compensation levies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, the register works extremely well, so while we have carried forward most of the original provisions, we have also taken this opportunity to simplify the registration process. We are extending from six months to 12 months the time limit for reporting changes to the registrar. That will mean that schemes will be able to notify changes at the same time as they make their annual levy payments, which will help schemes and the registrar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
There are also minor changes to the items of information required for the register, including a new piece of information about the nature of scheme benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations change the requirements about disclosing information from the register. At the moment, those engaged in research are allowed unfettered access to the register database. That has raised concerns about confidentiality, particularly in relation to data protection legislation. In future, only the registrar's staff will have the right to inspect the register. We recognise that the register is unique as a source of information about schemes and there is growing demand for such information, so the registrar will be able to provide information from the register direct to any organisation or individual specifically for statistical analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as offering a free tracing service for scheme members, the registrar will continue to provide information free of charge to the pensions ombudsman and to trustees about their own schemes. The register will also be an important source of information to assist people in fulfilling their obligations under the Pensions Act 1995. That is why we have extended the provision so that information can go to the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority, the Pensions Compensation Board, insolvency practitioners and the official receiver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, a breach of the requirements to provide information to the registrar can result in a criminal sanction. A court can impose a fine up to level 3 on the standard scale, which means up to £3,000. As a result of the Pensions Act and these regulations, the maximum fine will now be level 5—up to £5,000. OPRA has the power to impose a medium-level penalty on anyone who uses register information to market a product or service. That carries a maximum civil penalty of £1,000 for an individual, or £10,000 for a corporate body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations have been subject to extensive consultation with practitioners and others who have an interest. We have addressed the concerns and comments received. The regulations proivde an efficient and sensible way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Occupational Pensions Schemes (Winding-Up) Regulations are introduced by the Pensions Act, which contains a new statutory priority rule that will apply when a salary-related pension scheme winds up. That was debated at length in both Houses during the passage of the Bill. To recap the main issues briefly, the extensive measures introduced in the Act are designed to promote the security of pension funds for all members. It must be right to protect all the members when a scheme winds up not fully funded. That is what the statutory priority rule is designed to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the concern, which was expressed when the Act was debated, that future increases to pensions would not have the same priority as they have now under scheme rules. But pensioners will still be well protected. Pensions in payment will be second only to additional voluntary contributions in the priority order. I have heard it argued that pensioners need more protection because they have no chance to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
rebuild their pension rights, but those close to retirement can find themselves in a similar position. They, too, need protection. Even those who are not so close to retirement must be treated fairly so that they know that their plans to build a reasonable income for retirement are secure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transitional priority order relates to schemes that start to wind up in the 10 years from 6 April 1997 and meets a promise that was made when the Act was before Parliament. That will give high priority for pensions already in payment, including indexation, and to accrued rights for contracted-out benefits, including guaranteed minimum pensions. There will be no sudden change in the position of pensioners or those with substantial guaranteed minimum pension rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That links directly to the transitional introduction of the minimum funding requirement. A scheme that is fully funded under the MFR should have sufficient funds to cover pensions already in payment, including future indexation. Non-pensioner members should also get their fair share of the fund. Until the MFR comes fully into effect, there is obviously a greater risk that a scheme will wind up unable to meet all of its liabilities. That is why we have provided that transitional arrangement for the priority order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Liz Lynne 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rochdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the Minister would tell the Committee what consultation he has carried out. The explanatory note on the winding-up regulations states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State has consulted such persons as he considers appropriate."</p></blockquote>
Which pensions organisations have the Government consulted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The procedure has been the same with each set of regulations that has come forward under the Pensions Act 1995. An outline of the regulations, but not the detailed drafting, has been sent to the entire industry—every organisation from the joint working group to the National Association of Pension Funds—and I am sure that my officials could supply a full list. A wide-ranging consultation also included individuals who expressed an interest, pressure groups and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the outline was considered and we took the comments back, we produced draft regulations, sent them round the same group of people—the industry—and took their comments on board and made changes as appropriate. The consultation was wide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Lynne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been told that BT pensioners were not sent the regulations. Does the Minister know whether that is the case? Are there other pensions organisations which have not been provided with them? I have talked to solicitors and they think that this matter could be a minefield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree that it is a minefield, although it has inherent complexity, as the hon. Lady and others will have realised. I keep in regular contact with the BT pensioners—I met them last year—and do not recall them raising that issue. The list of consultees includes, for example, the Confederation of Occupational
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
Pensioners Associations, the Confederation of British Industry and other groups which have an interest in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The list is long, and I am happy to let the hon. Lady read it. It also includes the Association of Pension Lawyers, which is well known to the lawyers in this field, and the Association of Pensioner Trustees, which includes many scheme board members. In fact, the list includes everyone we could think of who might be interested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall tackle some of the other issues which are covered in the regulations, which deal also with several technical problems. They identify when a scheme begins to wind up for the purpose of the regulations. That is an important technical issue, which concerns the date of crystallisation of the liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations cover the position of pensions in payment that were secured by insurance policies before 6 April 1997 and where surrendering the policies would reduce the value of the pensions—cases in which there is no money over and above the liability that is secured. In such cases, all the pension in payment will take first priority in the list after additional voluntary contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations require the method of valuing pension rights to be in line with the minimum funding requirement valuation method and actuarial guidance. Importantly, they allow a lesser or greater amount to be used to secure pensions in payment so that the current cost of annuities can be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process of winding up a pension scheme can be complicated and lengthy, which is why the regulations provide clarity about where members come in the priority order at the beginning of the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations also cover technical issues about the discharge of liabilities. They limit the trustees' ability to defer wind-up and deal with the complications that can arise in multi-employer and hybrid schemes. All the provisions concern the nitty gritty, but also the real problems of handling a wind-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are important. Without them we would have confusion or stalemate, neither of which would be in the interests of scheme members—pensioners and non-pensioners alike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people complain that the regulations under the Act are over-prescriptive, but we have tried in all of them to pick up the real problems that the experts have raised with us in consultation. The regulations are a positive reaction to requests from thoses who have to deal with pension scheme wind-ups for us to clarify in legislation how problems should be dealt with. The registry regulations have been prepared in extensive consultation with those who use the registry, and the same is true of the winding-up provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will recognise how important the regulations are in the overall scheme of things. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
	<p>4.42 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Denham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southampton, Itchen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his introduction to the two statutory instruments. I shall deal first with the winding-up regulations because they raise the greatest number of substantive issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concern is clearly that the regulations could significantly disadvantage existing pensioners of occupational pension schemes or people who may soon retire and become pensioner members of such schemes. There is a contradiction at the heart of the regulations between the implementation of sections 73 and 67 of the Pensions Act 1995. Section 67 makes the intention of the House at that time perfectly clear: once a member has approved a right under a pension scheme it cannot be taken away without his consent. Under the regulations, however, someone who pays into an occupational pension scheme in the expectation—indeed, according to the way in which the scheme is drawn up, with the guarantee—that he will receive limited price indexation when he retires could, in circumstances that I shall outline in a moment, lose the right to that indexation, even though he has paid in for it and it is part of the scheme's basis. Effectively, rights that people have built up in the scheme are being retrospectively removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the purposes of our discussion, the main change that will take place is that guaranteed increases in pensions in payment will have lower priority than pensions that are not in payment. If a scheme fails because of under-provision, the remaining assets will have to be distributed around the different categories of beneficiaries of the scheme. The payment of pension increases to existing pensioners will come right at the end of the queue and people will be least likely to receive that part of their pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the extreme, for example, the regulations could mean that a higher priority woud be attached to returning the contributions of a 20 or 21-year-old person who had paid into an occupational pension scheme for only a couple of years than to the payment of increases to people who had retired already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations would also mean that, under what could be called the legislation's cascade principle, as soon as a priority was left unfulfilled all the money would be shared proportionately over a scheme's different claimants. Also, if there were any money to pay increases, the increases to pensioners would be only in proportion to the increases to those who had not yet retired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to return today to the debates over the 1995 Act. I would rather examine the effect of the regulations, but I recall the comment of my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) when the 1995 Act was in its Committee state. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"By putting pensioners' increases at the bottom of the list of priorities, we are saying that they are much less important than those of deferred benefits members."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
A little later in that debate, my hon. Friend made another important point:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government must ensure that individual scheme members are aware of the consequences of the changes to wind-up. People might otherwise budget for their retirement but fail to take into account the fact that their pension might be frozen".—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 8 June 1995; c. 507–9.]</p></blockquote>
That is important. It is posssible that younger members of pension schemes who become aware of the impact of the Pensions Act 1995 and of these regulations will be able to make extra provision—if they have the right information and are sufficiently prudent. They might use additional voluntary contributions, which are the most protected category under the Act, to safeguard against the loss of indexation if their schemes fail. However, people who have retired already will not be able to adjust their planning for the future. For them, loss of pension increase could be serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke earlier about consultations, and he will acknowledge that anxiety about the regulations is widespread. That unease has been expressed strongly by the National Association of Pension Funds, which represents the great majority of occupational pension schemes. That association has said that the regulations are likely to deprive a number of current pensioners and their widows when they are very elderly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the regulations come fully into force in 2007, there will be many people with pensions in payment who are in their 70s, 80s and 90s. As time goes on, they are less likely to be original memebers of the scheme than those members' widows. Those widows will probably receive reduced payments from the scheme and they will suffer even more if they lose indexation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That forecast has been made by the National Association of Pension Funds and by the United Kingdom pension scheme operated by Guinness, the GUD pension trust. The trust has some 18,000 pensioners—10,000 deferred members and 7,000 active members—and has also expressed fears about the retrospective loss of members' rights that have been paid for in the past both of those members and by the company.

What alternative proposals are available to tackle the problem of how the Act should be implemented? First, does the timetable have to be in place by 2007? It would be possible to protect the rights of existing pensioners by extending that timetable by 10 years. That would affect the way in which assets were distributed in schemes being wound up over that period of time but it would provide a longer period of protection for people whose pensions were already in payment and who are most at risk if their schemes fail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second possibility under section 73 of the 1995 Act seems to be that the regulations could make the Act apply only to new accruals. That would limit the pension rights of active members of the scheme only to accruals made from 1997 onwards. That would provide a much longer time before the full impact of the Act came into force. I hope that the Minister will provide a reasonable explanation of why those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
alternatives have not been taken into account, since the implications for existing pensions might be considerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider an example. Someone may have retired this year at the age of 57 on a pension of £8,000 a year, which might increase to £14,000 per annum by 2008 as a result of guaranteed cost of living increases. Let us assume that the pension scheme then winds up when the member is aged 69 and that insufficient funds are available to cover indexation. It is not difficult to show that, under those circumstances, by the time the member was 80 the pension would still be fixed at £14,000 per annum, but if inflation averaged 5 per cent., an indexed pension would have gone up to £24,000 per annum. In other words, under the regulations a member would be living at only 58 per cent. of his former standard of living, which would worsen as he grew older. That represents a very significant potential impact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise, as the Minister said, that we also have to take into account the position of those approaching retirement who have an interest in the distribution of assets of the scheme. Working on a new accruals basis would be an easy way of protecting such people, so the Government should consider that option more carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested earlier that there is nothing to worry about because schemes will be protected by the minimum funding requirement. I recall being told on a number of occasions when we were debating the Pensions Act that the Swan Hunter scheme, which had collapsed at that time, would have met the requirements of minimum funding. However, it was clearly unable to pay out the pensions that people had been expecting. Irrespective of that particular case, it is possible that the wind-up of a scheme could take place between the period when minimum funding requirement valuations had been carried out and the stock market fell, which could leave underfunded schemes that had apparently passed the minimum funding requirement test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The company behind the scheme might also have hit severe financial difficulties. The fact that the shortage of funds in the pension scheme was technically a liability on the company might have no meaning. There are real possibilities therefore that even when the minimum funding requirement is fully in place, a scheme might not in practice have the assets necessary to meet the indexation of pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be able to say more about why the alternative approaches to the regulations have been rejected and about why existing pensioners are having some of their accrued rights removed by the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me turn briefly to the Register of Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes, which marks not the coming of age but the formal birth of OPRA as the pension regulator. Will the Minister deal with the position of schemes that are not yet registered with, or regulated by, OPRA but will be from 1 April. Anxieties are being expressed about the conduct of ballots for member-nominated trustees. Complainants are being
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
told that they should refer their complaints to OPRA, but OPRA is saying that, as it is not yet in existence, it cannot handle the complaints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had drawn to my attention issues about the information provided in the recent GEC ballot, issues concerned with the company Thomas Broadbent and Sons and issues connected with Fullwood and Bland pension schemes. In each case, concerns were raised about information provided to members or the conduct of the ballot. There seems to be no body yet in existence to which members of those schemes who believe that the ballot has been conducted wrongly can take their complaints. I should be grateful if the Minister would tell us, on the record, to whom he thinks they should be able to take their complaints and what they ought to be able to do about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.55 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clapham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I should like to refer to regulation 3 of the Register of Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes Regulations 1997, which sets out the information that will be contained in the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, the register came into being in 1991, but, since then, there have been several significant changes—the number of pension schemes has changed, for example. Money purchase schemes have increased significantly and no longer provide a guaranteed minimum pension. Other changes relate to privatisation. In many instances, the pension schemes that were run for employees of certain industries prior to privatisation have now been wound up; they no longer continue for members who still work in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pension schemes of the National Union of Mineworkers and of salaried staff in the coal industry were both wound up and, although they provide benefit for the people who made contributions to them, those who continue to work in the coal mining industry, either as salaried staff or as payroll staff, are in a different pension scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that under most pension schemes, the Goverment came to an arrangement whereby in order to guarantee the pension, they would have access to part of the surplus. They take surpluses from the two coal mining schemes to which I referred; as both schemes combined are worth more than £17 billion, we are talking about a considerable surplus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the register should say whether a scheme is one from whose surplus the Government take a payment. It ought also to say whether the scheme offers a guaranteed minimum pension. I note that regulation 3(2)(h) sets out three categories of benefits from schemes, including money purchase benefits, but it does not say whether money purchase benefit schemes provide a guaranteed minimum pension. I put it to the Minister that the register ought to give that information. If it was a salaried scheme—although there is no reference to a salaried scheme—clearly it should refer to a minimum guaranteed pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The register ought to contain such important information so that when someone applies for it, it is clear to him or her whether the scheme provides a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
guaranteed minimum pension and whether the Government guarantee that scheme's pension in order to take a cut from its surpluses. I should welcome the Minister's comments on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the anxieties that he expressed—he has also given examples in the House—about members of money purchase schemes who did not know that they did not have a guaranteed minimum pension ought to make us concerned about people understanding the effect of the winding-up regulations and make appropriate responses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clapham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, for that intervention. It prompts me to mention a constituent of mine. I have corresponded with the Minister on this case, involving a man in his late 50s who worked at a small steel works and who found out when he retired that his employer had moved from a salaried scheme to a money purchase scheme. Because my constituent was in his late 50s, he fell into a trap, whereby the benefits paid to him under the money purchase scheme were significantly less than the benefits that he would have received had he remained in a salaried scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That case clearly shows that there is a need for the sort of information to which I referred being contained in the register. I do not know whether the Minister has consulted on that matter. If so, he will no doubt tell the Committee, but I hope that he will consider the sort of information which I have requested should be contained in the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), I note that the National Association of Pension Funds has said that existing pensioners will be worse off because they will not receive increases, as they did previously when a pension scheme was wound up, because of the change in priority. The association has suggested that the wind-up period should be extended from 10 to 20 years. The 20-year period would cover the association's concerns about the matter. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether he has considered those concerns, which I understand have been expressed to him. Why has not that recommendation been accepted? If it were, it would ensure that nobody would lose out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.2 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Irene Adams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My main concerns are about the winding-up regulations. I wonder how seriously the Minister considered the alternative approaches suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham). I am thinking of pensioners who thought that they had guaranteed indexation but who, 10 or 20 years down the line, will find that that has been frozen and that they will have less of a pension in their later years than they thought they would. I am thinking, in particular, of pensioners who have a very small
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
industrial pension, which often just takes them out of income support. We all know of pensioners in that position from our surgeries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister considered what effect that will have on the social security budget at the time? Many pensioners will be brought into the income support band, when they would have stayed outwith it had their pensions remained index-linked. Some of the regulations will strike terror into the hearts of many pensioners who thought that they had taken care of their old age and would have just enough to get by for the rest of their lives. They will not find themselves hoping that they do not live too long, quite frankly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.3 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Wray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very concerned about the issue. I thought that, after the Maxwell affair, there would be some security in pension arrangements. It seems from reading the regulations that the final decision is taken by the employer. The Goode report recommendations were totally inadequate and a double-decker bus could have been driven through the loopholes. Regulators will be appointed, but I am worried that, until such time as trusts have the majority of the contributors to pensions, they will not be safe. Employers will be responsible for any shortfall, but only if the firm is solvent. If the firm is insolvent, the fund will be gone and the people who have been paying for years will suffer. That is total fraud. It is a total misuse and misdirection of funds. The Government do not seem to realise that that is how the Maxwells got away with it—they misused the funds. The regulations do not make pensions any more secure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had the Goode report suggested a federation of occupational pension schemes with each employer paying an annual sum into a federation fund, and as only about 1 per cent. of pension schemes fall by the wayside, not a great deal of money would be needed to save pensioners the embarrassment of being left penniless. I should have thought that the Government would consider that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are aware of the comments made today about the new priority order on winding up, but we must think of the position of all members when a scheme winds up. The prescribed valuation method means that pensions will be valued by reference to the rate of return on gilts. On wind up, therefore, more cash will be attributed for pensioner liabilities than if assets were distributed to all members in proportion to their accrued rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen suggested that it would be a retrospective reduction in rights; but it is not. The regulations do not change the rights that people already have. Those rights remain the same. What is important is the level of assets available to meet those rights. The priority order does not preclude the payment of indexation to pensioners; it ensures that funds are used first to secure basic pension rights for all members. Only then does it provide for indexation. We should remember that all members have rights, and that those rights should be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
It was said that, the regulations would give pension increases a lower priority and that there would be less protection, but the regulations deal with the transitional period, not the principal change imposed by the Act. Ten years is sufficient for the transition, but I shall say a little more about that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong to say that, under the transitional arrangements, increases are at the bottom of the list. They are not. The list for the transitional arrangements that we are debating today starts, as everyone agrees it should, with AVCs. It then lists pensions in payment and next protects the rights that the national insurance rebate has paid for—the basic core rights of individuals in the national insurance scheme who contracted out and who are now entitled to a guaranteed minimum pension. The new rights, which will be acquired after 1997, not those over and above those rights purchased by the rebates, are the very core. The list then deals with issues such as increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be right to say that that is not the right way to prioritise. Putting the most important rights at the head of the list reflects what happens now with the order of priorities in scheme rules. With the exception of increases, we are protecting first the rights that are most important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that, in practice, a young person who has been a member of a pension scheme perhaps for only a couple of years has a higher priority than the paying of pension increases to existing pensioners who may have paid into the scheme throughout their working lives knowing that the scheme offered some form of price indexation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is right that, under the transitional rules, guaranteed minimum pensions—or if it is under two years, the actual contributions that are made—are protected. However, they will have been made with the national insurance rebate, which reflects the national insurance contributions that everyone makes. I believe that the state, as part of its investment in the contributory principle, should protect those rights as a priority, which is what happens within the transitional arrangements. After the 10-year period ends, all accrued rights are given a higher prominence, but that is right because the MFR will, over a period of 10 years, provide much greater protection of the funds—the assets—of pensions schemes. In addition, at the end of the period, the new section 9(2)(b) rights will have been on stream for 10 years; those rights are all the rights that accrue under an occupational pension scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister keeps mentioning rights, but who has the final say regarding the setting up and winding up of schemes? The answer is the employers—the contributors do not have any rights in those regards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the winding up of the scheme, the power is with the trustees—as the hon. Gentleman will have seen in the regulations, which make that clear. The hon. Gentleman makes an important point—I should be happy for him to come back on it—in saying that employers set up the schemes. It is good that they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
do. One of the reasons why this country, unlike others, has 150,000 occupational pension schemes with billions of pounds invested in them is that employers have been prepared to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly that has been a great thing for employers and has enhanced pensions and so on, but there has been a problem with board room directors all sitting as trustees and spending the surpluses on taking their wives to the Canary Islands and so on. That sort of thing should have been stopped; only recently, since the scandal, has there been a larger number of contributors on trust boards, but employers still make up a majority of those who control the trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What happens to surpluses depends on the scheme rules, on the Occupational Pensions Board and on the modifications they are prepared to allow for schemes. I say to the hon. Gentleman that the Pensions Act 1995 and the reforms that were so lengthily debated last year are providing a solid measure of protection for individuals, particularly through the member-nominated trustee provisions, the minimum funding requirement and the establishment of the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for lichen repeated his point about younger people. Bearing in mind the fact that younger people make contributions that count substantially in terms of long-term investment return, if we want to promote funded provision, it is not right to draw the line so that young people are totally disadvantaged. I believe that the hon. Gentleman will, on mature reflection, agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman quoted from a debate, saying that the new regulations would put pensioner increases at the bottom of list, but, as I have already said, they do not. The transitional arrangements give protection to pensioners in payment, as a high priority, and to the core rights acquired as a result of national insurance contributions in the rebate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm what the position will be in 2008?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has only to read section 73(3) and the amendment in regualtion 3(3); it is all set out for him there, in the most detailed and precise way. I do not intend to read it out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I help?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have read it. There is an important point in regard to that which we could debate; the MFR is also being phased in over a period. The 10-year period is directly linked to that and we accepted the Goode committee recommendation that employers should have time to adapt to the new funding requirement. The five-year limit for ensuring that all underfunded schemes meet the MFR does not bite until 2002; that gives a further five years, so that the 10-year period under the provision is closely linked to the period for bringing in the MFR. It is right that there should be a transitional priority order during that period which gives greater emphasis to protecting the core rights that I have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
described, but it would be unacceptable to extend that period in relation to the MFR, because it is crucial to the security of pension scheme members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no good reason to break the link between MFR and the arrangements for priority order. Most schemes are well funded; the priority rules take effect only where a scheme is not. Some important protections that I have not yet mentioned are contained in the rules on deficiency on winding up, which provide that any deficit below the MFR is a debt on the employer, and in the compensation arrangements, which mean that in a case of fraud, 90 per cent. of the liabilities could be met. If all else fails and a scheme cannot meet its liabilities, it is necessary to have a fair priority order that meets the needs of the situation; that is what the regulations provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen asked, "Why not introduce ring-fencing?" Again, that would provide full protection for some members at the expense of others. Trustees should take account of the interests of all members and be wary of agreeing to arrangements that would prejudice the interests of some.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Swan Hunter was mentioned. The problem with that scheme was that there were insufficient funds to buy all non-pensioner members guaranteed insurance annuities; there was no problem for pensioner members. Under the minimum funding requirement, non-pensioners will get fair value for their rights for them to build on in another scheme or in a personal pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerning member-nominated trustees, ballots and OPRA—a matter raised by two Opposition Members—OPRA will have its full powers from 6 April. Anyone with a problem will then be able to go to OPRA and it will take up any question of a breach of the legislative requirements. I know that it is already happy to receive information and complaints about issues relating to member-nominated trustees or other issues. From April, OPRA will be able to ask for the procedures to be rerun if it is not satisfied that they have been performed properly. That has nothing much to do with the regulations, but that recourse will be available in the near future, and if people have a complaint, OPRA is happy to receive it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I pursue this point, because it is critical? Is the Minister confirming that, from April, OPRA will have the power to act on complaints about actions taken before it gained its full powers? In other words, if a ballot takes place today, can OPRA judge in April that it was not properly carried out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will remember, we wanted to introduce the member-nominated trustee regulations in October to give people the opportunity to get the new arrangements under way; I think that all parties agreed with that decision. Many of the procedures have stated since October, but OPRA can order procedures that were undertaken
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
after October to be rerun—I notice that officials are nodding vigorously as I say that, which proves that I am accurate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification, the Minister led the Committee to believe that OPRA has power; it has power only as an overseer. It can report back on complaints about anything that is inappropriate, but it has no powers concerning the winding up of a scheme. The employer has full powers concerning winding up. Regulators can take no action against an employer who winds up a scheme; the employer has the full power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving us his view of the regulations, but if he reads Regulation No. 2 of the draft Occupational Pension Schemes (Winding Up) Regulations 1996, he will see that one of the ways in which a scheme can be wound up is by the authority winding it up. So the regulatory authority has power to wind up schemes and to supervise how they are wound up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> The authority can wind up a scheme only if the employer agrees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> We can have an interesting debate about that at another time, but that is not strictly what we are discussing today. The hon. Gentleman suggested that the view of the National Association of Pension funds is that pensioners will be worse off; the hon. Member for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) said that they might be on income support. That is not correct. Risks arise only if a scheme is poorly funded. In that case, it is not fair that younger people should bear the loss—the bias would still be towards pensioners. The hon. Member for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) should consider the example of a 64-year-old man who is three or four months from retirement. Is it right that his accrued rights should be substantially diminished simply to pay an increase to a pensioner member who is six months older than he is? The regulations rightly seek to establish fairness between those two individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minimum funding requirement and the statement of investment principle, together with the other provisions to ensure that schemes are properly run and administered, the increased vigilance of trustees and the promotion of security for all members are safeguards that are part of the overall package. If a scheme is underfunded when it winds up, we believe that it is fairer to give protection to the basic pension rights of all members. The regulations are important because they allow progressive introduction of the statutory order set out in the Pensions Act 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the purpose of the register is to act as a go-between for the individual trustees and others so that individuals can trace their pension scheme—many people forget or lose their pension scheme. That is a useful function. There are other requirements to disclose information to members that are far more detailed and would meet the point made by the hon. Member for Itchen. The register is not for that purpose, but for the purposes set out in the regulations, which I commend to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.22 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly wrap up a few points, Mr. Thompson? The Minister challenged my contention that members are losing their accrued rights when schemes are wound up, but there are cases, such as the Guinness scheme that I mentioned, in which the existing trustee has a different order of priorities from that of the members. People were members of such schemes on the understanding that their indexation would receive a certain kind of priority if the scheme were wound up. The regulations now remove that possibility from members, which is a significant and retrospective change to their rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither the compensation for fraud nor, I suspect, the fact that underfunding may be a debt on an employer is likely to be relevant in most cases of winding-up. It is more likely that the company behind the scheme has collapsed and gone out of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The MFR has been mentioned several times. My hon. Friends and I prayed against the MFR regulations some months ago, but we have not yet had the chance to debate them—we expect to at some time. It is all very well giving hon. Members assurances that MFR will do this, that and the other, but we have not yet had the chance to scrutinise the regulations in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
Committee. I think that a number of issues will be raised then that will suggest that we should not put quite as much faith in MFR as the Minister suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the regulations are the best possible. Nobody would disagree about fairness, but we do not believe that the regulations achieve it, and they may need to be revisited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to you, Mr. Thompson, for bearing with us during our exchanges on OPRA's powers. Those exchanges did not have a great deal to do with the regulations, but this afternoon the Minister has made a statement that will be important to many people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
