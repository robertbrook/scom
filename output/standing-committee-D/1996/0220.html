<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0487">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
amendments for the convenience of our debate. It makes a lot of sense to do so.<br><br>
It might be helpful to the Committee if I set out the background to the amendment and those grouped with it. On Second Reading my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health announced that we should table amendments in Committee to ensure that only members of the NHS family would be able to hold contracts with health authorities for the provision of services under the Bill. The amendments deliver that commitment with regard to pilot schemes.<br><br>
Following discussions with the medical profession, I must give notice that we shall also table equivalent amendments relating to the more permanent arrangements that are established after the pilot schemes. That is a consequence of our policy. We shall also table further amendments in due course specifying who will be permitted to put forward proposals for pilot schemes.<br><br>
The key provisions are set out in new clause 19 in respect of pilot schemes involving personal medical services and in new clause 20 in respect of schemes involving personal dental services. The new clauses state clearly that agreements, or contracts, for such schemes may be held only by specified individuals or bodies. The conditions, which are tightly drafted, are listed in subsection (2) and further defined in subsection (3) of the new clauses.<br><br>
For the avoidance of doubt—although it is not strictly necessary to do so—we shall table additional amendments specifying that only those specified individuals or bodies and no others will be permitted to put forward proposals for pilot schemes. That will be done for the sake of neatness. It seems most unlikely that anyone who is not qualified to run a pilot scheme would bother to put together a proposal, but concerns about that matter have been expressed to us and we are glad to tidy up the matter.<br><br>
We devised the list in the new clauses of those who comprise the NHS family in such a way as to ensure that key groups who work in the NHS are included and to put beyond doubt the fact that commercial organisations are excluded. In addition to general practitioners, general dental practitioners and trusts, the list includes individuals who contribute to NHS services as employees of general medical or dental practices or of trusts.<br><br>
The new clauses will ensure that key healthcare professionals who are involved in the delivery of primary health care will be ale to put forward proposals and hold contracts. The most straightforward and talked-about example is practice nurses employed by GP practices. Other examples include community nurses employed by NHS trusts and practice managers who may want to put forward a proposal with a group of professionals or a group of GPs. The provisions also ensure that those people may form themselves into partnerships or companies, if that is convenient, as a vehicle for carrying out their duties and providing services under the Bill.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
I assure the Committee that we have been extremely careful in the drafting of the amendments and new clauses to rule out the possibility that anyone other than members of the NHS family may have an interest in such a company, be that a beneficial or technical interest. There is no way out of the circle that we have made round the NHS family.<br><br>
The principle that all professional groups encompassed by the definition of the NHS family should be treated equally by the Bill is fully respected in the amendments. Amendments Nos. 99, 100 and 101 do away with the provisions which until now have given a guaranteed right to GPs, general dental practitioners and trusts to have their proposals put forward, but not to others in the NHS family. That right has now been extended so that anyone who is qualified under the amended legislation before the Committee to put together a pilot scheme has the right to have that scheme assessed by the Secretary of State. That has been widely welcomed, particularly by the nursing profession and others who play such an important role in the delivery of primary health care.<br><br>
We shall consider on their merits all proposals that meet the criteria that we have set, regardless of the professional group from which they come. We shall, however, expect all proposals to show how they intend to secure the medical or dental involvement that all pilot schemes will need. For a pilot proposal to be credible, it is important that the partnership and the team that will provide the range of services encompassed in the pilot proposal are clearly set out.<br><br>
There has been concern about the possibility of commercialisation resulting from the Bill. That has always been an argument at the periphery of what the Bill is about. It was clear from the consultation exercises that preceded the White Papers, "Primary Care: Delivering the Future" and "Choice and Opportunity", that the mainstream of change that would take place in primary care would be provided by those who already provide it. Be that at the periphery or not, we have listened to those concerns about commercialisation and the amendments respond to those concerns. They bring back to the spotlight the purpose of the Bill—to provide opportunities for those who already deliver NHS primary care to do so in new and better ways. The amendments and new clauses have been discussed comprehensively with the General Medical Services Committee of the British Medical Association, which agrees that they are the most appropriate way of achieving our shared objectives. I welcome the fact that we now stand firmly on the same square as the General Medical Services Committee on the issue.<br><br>
We have also had discussions with the Royal College of Nursing. I had such a discussion about the framework and detail of the amendments last week and I am glad to tell the Committee that it recognises the opportunities presented by our approach and that there will be a more level playing field among healthcare professionals who provide primary care.<br><br>
Amendment No. 98 refers to NHS trust powers. It is our policy to enable NHS trusts to put forward
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0488">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
proposals and to provide services under pilots. There was some doubt about the vires of that in terms of the way trusts are constructed and the amendment puts beyond doubt their ability to do so. It also enables trusts to provide piloted services as members of a company, with other members of the NHS family—although, in the spirit of what I told the Committee earlier, not with anybody else. In effect, the company must be totally owned by the trust and the other members of the relevant NHS family.<br><br>
The Government amendments and new clauses meet completely the concerns that have been voiced in the public domain about the potential of commercialisation. Many such concerns have been vastly overdone. The issue was at the periphery of the debate about developments in primary care. I hope that the Committee can accept the amendments and new clauses as dealing comprehensively with any anxieties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Tessa Jowell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dulwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Sir Alan, for agreeing to take the Opposition amendments to the new clauses.<br><br>
I want to express our concerns about amendment No. 98, which would open the possibility for acute hospital trusts to employ general practitioners. We recognise that, in different parts of Britain, there are good and important initiatives: either general practitioners work in accident and emergency departments or other clinical specialties as clinical assistants, or a general practice is based in an accident and emergency department. At present, no general practitioner is employed under contract to hospital trusts. Our concern is that the amendment would dispense with the separation between the commissioning—or, in the Government's language, the purchasing—and the provision of health care, which would open the relationship to compromise. We are unhappy about that, but will listen eagerly to the Minister's justification for it.<br><br>
The meat of the debate and the difference in Government and Opposition opinion on the amendments and new clauses lie in the possibility created by the Bill for the commercialisation of primary care. The Minister is slightly disingenuous to suggest that the issue is at the periphery of the Bill—it sits absolutely at the heart of the Bill. To some extent, everything else has acted as a cover for what we know to be the Government's real intentions: to make it possible for Asda, UniChem, PPP Healthcare or other commercial pharmaceutical companies to become employers of general practitioners. They would become both the commissioners of pilots and the providers of services in the pilots.<br><br>
To demonstrate how unequivocal the Government feel about the issue—this is nothing but rank gossip—I understand that there might be a difference of opinion between the Secretary of State and the Minister on this issue. Perhaps the Minister is less persuaded, but the Secretary of State is absolutely convinced about the importance of commercialisation in primary care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me set the hon. Lady's mind at rest, lest she be anxious that there are divisions in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
Department on this issue—that is certainly not the case. The Secretary of State and I have made it absolutely certain that any possible loophole can be comprehensively closed, but we also understood that the debate could have got into the margins of absurdity—I do not accuse the hon. Lady of that. We reached the zenith during a debate on the Floor of the House when the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) suggested that arms dealers might set up primary care centres. That shows how absurd the argument had become. We needed to get rid of that peripheral absurdity, which was affecting the core of what was happening. My right hon. Friend and I agreed that we should remove it in the most comprehensive way, which is what our proposal aims to do.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given that the Minister has made it clear that he is at one with the Secretary of State, let me include him in everything that I am about to say about the right hon. Gentleman's views on commercialisation of primary care. The Minister may be relieved to know that we take no responsibility for the views expressed by the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey.<br><br>
I return to the interview that the Secretary of State gave to <i>Pulse</i> magazine when the White Paper was published. He commented:
<br><blockquote><p>"If it is a difficult area and a service cannot be provided using other routes, commercial enterprise may offer a solution. The main issue is whether it is an easily recognisable NHS service and it is better than the previous one provided".</p></blockquote>
I have been extremely scrupulous and generous in telling members of the Committee everything that he said rather than editing it to strengthen my point. We do not need to do any editing to strengthen the evidence for the enthusiasm—or, perhaps, previous enthusiasm—of the Secretary of State and, we now understand, the Minister, for commercialisation as a possible route.<br><br>
The Secretary of State introduced the White Paper "Choice and Opportunity" in the House last autumn. By opening up provision of primary care to the private sector, the Secretary of State sought to suggest that the provision of primary care by any other body was no different from provision under the independent contractor status that GPs have enjoyed since 1948. He may not have thought that there was a difference, but the BMA certainly did. At Committee stage in another place, the Under-Secretary of State, Baroness Cumberlege acknowledged that the Government:
<br><blockquote><p>"do not want to rule out any sensible opportunities, including a GP being employed by a commercial organisation"—[<i>Official Report,</i> House of Lords, 17 December 1996; Vol. 576, c. 1403.]</p></blockquote>
She was clear about the Government's intentions and I assume that she spoke with the full authority of her ministerial colleagues. After all, what is piloting for, if not to see how innovation works? She went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Indeed, it might be practically impossible to differentiate between, say, a group of GPs and other healthcare workers who form a limited company and a company already operating in the commercial sector with suitable experience of providing medical
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0489">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
or dental services. To differentiate in this way would be unjust and unfair."—[<i>Official Report,</i> House of Lords, 17 December 1996; Vol. 576, c. 1403.]</p></blockquote>
So, in introducing the Bill in another place in Committee, the Government's conviction was clear: they want commercial provision in primary care. Why are the Opposition so opposed to that idea?<br><br>
The first reason is that we believe that commercial companies operating as providers or procurers of primary care provide a threat to the basic principle of a publicly funded NHS, which is universal in its access. That view is shared by most GPs: when surveyed by a recent poll for <i>General Practitioner</i> magazine seven out of 10 were against commercial companies sponsoring their services.<br><br>
The second reason is that the presence of the commercial interest creates what was well described by the BMA as a third party in the consulting room. It threatens to come between patient and doctor as another potential source of influence and conflict of interest.<br><br>
For example, if I take my elderly mother to the doctor to see about treatment and bandaging of her leg ulcers, I do not want her to feel that the decision to prescribe a treatment is influenced by any consideration other than her clinical needs. I do not want her to be persuaded to use the products of the company that initiated the pilot that now provides her care. Nor does she want to feel that suggestions that she should go into a nursing home are motivated by the fact that the doctors who run the pilot have a nursing home and want to keep it full. Conflict of interest is inevitable when commercial factors are involved in primary care clinical judgments. It is unavoidable and works against the best interests of the patient.<br><br>
The third reason for our opposition, has not been properly aired. There is a struggle to maintain equity between patients in primary care. The risks of cherry-picking—accepting onto lists of pilot schemes those patients who are young and fit and whose healthcare costs are low—would be irresistible where profitability became a driving consideration. The evidence for that can be seen in the selective criteria applied, for instance, to the membership of some health maintenance organisations in the United States. We know that the Government do not accept those arguments and are intent, for the time being at least, on appeasing the BMA.<br><br>
The two new clauses before us this morning represent a clear retreat from the Government's earlier and what we believe to be their true position. It is not a retreat born out of conviction. They have introduced the redrafted new clauses only because the BMA threatened to campaign against them during and in the run-up to the election. The conviction that led to the inclusion of the earlier proposals in the White Paper has been wrapped up in expediency and simply kept out of sight for the time being. The truth is that, for all their fine words, the Government pose a profound threat to the founding principles of the NHS because they believe in the importance of commercialisation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
The parliamentary management of the Government's retreat has been bizarre. A raft of amendments were tabled to the Bill in another place just before Report. Half were withdrawn not to reappear, as had been intended, on Third Reading. Before Second Reading in the Commons, the Secretary of State said that the Government would be tabling an amendment in Committee to confine the pilots to the NHS family. That seems to have scotched the possibility of a BMA campaign for the time being, until the fine print of new clauses 15 and 16 was carefully scrutinised. Those new clauses were dropped and replaced with new clauses 19 and 20 after the BMA stated that new clauses 15 and 16 did not deliver the agreement reached with the Secretary of State to prevent commercialisation of general practice and to restrict primary care pilots to the NHS family. It appears that the decision to drop the new clauses came after a phone call last Sunday evening between Stephen Dorrell and the BMA's Dr. Ian Bogle. According to <i>The Independent</i> on Monday, the unsatisfactory nature of the amendments and their failure to match the Government's promise on Second Reading led the BMA to issue an ultimatum to Mr. Dorrell to the effect of, "Back down or face a GP-led anti-Government campaign during the run-up to the election."<br><br>
The problem stems from a disagreement between the BMA and the Government about the definition of the NHS family. It is important for the purposes of understanding exactly what the Government are up to that we tease out what has been going on. The BMA defined the NHS family as NHS trusts and their employees and GPs, dentists, the nurses who work with them and the staff who work with the nurses. It was worried that the definition of NHS employees and pilot scheme employees kept the door to commercialisation of general practice wide open. New clause 16 defined an NHS employee as an individual employed or engaged under a contract for services by an NHS trust, a medical practitioner or a medical practitioner who is providing personal medical services in accordance with a pilot scheme. The phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"or engaged under a contract for services"</p></blockquote>
also appeared in the definition of a pilot scheme employee. In effect, that means that any company working under a contract for services with the NHS could be regarded as a member of the NHS family. So, for example, companies such as Rentokil, BUPA and PPP Healthcare would all be NHS family members under that definition.<br><br>
So the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"or engaged under a contract for services"</p></blockquote>
has been dropped in the new clauses that we are considering today, which are otherwise the same as new clauses 15 and 16.<br><br>
We understand that the British Medical Association is now satisfied that the loopholes regarding the provision of personal medical services have been closed but it remains concerned that there is nothing in the Bill to prevent a private company from proposing a pilot scheme. The BMA still holds that the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
Government have not delivered on the commitments that they made on Second Reading, despite the fact that, last week, the Secretary of State claimed that there was no difference of opinion between the BMA and the Government. He said that he agreed that only NHS family members should propose a scheme, but was then careful not to promise an amendment to that effect.<br><br>
On Second Reading, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have, therefore, concluded that the best way to address the issue is to ensure that, on the face of the Bill, only members of the NHS family—that is: trusts, NHS dentists, GPs, nurses—should put forward proposals and hold the primary contract with a health authority…We shall therefore move an amendment in Committee to limit the primary contracts to contracts between the health authority and members of the NHS family."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 11 February 1997; Vol. 290, c.155–6.]</p></blockquote>
This morning, we hear from the Minister that a further amendment will be forthcoming, limiting the proposal of pilot projects to members of the NHS family.<br><br>
All that leaves us believing that the whole process has been conducted rather like a game of grandmother's footsteps and it does not create a climate of trust about the Government's intention in the new clauses. Indeed, it creates absolutely no confidence, despite the Minister's protestations and assurances this morning that it is not their intention to draft amendments using weasel words that will ensure that the possibility of commercialisation remains open.<br><br>
I want to put several questions to the Minister so that we may be clear about this. We know that UniChem said, in the light of recent developments,
<br><blockquote><p>"We have got to wait and see what happens in Parliament before we make any comment."</p></blockquote>
We know that Sinclair Montrose Healthcare, the company running the private GP service at Victoria station and which wants to become an NHS body under the Bill, has said that its plans would not change, even if an amendment were accepted. Kate Bleasdale, the chief executive of Sinclair Montrose Healthcare, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"the company would still aim to provide NHS GP services. But the GPs themselves might be self-employed. An amendment will not make any difference to our plans. We will still provide NHS services, and have GPs working from our premises and using our facilities around the country".</p></blockquote>
She added that the company would consider several different models.<br><br>
Will the Minister now write to Sinclair Montrose Healthcare and make it absolutely clear that the Bill makes no provision whatsoever for that company, as private general practitioners, either to propose or to take part in pilot schemes under the Bill? Similarly, will he write to BUPA and to PPP Healthcare, making it absolutely clear that there is no possibility for them to undertake pilot schemes under the Bill?<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
Many questions remain unanswered at this stage. The whole debate, founded on the clear conviction that commercialisation is the Government's intenion, has slid forward by neat drafting and the tabling of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
further new clauses and amendments to the Government's original plans. Nothing that the Government have done to date or that the Minister has said this morning reassures us. When I spoke to Dr. Ian Bogle last night, he made the point that the Minister repeated this morning: he is still awaiting a further amendment or new clause to make it clear that private companies will not be able to propose pilots.<br><br>
This is a chaotic and bizarre way to conduct parliamentary business. It is bizarre that letters attempting to placate the British Medical Association are biked round just in time for further amendments to be tabled. We have absolutely no confidence in the assurances given by the Minister this morning. We believe that they have no substance and are not intended to keep the national health service as a public service: they are a strategy to keep the BMA at bay until the general election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I did not wish to interrupt the hon. Lady in the middle of her speech, but I remind her gently that it is our practice not to refer to hon. Members by name, but by third person.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Alan. At the beginning of her speech the hon. Member for Dulwich (Ms Jowell) said that another hon. Member had been disingenuous. When I was first in the House, that was regarded as an unparliamentary term. Is it now acceptable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it falls strictly within the rules. It was a very qualified statement—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Said with a smile on my face.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is something that <i>Hansard</i> cannot record. We have heard enough about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add my concerns to those expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich. The Minister is two-timing the Committee—[HoN. MEMBERS: "Oh"] Hon. Members will find that I am completely right—the Minister said so himself. There are two Committees: this one, which officially does the business, and the General Medical Services Committee of the BMA. Amendments arrive in Committee and are withdrawn without satisfaction, so we come up with another set of amendments—why? Because the General Medical Services Committee of the BMA has said that the previous amendments were not sufficient to buy it off. I am not suggesting that the Minister is personally two-timing the Committee—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I just want to ask the hon. Gentleman whether he thinks that the amendments tabled by his hon. Friends bear no relationship to other amendments that I have seen drafted by the BMA, the Royal College of Nursing, the Consumers Association and other organisations which, quite rightly, take part in a number of debates in other forums of discussion outwith the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Shall we try to deal with the substance of the matter, rather than with too much hyperbole?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0491">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall soon deal with the substance of the matter, but I want, first, to reply to the Minister's intervention. In every Standing Committee on which I have served, I have been aware that organisations with an interest in a particular outcome have expressed their views to each side of the Committee. I certainly agree that such organisations have an influence over amendments. That is as one would expect. It might be better to have a Committee in which we listened to witnesses and responded directly to their comments and arguments. I agree that, given how Standing Committees work, organisations have an influence.<br><br>
This is an unusual Bill. In the other place the Government introduced 94 amendments and they have now tabled another set of amendments. It is extremely unusual for a set of amendments to be tabled and to be replaced by another set of amendments after discussion with the BMA committee, and then for us to be told that they are not quite right—we agree with that—and that additional amendments will be tabled on Report. We have been told in advance that the amendments before us are not the final answer because they have not satisfied another committee, which is making the decisions on what should be in the Bill.<br><br>
I share the concerns of the BMA committee. It wants to ensure that the Government rule out the possibility of commercial organisations taking a stake in pilot schemes to the extent that they are sponsors of the scheme and employers of the GPs and other professionals in the scheme. That is a legitimate concern because it would strike at the fundamental doctor-patient relationship which has been built up over the years. The way in which treatment is determined could be subject to the commercial concerns of such organisations. They may want GP surgeries to be held on their premises so that people are attracted to those premises for other purposes. Asda is keen that organisations with concessions on its premises attract people who will do their shopping at the same time. That may be convenient for people but is not the sort of activity that we would wish to associate with the national health service.<br><br>
It is reasonable to use the word disingenuous. The BMA is having difficulty persuading the Minister to find words that rule out commercial organisations, and it is disingenuous of the BMA to suggest that the Government would abide by that in any circumstances. I hope that the Minister will make it clear in his reply that the Government would abide by that if, to the misfortune of the British people, they were returned to office. Many of us suspect that, as with the privatisation of post offices, which was very unpopular and was dropped, the matter may be reintroduced if the Government were returned to power.<br><br>
I would like an assurance concerning commercialisation of the national health service. The Government believed that to be desirable at the time of the Queen's Speech and the Secretary of State was reported in <i>Pulse</i> on 25 January as having stated:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"If it is a difficult area and a service cannot be provided using other routes, commercial enterprise may offer a solution."</p></blockquote>
So only three weeks ago the Secretary of State had not ruled that out.<br><br>
With the repeated introduction of amendments to fine-tune the clause, it is difficult to believe that there is any sincerity in the Government's actions. It has been made clear that GPs would campaign against commercialisation and would make clear their stance in their surgeries and practices and to their patients if they thought that a private service was to be offered, or if a commercial service was to employ them. The process that we have gone through has revealed the Government's intention.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich said, and as I said on Second Reading, the rumours suggest that initially there was some distance between the Secretary of State and the Minister. On this occasion, the Minister's voice has been mellowed because he has been closest to the various committees that are the tail wagging the dog.<br><br>
I very much hope that we will be given a believable assurance that we will discuss provisions that make it completely impossible now and in the future for a commercial organisation to employ GPs and medical staff who are part of a pilot. The difficulty in arriving at the right wording does not convince us that the Government are sincere in these amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Tony Wright <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cannock and Burntwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will be brief, but it is impossible for those of us on the Opposition Benches not to try to savour this moment for a little longer.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich reminded the Committee, not long ago there was a time when the Government were clear about their intentions in this matter: there was to be a clear commercial dimension to the process. Indeed, the reactions of some Conservative members of the Committee suggest that they would still like that to be the case. There is no question that the Government have an agenda for the radical commercialisation for the health service. They are happy to proclaim that agenda in their freer moments. However, they also have a clinical difficulty. The health serevice is extremely popular and, therefore, a frontal attack is extremely difficult. It has not escaped the Government's intention that there is an impending general election nor that it would not be entirely helpful for them to have a campaign around the issue that we are discussing in the next few weeks. The prospect of Labour candidates across the land standing hand in hand with GPs on street corners, collecting petitions against the commercialisation of the GP service, is not one that fills Ministers with great delight. That is why we have had such a tortuous and embarrassing process where an agenda has had to be refined and substantially retreated upon to avoid that consequence.<br><br>
Nevertheless, the Government have an agenda for doing radical things to the NHS and, instead of doing them full frontally—which would create clinical difficulties—they do it through the back door. People
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0492">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
have rightly grown suspicious of the Government's intentions. They look all the time for thin ends of wedges, slippery slopes and back doors and they find them. They have found them in the Bill's provisions that relate to primary care. Primary care is an extremely expensive, non-cash-limited service. Conservative Members would welcome ways of finding a commercial point of entry into the service that would mean it could be carried out differently. Fortunately that is not going to happen because the professional bodies oppose it and because of the political environment in which we live. If that environment were to change, the agenda would reappear: how could it not?<br><br>
I should like briefly to remind the Committee about the proposal's general context. The Prime Minister has told us that his mission is to disengage the state from ever more public services. The Conservative party is awash with people who constantly tell us that they want to reduce the share of public spending in gross domestic product. They cannot fulfil their central mission unless they do radical things to public services. With the health service, their difficulty is that, because they cannot do them through the front door they must do them through the back door. That has been their approach to internal market reforms inside the NHS. They have now turned their attention to primary care.<br><br>
We do not have to be paranoid to spot strategies or points of entry that may lead to larger things. Through very small openings large things often climb. The public, press and Opposition are right to have drawn attention to the possibilities for a radical change in the nature of public provision of primary care contained in the Bill. In taking the Government up to the wire and in rejoicing in the gradual nature of the retreat, they are not only performing their function, but are being true to the health service.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley <span class='memberconstituency'>(York)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always important to read the small print and, when considering a Bill, spot what is not included. As the process of negotiation with the BMA and the tabling and retabling of amendments have progressed, I have become more convinced that the Government's real agenda is the privatisation and commercialisation of primary care. Each time they table a new amendment it is possible, without a great deal of work, to read the text and see the loopholes through which private operators will be able to provide primary care services. If the Government were determined to avoid that, surely on the second or third attempt they would have been able to get the parliamentary draftsmen to produce an amendment that would satisfy everyone. But that is not the case.<br><br>
I am convinced that new clause 19 will allow primary care services to be provided by commercial operators through pilot schemes and, later, permanent schemes. Subsection (2)(b) says that pilot schemes may be proposed by<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"a suitably experienced medical practitioner".</p></blockquote>
Elsewhere in the Bill, the words
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"who is included on a medical list"</p></blockquote>
are added to that phrase. But they are not added to this particular phrase so it could cover a medical practitioner working in private practice or running a business. Providing that a person is a qualified medical practitioner, he or she would be able to bid for a private project.<br><br>
Subsection (2)(e) opens the option of making an agreement for a pilot scheme to any pilot scheme employee who may or may not be a member of the NHS family. Paragraph (e) states that that opportunity will be available to<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"an individual who is providing personal medical services under that or another pilot scheme."</p></blockquote>
How does the Minister believe that the courts will determine the definition of an NHS employee? NHS employees are in many professions, not just the medical profession, and work part time in the NHS and in private practice. New clause 19 will provide NHS employees with the opportunity to use their status as an NHS employee to enter into an agreement to provide a pilot scheme on behalf of another organisation, which they own or for which they work, that is a private contractor of medical services.<br><br>
I shall give the Minister an example. Some physiotherapists employed by the York trust have established a private company—the Jorvik physiotherapy clinic. The NHS trust has permitted that private company to provide services in its physiotherapy department, using the department's facilities and equipment, out of hours, to private patients. That is a clear example of the privatisation of the NHS, which we have seen as the result of the Government's previous reforms, but those NHS employees, working out of hours, running a private service within an NHS hospital, using NHS facilities, would presumably be able to make a bid, as the Jorvik physiotherapy clinic—a private company—to provide primary care physiotherapy services for the patients of GPs who feel that their patients are not receiving a satisfactory physiotherapy service. They could use their status as NHS employees to do that. I see clear loopholes, which would allow the Government's original stated intention of the commercialisation of primary care to continue.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich referred to the statements of the Secretary of State in Pulse at the end of January, when he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"commercial enterprise may offer a solution"—</p></blockquote>
a solution to providing primary care services in areas in which they are at present deficient. That approach could still be adopted, even given the Government's third attempt to produce a measure—new clause 19—that they say will preclude that possibility.<br><br>
I am convinced that the Secretary of State is a cheetah; he is good at camouflage, but he cannot change his spots. His original intention was to allow the commercialisation of primary care services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Devlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And, of course, like a cheetah, he can outpace his prey.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, a cheetah is extremely fast at running and he needs to run extremely fast to keep
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0493">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
ahead of the people who can smell his scent—the people who can understand what his real intentions are. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I enjoy being heckled by the Minister, who is probably a great cat himself—perhaps a lion rather than a cheetah.<br><br>
The Secretary of State announced his intention—the commercialisation of primary care. He has been found out. The BMA is protesting. He keeps tabling new formulations and is trying to convince the BMA and Opposition Members that commercialisation is no longer on his agenda. Yet, when we examine the small print, we see that commercialisation will still be possible. If it is still possible and if we continue to have a Conservative Government, commercialisation will happen, as happened as a result of previous health reforms.<br><br>
In "Working for Patients", the Government said that the reforms had nothing to do with privatising the NHS. Yet, in practice, it has been different. I mentioned one private physiotherapy clinic in my constituency. We have also seen the privatisation of long-term care, which used to be provided by the NHS and is now provided commercially in private nursing homes, so that the public must pay. We see increasing sums of NHS money being spent on contracting in services from private suppliers. There is creeping privatisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Devlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's argument is that commercialisation per se is a bad thing. He does not recognise that long-term care for the elderly has, in fact, been improved beyond all measure by the changes that the Government have introduced. We no longer lock large numbers of old ladies into repulsive hospitals when they could be in nice nursing homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My initial response to the hon. Gentleman is to inform him that before I became a Member of Parliament I was involved in quite a lot of long-term care for the elderly. There is no clear evidence to support his suggestion that private care is good and public care is bad. My work, which was about the quality of care in different sectors, showed that in the private sector there were good and bad services, much variation and poor quality control. The services provided in the public sector were perhaps not as good as the best in the private sector but infinitely better than the worst in the private sector. The hon. Gentleman was wrong to generalise in the way that he did.<br><br>
I support innovation and improvements in services, and I agree that we do not want accommodation for long-term patients to involve a return to 24 or 30-bedded Nightingale wards. I take issue with the hon. Gentleman over his suggestion about privatisation. Previously, the NHS provided a service from the cradle to the grave. When people needed long-term nursing care they got it from the NHS in return for the national insurance contributions that they had made through their working life. As a result of the Government's changes, that is no longer the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
case. People have to pay privately for that service. Parts of the NHS have been privatised. I gave one or two other examples earlier.<br><br>
That makes Opposition Members, the public and the BMA suspicious of the Government's intentions. That is why we study the Government's proposals extremely carefully to see whether there are opportunities for further commercialisation or privatisation of NHS services. Those opportunities are still available. If a Conservative Government are in power after the next election experience tells us that those opportunities would be used.<br><br>
When health services move from the public sector to a public-private mix, the cost of providing care increases. Consider what happened during the 1980s to those countries—including Singapore, South Korea, the Philippines and Chile—that moved their health services into the market. The move was inflationary, it increased the cost of providing public health services and it reduced equity. Those with limited resources—they may be held by a GP or tied up in long-term nursing care which people have to pay for personally—and lower incomes cannot afford the same service, response time or quality of care that the better off receive. They are priced out of those services. That goes fundamentally against what the Labour party—new Labour—believes is the cardinal principle of a national health service: that it should be free at the point of use and available equally to all members of the public on the basis of their need for care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we leave animal analogies behind us, I should point out that one Conservative member of the Committee saw me running round the Serpentine last night. I was running into the teeth of an 80-mile-an-hour gale and no one would have confused me with a cheetah. I was probably more like a mangy grizzly bear trying to find a hole to die in after being wounded in the leg by a demented hunter.<br><br>
The Government are doing a deal with the BMA which they hope will stick. That deal is rather in the mould of the beer-and-sandwiches deals that previous Labour Governments are sometimes accused of having made with trade unions. Of course, one of the BMA's various functions is that of a trade union. It is important for us to consider that proposed deal this morning. My hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Bayley) has already raised the question of how the small print could be used in the nightmare case of a fifth successive Conservative Government. We are not too worried about the possibility of a fifth Conservative term, but we must face the possibility of the <i>News of the World</i> publishing a photograph of my right hon. Friend the leader of the Opposition eating a small baby for breakfast the day before the election and, therefore, persuading the British people to do what they would not have done on the strength of the argument. That is why we are concerned about the application of the provisions in the nightmare scenario of a fifth successive Conservative Government.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0494">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
11.30am<br><br>
There is, however, some agreement on both sides. There is also some agreement with a third party—the BMA—which has been conducting tortuous negotiations with the Government, causing clauses and new clauses to be withdrawn late in the day and replaced by others after the late-night phone calls and beer and sandwiches or, for the Secretary of State, given his family background, cider and sandwiches.<br><br>
The Committee must examine how the content of the clauses could be used. There is confusion. I have heard the Minister claim that there is not a whit of difference between him and the Secretary of State. I am trying to recall exactly when the Secretary of State was trying to get everyone to accept that the word "private" with respect to the NHS and its future evolution was not to be feared. I remember him hurling abuse at me for using my still small voice of conscience from a sedentary position during the Queen's Speech debate on health—it certainly was not on Second Reading. He said that all general practitioners are private contractors; and that we should not worry about the use of the word "private" and, by implication, the expansion of the private sector in the provision of primary health care. That raises the issue of how the Secretary of State sees the private sector and general practice.<br><br>
The Opposition tend to say that general practice is provided by independent contractors. I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Dr. Goodson-Wickes)—whom I believe is a GP although I am not sure whether he still practices in combination with being a Member of Parliament—knows whether general practitioners regard themselves as private or, as we would have it, independent contractors.<br><br>
The Secretary of State tried to persuade us, however, that as GPs are already private contractors, it should not matter if we accept pilot schemes that use the ingenuity of the private sector to expand the provision of general medical and dental practice.<br><br>
We know how independent contractors are able to be advocates for patients by acting in their purchaser role instead of their provider role and that, when they advocate a specific treatment for their patients they do it in an independently-minded way. That is how general practice has evolved in this country. However, because they are all independent contractors, we should not think that it matters little if they go the way that pharmacy went perhaps more than 80 years ago when Jessie Boot turned this country's pharmacy business from small independent contractors into a chain-store. As a qualified pharmacist, he would have found a pharmaceutical equivalent of the Bill many decades ago relevant to him. However, he managed to buy up all the other pharmacists and turn them into a huge chain. We are concerned about how the Bill's provisions, if applied by a sympathetic Government who wanted to do a deal with UniChem or with the pharmaceutical drug trade—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always interested in what the hon. Gentleman has to say. However, I shall try to move him away from that point by stressing that good
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
will in medical practice can not be sold—nor will it be after the Bill is enacted. That should answer his point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it does not. A sympathetic Government might decide that it would help to solve recruitment problems in hard-to-recruit areas if they did a deal in return for the organisation, ensuring that good surgeries were set up in areas where it is difficult to persuade doctors to set up surgeries and where they often do not set up the sort of surgeries that the Government want. Those might be multi-practice surgeries, but they are a possibility. I am not discussing arms dealer fantasies or direct private provision of services, but in hard-to-recruit areas there may be vacuums, so the sale of good will would not arise; nor would it arise in areas of new population. If such surgeries were run by medical practitioners, the other medical practitioners would become fundholders' fundholders. In one way or another, chains become established and we must find a method—I am sure that the BMA agrees—of excluding the chain-store approach to the provision of medical services.<br><br>
The Minister referred to direct acquisition by takeover of another medical practice, but I am discussing the filling of vacuums. That already occurs in the provision of locum services. I only know Healthcall, but there are other locum services. Healthcall is a private commercial organisation, but I believe that it is run by doctors—there is at least one qualified GP on its board who is a major beneficial shareholder. If universal locum coverage can be provided by a commercial organisation, how easy it would be for such an organisation to be slipped in as a provider of general practice of last resort in areas where it is not necessary to purchase an existing general practice and its good will. Healthcall could be used as a way of providing general practice in areas where it is difficult to recruit GPs, or where doctors find it impossible to retire because they cannot recruit another member of the practice in the standard way. It may be easier to bring in Healthcall to build a surgery. The Bill will open the door to that.<br><br>
Healthcall has moved in by the back door to the kitchen of the NHS with the provision of out-of-hours service. I am not blaming it for that because it was invited in and receives taxpayers' money to provide lovely, up-to-date surgeries, but only for use out of hours. How easy it would be to say to Healthcall, "You have a chain of out-of-hours surgeries and we gave you the money to build them as a free gift from taxpayers, but they are used only between 7 and 9 o'clock in the evening, so why not use them during the day as it is difficult to recruit doctors in the area?"<br><br>
Health care could be provided not by Dyno-Rod, Rentokil and so on, and certainly not by arms dealers, but by companies with a heavy general practice involvement and possibly beneficial ownership that have already received gifts from taxpayers to assist in the provision of out-of-hours services under the new contracts. They may have taxpayer-provided, new surgery provision in difficult areas such as inner cities
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0495">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
and the Welsh valleys where recruitment of doctors has been notoriously difficult since well before the inception of the national health service.<br><br>
It would be easy to decide not be curmudgeonly and irrational in fearing the word private or Dr Tesco or Dr Asda. Why not let Healthcall set up surgeries? They can balance their income and capital assets in the leafy suburbs where capital growth is assured with investment in hard-to-recruit, low capital growth areas such as inner London, downtown Newcastle, the Welsh valleys, and so on. We are concerned about those areas and the effect on them of the small print of the Bill.<br><br>
After long and exhausting negotiations and the salami tactics of introducing the amendments in the other place, withdrawing them and then introducing others in the Committee, the BMA is probably exhausted. The Minister and the Secretary of State have had a gutful in trying to find out how far they will have to go in excluding certain private sector options while trying to get the BMA to withdraw its threatened campaign against the Government at the forthcoming great democratic show. However, it is incumbent on the Committee to conduct a thorough explanation of whether those salami tactics, the cider and sandwiches and the late-night telephone calls have reassured us that we are not moving from the tradition of general practice, in place since the health service began, and moving towards managed health care or protocol-based limited primary health provision. We need assurances that we are moving towards innovative, as distinct from restrictive, health care which will be provided in the traditional way by independent contractors—that is, GPs with lists.<br><br>
We suspect that the Secretary of State would like to push more strongly towards private health care, which is why he has said that as general practice is already privately based, we should not worry about more private sector involvement. He believes that private sector skills are innovative and, as the Bill is about innovation and piloting, why not let the private sector participate? We believe those are the last thoughts in his mind before he drops off to sleep. It is only the strength of trade union opposition through the BMA, through our vigilance and through the Committee's debates that we are able to demand assurances of how watertight the guarantees—or alleged guarantees—are in new clause 19 on medicine and new clause 20 on dentistry. We need to nail down those assurances as strongly as possible either in Committee or at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a brief contribution. Conservative Members look aghast, but I remind the Committee that this is a United Kingdom Bill and there are specific concerns about privatisation in Scotland.<br><br>
Before I address those concerns, I want to focus on the main points made so well by my hon. Friends. First, I want to know what is meant by a pilot scheme employee. The ambiguity of the term provides an opportunity for an enormous loophole, and we have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
tabled an amendment to deal with that. Secondly, there are concerns that the term "NHS employee" may also create a loophole. My hon. Friend the Member for York referred to physiotherapists in York being employed by a private company. We know that that is a common occurrence in the NHS. For example, NHS employees of my local hospital in Edinburgh—the Western General—are employed by a company called MRI Associates. It has similar arrangements to those mentioned by my hon. Friend and uses NHS equipment and premises to carry out private work. I was recently at the centre of a further scandal involving two-tierism. Patients of GP fundholders in Edinburgh have access to the private MRI service within one to two weeks while patients of non-GP fundholders must wait the routine four or five months.<br><br>
I repeat the concerns voiced by my hon. Friends that the changes, notwithstanding their inadequacy, are part of a tactical withdrawal caused by the imminence of the general election. Perhaps we should be grateful for that. We were grateful last week that the Government backed down from a confrontation with the nurses and accepted nurse-led pilots. We should be grateful that there has been some tactical withdrawal to avoid confrontation with GPs during a general election campaign. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and others have made the Government's original intentions clear, I do not think that anyone is terribly reassured about their long-term intentions. If the unthinkable were to happen and they were re-elected, we can be sure that the original proposal to allow private companies to employ GPs would be back on the agenda.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
The parallel fear about privatisation was discussed on Monday in the Scottish Grand Committee, which met in Montrose, and it has been an enormous health news story in the Scottish media this week. I asked the Scottish Office Minister responsible for health the following very simple question:
<br><blockquote><p>"Will the Government categorically rule out, as a manifesto pledge, any PFI that involves the privatisation of clinical services?"</p></blockquote>
The Minister of State, Scottish Office, the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"No, I will not go as far as that."—[<i>Official Report,</i> Scottish Grand Committee, 17 February 1997; c. 10.]</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the right hon. and learned Gentleman is not quite so astute as his English colleagues, who know that bad news about health is not really what the Government want two months or so before a general election. Does the minister agree with his Scottish colleague, or is it once again a question of keeping quiet about true intentions before a general election? People in Scotland are seriously concerned about the privatisation of the health service in Scotland. The Government always say that we are scaremongering, but the evidence is clear in their proposals about GPs and the Scottish Office Minister responsible for health clearly stated that the privatisation of clinical services was on the Government's agenda. We—and, more

important, the people of this country—should be told.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will have clearly understood from Opposition speeches that this is the debate that has gone away. Some rather complex attempts have been made to reopen it, but it has gone away conclusively because the framing of the amendments and the new clauses make our intentions unequivocal.<br><br>
It may be helpful if I begin my brief remarks by reminding members of the Committee of the basis on which the Bill was founded. The Bill states the voluntary principle for all those who wish to provide the relevant services. We have had a debate about "what would happen if'. That is always a marvellous speculation, especially when the Lord Archer school of potential plots is pursued, as the hon. Member for Dulwich did with regard to primary care. That was followed by another what if argument about the most unlikely activity of those who currently provide services in the NHS primary care system. The hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) asked what would happen if those providers came together with a massive takeover scheme for the whole of the NHS primary care sector, and suggested that something similar had happened with Boots. We have answered that matter in the amendments and new clauses.<br><br>
I am sorry that the debate pursued by the hon. Member for Dulwich has gone away and that a consensus has been established about the way forward. Nothing that she may say will change that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A holding position is being biked round. The debate has not gone away. It would be helpful if the Minister assured us that no commercial organisation could propose a pilot, bid to run a pilot, run a pilot, inherit a pilot or bid to run a successor initiative after the pilot stage as if it were a member of the NHS family.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can answer that unequivocally. Under to the Bill, as it will be amended, no organisation will be able to climb into the NHS family. The hon. Lady's point about a proposal depends on further amendments, which, as I told the Committee, we will table in due course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what I call biked round.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady knows that when one discusses legislation and provides reassurances, it is not unknown for a Bill to be amended in Committee. There is nothing at all unusual about that.<br><br>
I am also conscious of the hon. 'Lady's earlier remark that nothing that I could say in Committee would persuade her of the Government's intentions. On that basis and given that I have been as emphatic as I can be in setting out the Government's true intentions, I will move on to the specific points raised by other Committee members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear that assurance, but does the Minister agree that there is a conflict with the wording of new clause 19?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dulwich expressed a concern about the separation of purchasers and providers. In whatever terms she chooses to express that, I am delighted that the Labour party is interested in the development of the internal market and is worried that it might be eroded by a provision in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make it absolutely clear that there is no incompatibility between our opposition to the commercial internal market and our support for a separation between the commissioning and the provision of health care. Eminent commentators such as Professor Chris Ham recognise that the internal market does not rest on a separation between commissioning and provision of care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I understand that point. I thought that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith), the shadow Secretary of State for Health, was somewhat pedantically trying to find a distinction to describe the internal market as something other than a purchaser-provider relationship. The distinction is absolutely meaningless.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dulwich asked whether there could be a conflict of interest, especially if GPs or other healthcare professionals were employed by trusts to provide services under part I of the Bill. Of course, the provisions in the legislation would relate to all trusts. We expect community trusts to be the most likely candidates in the first instance for combining with other healthcare professionals to put forward schemes for pilots—that is beyond dispute and has been the general thrust of the debate. In some circumstances, perhaps in areas that are served by combined trusts—community and acute trusts—those bodies would be able to introduce proposals.<br><br>
The conflict of interest argument advanced by the hon. Lady has, in essence, taken place in the public domain. To paraphrase: what if GPs, who are also commissioners, purchasers or fundholders—however we describe them they are those who have a say in what will happen about services in another sector, such as the acute sector or community trusts—are employed and there is a conflict of interest? Such matters would have to be resolved, but that must happen elsewhere. Were we to include an amendment such as the hon. Lady suggests, we would cut off entirely the possibility of trusts being able to employ other healthcare professionals to provide part I services. I am sure that that is not her intention.<br><br>
However, the hon. Lady's remarks give me an opportunity, which I welcome, to clarify the Government's attitude and to point out the criteria for the approval of pilots. Such criteria are beginning to be developed. The criteria include a proper assessment of the impact on existing services and service arrangements, including consistency with health authorities' work force plans. I hope that the hon. Lady will accept the assurance that there will be other ways of resolving conflicts of interest. Of course, it would be wrong if the development were seen as a closed shop that eroded the purchaser-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0497">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
provider principle. I am four square behind her on that point of principle, no matter how differently we choose to describe it, but I suggest that, rather than close down opportunities for innovative work in circumstances that it is impossible for the Committee to predict, it is better to develop mechanisms for dealing with the problem through the criteria for approval of pilot schemes.<br><br>
I shall give way to the hon. Lady if she wants to intervene—she does not, but she is raising her eyebrows. Perhaps, in the context of what she previously said, that indicates assent, but I am not sure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The sort of question that we should ask about conflicts of interest can best be put like this. Since we now commonly have—certainly in Wales—new GP-run, out-of-hours services, adjoining the casualty units of acute hospitals, what would stop acute trusts saying that they would like to employ doctors in such out-of-hours services, next door to the accident and emergency departments of acute trusts, on Friday and Saturday nights and busy periods during casualty, and get them to do the triage, so that they could whip through the waiting list and say, "All you need is a prescription, you can naff off home because there is nothing wrong with you, but you are seriously ill and must go straight to see a specialist"? They could get rid of about 70 per cent. of the people in casualty in about half an hour by a quick triage exercise of that sort. I can see that an acute NHS trust would find that attractive because it could reduce its work load by using GPs to dump problems back on to the primary care sector.<br><br>
Would the Government be worried about that sort of pilot because of a conflict of interest or would they welcome it because it would solve a serious problem in the management of late-night casualty loads?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman gives a thumbnail sketch, which would probably have to be developed for clinical purposes. He suggests something that is, in fact, already beginning to happen in accident and emergency units, minor injuries units and out-of-hours services. But the hon. Gentleman misses the essential point, which is for a pilot to provide part I services and, of course, he is forgetting that patients are entitled to be registered with the medical practitioner providing the part I service. The sort of model that the hon. Gentleman suggests would not square with that. Acute trusts do not require this legislation in order to develop that sort of model of care for accident and emergency departments. It is already happening throughout the country and has been welcomed by practitioners.<br><br>
If I may raise a Scottish point, I visited a service that is being set up in Glasgow, where innovative use is being made of out-of-hours funding and where GPs are providing an out-of-hours service. Indeed, one fracture clinic is used until 5 o'clock by employees of the acute trust and, thereafter, GPs provide an out-ofhours service and help out as necessary in the accident
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
and emergency department, where they perform triage and carry out the other activities that the hon. Member for Cardiff, West suggested. All that is happening already.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman suggests that part I services for patients would be decimated. They would not, because a comprehensive range of services must be provided. I say to him, as I said to the hon. Member for Dulwich, that the question will be dealt with directly in the criteria for approval that will be developed not only for pilot schemes but for the permanent arrangements that will be put in place, and one of those criteria will be proper overall assessment of the impact on existing services.<br><br>
Even if someone somewhere tried to use this legislation to being about the sort of model of care to which the hon. Gentleman referred, which would have an impact elsewhere, the criteria would strike it out as a model that could not be approved.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The issue is the conflict of interest. Does not the Minister understand the problem of allowing acute trusts to employ GPs? I used a broad example from my experience, but the interest of the acute trust is in reducing its work load, and it could ask the GPs that it employs to reduce its work load. That is the specific conflict of interest problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But the hon. Gentleman is forgetting that the GPs that are employed in that way will have a series of other obligations, such as the ethical treatment of patients and their professional obligations to treat properly. The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that GPs would summarily dismiss people who should have treatment in hospital and dump them elsewhere where they would not receive appropriate treatment. There are a number of fallbacks that underpin proper treatment, primarily the professional ethics of all those GPs or other professionals who provide health care in the acute sector or primary healthcare sector. I hope that we can reach some agreement on that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dulwich asked me to say whether I would write to a long list of companies, none of which has yet expressed the remotest interest to me in participating in the provision of primary care services. I do not intend to write to an exhaustive list of shadows standing on the periphery of the debate, but as the hon. Lady seems to think that those companies are following every word and nuance of the debate with care, I assume that they will read the <i>Hansard</i> report of the Committee's proceedings.<br><br>
I can confirm to her that the sort of model that she suggested would not fall within the terms of the Bill and, as amended, a commercial company would not even be able to put forward a proposal for consideration. Even if it were daft enough to waste a lot of money and submit a proposal anyway, on the off-chance that something may come of it, that proposal would be ruled out. In the privacy of their companies, they may prepare whatever proposals they like, but once I have tabled further amendments to the Bill, which I hope the Committee will accept, their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0498">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
proposals will not even be considered. I am glad that I seem to have satisfied the hon. Lady on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the Minister should make that clear, but just as we have said that he must satisfy the British Medical Association that it is not his intention to follow that course, does not he think it understandable that those who want to take that course will test out the legislation at the same time? I know that Asda, to which I referred on Second Reading, has not come back on the matter but I suspect that that is because it has connections with a certain prospective parliamentary candidate who, no doubt, understands that it would be unwise to speak about such matters at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before any companies waste money developing proposals that will not be considered or even reach the light of day when pilots are conducted, and if they are in any doubt about the legislation after reading the <i>Hansard</i> report of this morning's debate, I recommend that they write to me and I shall reply to them in the unequivocal terms in which I have spoken today.<br><br>
I was asked about the basis of the legislation on which pilots and schemes would eventually go forward. Of course the Bill is the basis on which pilots will be developed and implemented; it is wrong to suggest that other legislation will form that basis. I am sure that Committee members know that the relevant timetable has been made public and drawn to the attention of those who are interested in developing pilot proposals. We shall move forward quickly to develop the criteria for approval of pilots. People are keen to be involved.<br><br>
The hon. Member for York raised various concerns about who will be able to put forward proposals under the Bill's tight definitions. His points were, to be frank, somewhat bogus. I believe that he was primarily interested in new clause 19(2)(b), which refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"a suitably experienced medical practitioner".</p></blockquote>
As befits the spirit of Opposition Members, he immediately spotted plots where they do not exist. I must draw to his attention the definition in new clause 19 subsection (4), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this section, a medical practitioner is suitably experienced if he is suitably experienced for the purposes of section 9 of this Act, section 31 of the 1977 Act or section 21 of the 1978 Act."</p></blockquote>
That means that anyone who is suitably qualified can, in terms of part I arrangements, put forward a proposal in the same way as a qualified person, who may not, until that moment, have been a GP providing part II services, can do. There is nothing unusual about that.<br><br>
The implication of the hon. Gentleman's remarks was extremely restrictive. He suggested that people who had not provided part II services until that moment should never be candidates for the provision of part I services. In a sense, his suggestion is a reverse privatisation. I shall put the case to him in another way. He would have rejoiced if we had a system that provided part I services within NHS terms
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
that were so attractive to practitioners that they were encouraged to join it even if, until that moment, they had not wished to work in the public sector and had remained outside it. I hope that he appreciates that that argument applies to other practitioners who may not currently provide services within the context of the NHS, apart from at the employee point. I am not sure whether he has understood the new clause's provisions, which I believe are clear—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would a medical practitioner who is wholly employed in a private practice in Harley street be able to bid, and would a suitably qualified medical practitioner who works, for example, for a pharmaceutical company rather than for the NHS, be able to bid? I believe that the new clause would allow both of them to reach an agreement to provide a pilot scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point is false. His example was of a person who provided medical services elsewhere. Someone who was newly qualified might be in the same position—he, too, might wish to put forward a proposal in respect of part I services. I find it extraordinary that the hon. Gentleman should suggest that someone who could presently become a GP if he chose to do so should be excluded from putting forward a proposal in respect of part I services. That is not a logical point. It would be unfair and contradictory to suggest that that should happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must press the Minister further on that. I—and perhaps other Committee members—are beginning to understand the matter better as the Minister's explanation proceeds. It is one thing for a person who is suitably qualified to practice as a GP to go to the local health authority and to try to take over a partnership in a practice or to set up a practice. The Minister suggests that such a person could also, through the company with which he operates, provide medical services under contract.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, but I did not, perhaps, entirely understand the hon. Gentleman's point: no, that is not so. Such a person would have to operate as an individual contracting with the health authority which put forward a contract. Another corporate vehicle could not be involved with the company. To clarify the issue beyond doubt, if the hon. Gentleman examines how the redrafted new clause and amendments have been placed on the amendment paper, he will realise that even were it the case that such an individual came from a private organisation and wanted to enter into a contract in which, through some subterfuge, which is what it would have to be—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman listens, he will find out why. It would not be possible for the person to contract back in within the context of the company from which he had come. Hon. Members should realise that we have specifically excluded that possibility by stating that both the legal and the beneficial interests in any organisation that doctors
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0499">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
might choose to contract with must be held by the doctors themselves as individuals. Therefore, there cannot be a back-door route back in for a commercial organisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is becoming clearer, but I am not yet convinced that commercialisation cannot take place under the new clause as drafted.<br><br>
I have a further point: if the individual medical practitioner applied for, and was granted, a pilot scheme, the chances are that the provision of services would not be made by that practitioner alone—he would employ others to work with him to provide the primary care service. I think that that is implicit.<br><br>
For instance, a doctor working for a drug company that makes the vaccinations that are given to children could identify an inner-city area with a low immunisation level and say, "Here is a primary healthcare need that is not being met by the normal GP services. We want to put up a pilot project to provide immunisation to the children of immigrant families in the east end of London." One can envisage the manufacturer of such a vaccine doing that. It might have a valid health purpose and such a pilot scheme might be approved. But if the individual won approval for such a scheme, he would need to employ a number of nurses, vaccinators, contact tracers and other people. He might employ them by contracting in from his parent company—the company that employs him.<br><br>
In effect, a pharmaceutical company could use its medical director to make a clinically sensible proposal—I am not suggesting otherwise—and to introduce a commercial service: the service would be proposed for commercial reasons and be led by a qualified medical practitioner, but it would involve other people from the private sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for expressing his concerns so clearly. He makes an important point, which we must deal with and clear up. There are already methods under part II arrangements which enable general practitioners to delegate functions and enter into contracts with others for the supply of services. They are circumscribed by rules about conflict of interest and other such matters. It would be absurd to restrict the ability of general practitioners to make broad arrangements such as the hon. Gentleman discussed under part I arrangements. That is not the intention.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cannock and Burntwood (Dr. Wright) moved around so I cannot remember who made the point about the American model of health management organisations, but it was well made. I was asked whether we could contract back in a cosy relationship and about relationships with contractors. A concern need not be expressed only at the level of someone who had been in a previous relationship with an organisation. It would be distinctly possible that a cosy relationship, which we would strike at as not being in the interests of the health service, could be developed anew if it were allowed to be so by a general practitioner.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
We have issued strict guidance on the correct terms of engagement with pharmaceutical companies in providing such services. Anything not in the interests of patients or any apparent conflict is dealt with in NHS guidance. The matter would also be dealt with firmly under the criteria for approval that we are developing. To set all that in primary legislation would be to deny the flexibility in part I arrangements that is available in part II arrangements where there are controls to prevent the conflict mentioned by the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The crucial words used by the Minister were "in a previous relationship". He has admitted that a doctor who is qualified to practise in primary care and who works for a pharmaceutical company will be able to propose a pilot scheme which, if suitable, will be approved. Is he saying that a pilot scheme will not be approved if the medical practitioner who proposes the scheme continues to work part time for a commercial organisation? Will the medical practitioner have to commit himself wholly to the NHS or will he be able to work three days a week for a drug company and spend two days a week running his contractor supplier organisation? The qualifying body could be a company limited by shares with him as a beneficial shareholder. Could he work two days a week running his company providing services for the NHS and three days a week for a pharmaceutical company?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is entirely unrealistic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not unrealistic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I will tell him why it is unrealistic. A proposal for a pilot scheme under part I services requires a general practitioner to have a list of patients who need services. It may help the hon. Gentleman if I set out where we stand. The criteria require there to be proposed service benefits from the new arrangements. It would not be possible for someone to maintain a list and work part time by shoving off elsewhere rather than being a part-time GP as allowed under part II services.<br><br>
The second relevant criterion is the need for a proper assessment of the impact on existing services of new service arrangements, including the need for consistency with the health authority's work force plans. That is another way to deal with the problem raised by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The NHS and primary care services are experienced in resolving in the interests of the health service potential conflicts. I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is far from the intention of the Government to allow such conflict to develop in part I services when we are resolute in ensuring that they cannot develop in part II services. I hope he will accept that as a firm assurance which I am happy to put on the record while we go through the criteria for approval, both of pilot proposals and, after they have been evaluated, of permanent arrangements. I have heard his concerns
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0500">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
about potential difficulties and I shall certainly bear them in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister return to what he said in response to the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for York? He said that a medical practitioner, under new clause 19(2)(b) could not become a Trojan horse for the private sector because any commercial ownership that was not wholly, legally and beneficially by medical practitioners was excluded. I do not understand where that exclusion is stated. The exclusion is clear with reference to a "qualifying body"—in subsection (2)(d)—but it does not appear to cover the "suitably experienced medical practitioner" specified in subsection (2)(b). Will he clarify how the exclusion of any legal and beneficial interest applies to a "qualifying body", but not to new clause 19(2)(b)? As I am not a lawyer, I hesitate to tangle with the Minister's massive jurisprudential expertise, but I am puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the other cases to which the hon. Gentleman refers, an individual, not a qualifying body, would be involved.<br><br>
I shall read out the definition of "qualifying body" so that it becomes clear to the hon. Gentleman. It means:
<br><blockquote><p>"a company which is limited by shares all of which are legally and beneficially owned by persons falling within paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (e) of subsection (2).</p></blockquote>
If individuals who qualify for the purposes of a part I pilot choose to form a limited company, they become a qualifying body. The ownership of shares in that company, however, is clearly circumscribed. The new clause's aim was to make it explicit that, if people came together in that way, there could not be any subterranean movement in the ownership of the shares or the assets of that company. That is why the qualifying body has been so defined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the restriction of legal and beneficial ownership to those who are in the NHS family clearly applies to subsection (d)—"(a) qualifying body". That is in the Bill in cold print. However, when the Minister used that term five minutes ago in response to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for York, my hon. Friend had been talking about subsection (b) only. When the Minister used that exclusion clause—saying that all the shares had to be owned by, for example, the doctors—he was responding to a question about subsection (b), not subsection (d)—which refers to the qualifying body. Can the Minister clarify that point? After that I hope to make what will be my last intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The penultimate show from the hon. Gentleman. I am happy to answer his point.<br><br>
It is a matter of interpretation. If he examines the definition of a qualifying body, he will see that it refers back to those who might be part of it as:
<ol>
<li>an NHS trust;</li>
<li>a suitably experienced medical practitioner;</li>
<li>an NHS employee or a pilot scheme employee;…</li>
<li>an individual who is providing personal medical services under that or another pilot scheme.</li></ol>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
That is the definition of a qualifying body in new clause 19(2)(d). It is a catch-all solution to ensure that, if those individuals who are listed in (a), (b), (c), and (e) wish to form another partnership or, indeed, limited company to provide services, they become a qualifying body. If they do not, they cannot make the proposal. The Government's next challenge is to define in the tightest possible terms what that qualifying body would be. That is why in subsection (3) a qualifying body is defined as
<br><blockquote><p>"a company which is limited by shares all of which are legally and beneficially owned by persons falling within paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (e) of subsection (2)."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that if the hon. Gentleman takes that definition away and examines it he will agree that that is so. However, he wishes to intervene on another point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do indeed and I am not entirely satisfied about the first point.<br><br>
I think the Minister is now saying that under subsection (d), not only is there exclusion of commercial interests from outside the NHS family from medical practitioners who form themselves into a qualifying body, but that exclusion of commercial interests also refers to individual medical practitioners who have not formed a qualifying body. I am not sure that that is a reasonable interpretation, but I shall be happy if the Minister will write to me or if we can return to the matter later.<br><br>
I do not have Healthcall's Companies house details in front of me, but I believe that it was founded by a GP who still holds 51 per cent. of the shares. Healthcall may decide that to qualify for pilots, it will sell the 49 per cent. of shares that are owned by accountants, merchant banks or whatever and bring in GPs to buy up that 49 per cent. of shares. Hey presto, it will then be a qualifying body because all its shares will be legally and beneficially owned by GPs. Is that excluded under the Bill? Could people become a qualifying body by the device of selling beneficial shares that may now be owned by non-medical practitioners, accountants and so on outside the NHS family? Could people become a qualifying body by the device of selling non-doctor-held shares to doctors?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, because the total shareholding of any organisation must be held by individuals who come together to provide the service. I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's point. He seems to be suggesting that an organisation would have to be dissolved entirely and that those who previously had a part interest in it would have to come together as individuals to provide a new service. That is not an extraordinary proposition. If people wish to abandon old arrangements by which they provided services and come together in a way that qualifies under the Bill, surely the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that that should be prevented. Otherwise, people would be bound by the arrangements for the previous form of primary care and would not be allowed to move forward with brand new arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will write to the Minister to elicit further details of the Healthcare scenario.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0501">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I look forward with bated breath to receiving the hon. Gentleman's letter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister moves on, I want to remind him of a specific question. I asked whether an NHS employee who also ran a private healthcare company such as Jorvik physiotherapy clinic in York would be able to use its NHS status to enter an agreement on behalf of that private company. I believe that that would be permitted under the provision. That may not be the Minister's intention and the drafting may need further amendment.<br><br>
My final point—I shall then stop bobbing up and down—concerns an earlier intervention. The Minister said that it was plausible for my imaginery doctor who was employed by a drug company to be awarded a pilot scheme and contract other health workers from a private company. He said that they could do that now. New clause 19(2)(e) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"an individual who is providing personal medical services under"</p></blockquote>
a pilot scheme may himself bid for a pilot scheme. That person may be working for a private healthcare organisation on a commercial basis. Paragraph (c) refers to "pilot scheme employee", but paragraph (e) refers not to employee but to people "providing personal medical services"—presumably people who are contracted in who could, as the Minister admitted, be contracted in from a private healthcare company.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
But the contract would be held by them as individuals and if it became apparent that there was a conflict of interest in what they were doing, they would be struck out at that point.<br><br>
It is absurd of the hon. Member for York to suggest that we would exclude from entering into these proposals anyone who had an interest beyond what they did for the NHS. That could apply to a range of employees. For example, a nurse may be employed in a practice but, in her or his spare time, may work for an agency. A part-time general practitioner may do other work in his or her spare time.<br><br>
I advise the hon. Gentleman not to be too prescriptive about solutions, but to rely on the fact that the legislation that we are framing will set out clearly to exclude commercial participation in contracts between those who are part of the pilot proposal and the health authority. To suggest that those who contract under part I of the Bill should be placed in a different position to those who already contract satisfactorily with the health service under part II arrangements is to raise fears that do not exist.<br><br>
After an interesting and detailed debate, I hope that I have allayed the concerns raised by the Labour party, and I recommend the amendments and new clauses to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jowell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall touch briefly on some remaining points of importance. First, we welcome the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
Minister's assurance that no commercial organisation may propose, bid to run, run or inherit a pilot. However, matters of concern remain, as the exchanges of the past 20 minutes have made clear, to the Minister's discomfort under tight questioning.<br><br>
We are not reassured by the assertion that we should not be too prescriptive about exclusions. Everything in the background to the debate suggests that if we are not prescriptive, a door will be left ajar for commercial organisations to develop primary care, thereby destroying the integrity of the relationship between NHS doctors and their patients.<br><br>
We are not satisfied with the outcome of the exchanges during the latter part of the debate and shall return to those matters on Report. We have not yet seen all the Government's proposed amendments and I hope that the Minister will think it right to make other proposals in the light of our debate.<br><br>
One remaining question troubles hon. Members on this side of the Committee. Given the vehemence with which the Minister sought to reject any suggestion of commercialisation, why was it raised as a possibility in the first place? We are discussing every conceivable scenario in minute detail so that we can exclude the possibility of commercialisation. The Government opened that possiblity; it is now their job to shut that possibility down completely if we are to accept what they claim will happen.<br><br>
The way in which the negotiations have been conducted gives us no confidence that the Government want to exclude the possibility of commercialisation. The history of the national debate about part I of the Bill makes it impossible to trust those assurances. The problems are entirely of the Government's making. I assure the Minister and Conservative Members that we shall continue to pursue clarity. We shall try to ensure that all possible loopholes are closed.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments deal with the range and quality of services under pilot schemes and the related question of complaints procedures. I note that the Minister failed to tell us whether he agreed with the Minister of State, Scottish Office, the right hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) about the privatisation of clinical services under PFI. Is it that the Government cannot afford yet another major split within 24 hours? Or perhaps the Minister will not tell us until after the general election.<br><br>
The Opposition have frequently expressed concern about the fragmentation of the NHS under the internal market, which has meant that what one gets often depends on where one lives and whether the GP is a fundholder, rather than on what treatment is needed. Although I welcome many aspects of the Bill, we are worried that the defects of the present system could be exacerbated by deregulation—unless safeguards are written into the Bill to ensure minimum standards. Apart from anything else, minimum standards are essential to ensure equity among patients.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 34, 35, 63 and 64 relate to the provision of a full range of services. They seek to ensure that pilot schemes do not provide services that miss out some vital part of current general practice provision. We would, of course, welcome any services above and beyond current provision, but we are not prepared to allow existing provisions to be traded off under the new arrangements.<br><br>
I accept that the current debate about core services means that we are talking about a moving target. Nevertheless, under present arrangements certain services must be provided such as referral, prescribing when appropriate, health promotion and 24-hour emergency cover. We believe that those requirements should be written into the Bill as part of all pilot schemes. Similarly, patients wanting dental treatment should be treated by personal dental practitioners under the pilot schemes; it should be written into the Bill that they should have access to services at least
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
equivalent to those that would be provided by general dental practitioners.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 39, 40, 11, 71 and 72 relate to complaints procedures. Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 relate to complaints about the setting up of pilot schemes. Amendment No. 11 relates to complaints about the approval of pilot schemes. Amendments Nos. 71 and 72 relate to complaints under the regulation of permanent schemes.<br><br>
I note that amendment No. 40 would apply to pilot schemes, the conditions in clause 20 as to the qualifications and experience of personal medical and dental practitioners participating in pilot schemes that become permanent.<br><br>
The substance of the amendments relates to requirements for complaints procedures. It is important that persons who are treated by personal medical and dental practitioners have access to the same medical and dental complaints system as is currently in use. This matter was raised in another place. The Government agreed that the complaints procedure should be broadly the same, but spoke of minor modifications that might be appropriate. We should like to know what those might be. The right to redress is a key consumer principle which reinforces the fact that patients are entitled to a certain quality of service. The complaints procedure issue relates to the wider matters of quality that the amendments raise.<br><br>
The new complaints procedure has bedded down well. Broadly speaking, England has the same system as we have in Scotland, where practice managers, a designated GP partner and lay conciliators may be involved. I am not sure whether there are differences in the English system. I am informed that there are now broader grounds for complaint; a patient may now complain about a GP for alleged rudeness. The arrangements appear to work well, according to GPs and health council representatives to whom I have spoken. Few complaints are feeding through to the independent review stage, and even fewer to the ombudsman.<br><br>
It is important that under the new arrangements, patients should be aware that whoever their GP, the practice is involved in the same procedures. GPs have said to me that this must be made explicit in the Bill as we move beyond the current rules and regulations that frame the relationship between GPs and health boards. The public must be reassured about the complaints procedures. I fail to see how the Government can object to that being made clear in the Bill.<br><br>
Perhaps the most important amendment in the group is amendment No. 54, which provides that in conducting a review, the Secretary of State
<br><blockquote><p>"shall have regard to the quality of services provided."</p></blockquote>
It is central to our concern about the Bill that quality, not simply the cost, must be considered when pilot schemes are reviewed. Again, it is important that this be made mandatory. The minimum requirement would be that pilot schemes provide patients with at least the same quality as they currently receive from more traditional services. Even better quality would be desirable.<br><br>

Amendment No. 54 relates to the current debate about quality in the NHS which my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) flagged up in a major speech about quality two weeks ago. In almost all my hon. Friend's speeches nowadays—I say with modesty that I attempt to do the same in Scotland—he emphasises that we are attempting to drive the agenda forward. We state that although the health service has developed many indicators in terms of quantity, finished consultant episodes and other aspects, little attention has been paid to quality, which is what concerns the public—and patients even more.<br><br>
Debates about quality tend to concentrate on the hospital sector. I could, of course, concede that the Government have tried to deal with that in Scotland through clinical outcome indicators. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury has urged that that practice be extended more elaborately and effectively to England. Does the Minister intend to develop indicators for the primary care sector? That is what the Bill is about.<br><br>
The problem is already being dealt with by some people, and especially by nurses. That point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury in a recent speech. He gave the example of leg ulcers, the treatment for which is being pioneered by community nurses. He pointed out how evidence-based medicine had led to improvements in the treatment of leg ulcers, and that the improvements related to the number of bandages used. My hon. Friend's example shows that such work is going on, and we should pay tribute to the Royal College of Nursing and to nurses as a whole, who are carrying out evidence-based medicine without receiving the funding that general practitioners obtain.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
When evaluating pilot schemes, it is important that the quality provided should be considered. We should ask whether the pilot has led to service improvements, what outcomes have been achieved and what effect there has been on services in other areas. For example, we must consider whether there has been a knock-on effect on waiting lists in other relevant areas.<br><br>
We hope that the Bill will give an impetus to evidence-based practice, to the demonstration of outcomes, to peer group review and to the development of general benchmarking techniques. They are exciting aspects of medicine and should be extended to primary care. We have the opportunity to do that in this Bill.<br><br>
The Minister will no doubt tell us that committees have been set up. I know that one has been set up in Scotland, so I assume that one has been set up in England to deal with the evaluation of pilots. No doubt the committees will consider the quality of service. Those on the committee in Scotland tell me that they raise that issue at their first meeting. However, if the quality of service is being considered, it should be made clear in the Bill. If quality is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
implicit in the Bill, why is it not spelt out so that everyone can see that it is at the centre of the measure?<br><br>
We do not know what is in the Government's mind, but Opposition Members want quality to be at the centre of the Bill. The development of quality in the national health service is part of our health agenda for both primary and secondary care.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intend to comment only on amendment No. 54. The Bill sets out minimal requirements on the Secretary of State. Only the authority involved and those providing the service need know that a review is taking place, but no criteria are provided. Therefore, it is important for the quality of the service that the amendment is accepted.<br><br>
The Minister was given a good example yesterday. I am a member of the Public Service Select Committee and I was surprised to hear the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster announce a Government U-turn by saying that the Government had accepted the principle of consulting representatives of public service users, including bodies such as the Association of Community Health Councils of England and Wales. Such organisations will be consulted over the delivery of services. In fact, a joint programme is about to be launched with consumer groups, such as the National Consumer Council, to examine ways in which that consultation takes place.<br><br>
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster made the announcement in that Committee in response to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock and Burntwood and he accepted that the Labour party had come up with the idea some months ago. None the less, the Government have accepted it and announced a U-turn. Bodies, such as relevant community health councils, should be made aware that the Minister is concerned about the quality of service, and Baroness Cumberlege was asked about it. She said that the Secretary of State
<br><blockquote><p>"will indeed consider the potential benefits in terms of the quality of services to patients."—[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> Tuesday 3 December 1996; Vol. 576, c. 592.]</p></blockquote>
So why not make it an explicit requirement? On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said that the criteria for assessing a pilot's success will vary according to the nature of the pilot that is being promoted. No one can take exception to that statement, but it does not add anything. It has no practical meaning. Firnly including the word "quality" would make it clear that the pilot will be considered in terms of the nature of the service and the benefits that are offered to patients.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will accept the amendment, which is designed to ensure that quality is assessed, in the spirit of the announcement yesterday by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Those who can articulate the experience of the service users should at least know that the review is taking place so that if they wish to continue it they can. I do not suggest that the Minister should write to all of them, but there should at least be some public notice that a review of the pilot is taking place.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to be able to respond to points made by Opposition Members on this series of amendments.<br><br>
The Bill will allow services to be developed by removing the current restraints. That was the basis of the listening exercise and the two documents that followed as a result of that exercise. The hon. Gentleman said that it would be entirely wrong for new arrangements to impose a straitjacket that does not apply to existing arrangements. The question is how best we can do what is required and ensure that primary legislation contains sensible reassurances to underpin the principle without restricting the sort of schemes that might be introduced.<br><br>
I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to clause 1(7), which sets out the definition of personal medical services. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"'personal medical services' means medical services of a kind that may be provided by a general medical practitioner in accordance with arrangements made under Part II".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman may say that we should have gone further and included an additional indicator of quality. But to enshrine any tighter criterion in primary legislation would be to ignore, first, that there is no definition of what exists under part II. The medical profession, in what are acknowledged to be constrained arrangements, have developed the delivery of part II services as innovatively as possible, but the system of delivery is not the same throughout the country. General practitioners play to their professional strengths. We cannot enshrine in legislation a uniquely comparable level table in how services should be provided throughout the country.<br><br>
The Bill will allow services to be developed in a more innovative way and thus improve them, to the mutual benefit of patients and healthcare professionals, who provide the services. The new arrangements must broadly be compatible with the sort of services that are provided, and which the public expects, under the current part II arrangements. The guarantee that at least equal quality will be maintained is contained in the Bill's specific provision that the Secretary of State should approve all pilot proposals. The quality argument comes in at that stage. The Secretary of State's decisions will be informed by the criteria and quality that the national consultative groups are developing. I am grateful to him for acknowledging the work that is being carried out in Scotland and here to develop those criteria. The amendments would add nothing to that process. If there has been any purpose in my making cyrstal clear to the Committee the point about where we are directing ourselves and the mechanisms by which we will do it, I am glad to have had that opportunity.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 pick up on the quality theme. I have no problem with the principles that they are designed to underpin. Of course the Secretary of State will need to be assured that those performing or providing personal medical or dental services should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
pass the same tests as now. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) asked a specific question about indicators for primary care. They are being developed. It was announced in "Primary Care: Delivering the Future" that we would be trialling indicators of effectiveness, not efficiency, at health authority level, and that will continue.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the complaints procedures. I should like to make it crystal clear that at present the complaints arrangements are sustained through the terms of service of general practitioners. They are not enshrined in primary legislation. The equivalent vehicle for ensuring that complaints systems are in place for part I arrangements will be the contract that is negotiated between those who are piloting and the health authority. That is the proper place for it. It would not be right to place it in primary legislation, but perhaps I can give some assurances.<br><br>
Of course we want to be sure that comparable arrangements to those currently in force exist for those who obtain services under the new arrangements. Where trusts employ individuals in new arrangements, the trust complaints procedure will apply, but we believe that complaints procedures will be far more effective within the varied arrangements possible in pilots if the Secretary of State specifies the arrangements in the individual contracts. I hope that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for at least accepting the spirit of the amendments, although clearly we would prefer to see them included in the Bill. In the next group of amendments we will return to the issue of quality, which is relevant to the evaluation of pilots. I must apologise for not having realised that the primary care indicators were dealt with in "Primary Care: Delivering the Future", but that is an English document and part of the problem is that we have not yet received the Scottish equivalent. Perhaps he could convey my concerns about that to the Scottish Health Minister or I may write to him directly to ask whether we shall have similar arrangements in Scotland? I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
