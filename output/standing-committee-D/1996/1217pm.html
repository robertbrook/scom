	<div class='clause'>New Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>CORPORAL PUNISHMENT LAWFUL WITH PARENTAL CONSENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>'For section 548 (no right to give corporal punishment), section 549 (interpretation of section 548) and section 550 (no avoidance of section 548 by refusing admission to school) of the Education Act 1996 the following sections shall be substituted—</p>
	<p>"	<i>Corporal punishment lawful with parental consent.</i></p>
	<p>548.—(1) Where a pupil at a school to which this section applies who has not attained the age of 18 is required on disciplinary grounds to be subjected to corporal punishment at his school, his punishment shall not be unlawful if his parent's consent to it has been given in accordance with subsection (2) and if the conditions set out in subsection (4) are satisfied.
	<ol>
	<li>The admission arrangements for a school to which this section applies may include provisions—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>making it a condition of the admission of every child to the school that his parent gives the admission authority a signed parental declaration either—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>at the time of applying for a place at the school for the child, or</li>
	<li>if the child is allocated a conditional place, within such period as is specified in the arrangements;
<br><br><!-- lb --> that he consents to the use of corporal punishment as one of the measures that may be taken with a view to regulating the conduct of pupils including his child; and</li>
</ol>
	<li>authorising the admission authority to dispense with that condition to any extent in the case of a particular child where they are satisfied that there are special reasons for doing so.</li>
</ol>
	<li>This section applies to—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>a school maintained by a local education authority;</li>
	<li>a grant-maintained or grant-maintained special school; or</li>
	<li>a city technology college or city college for the technology of the arts.</li>
</ol>
	<li>The conditions referred to in subsection (1) are—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>that the head teacher of the school must have previously determined, and made generally known within the school, that corporal punishment is one of the measures that may be taken with a view to regulating the conduct of pupils;</li>
	<li>that the punishment must be imposed by the head teacher or by another teacher at the school specifically or generally authorised by him for the purpose; and</li>
	<li>that the punishment must be reasonable in all the circumstances.</li>
</ol>
	<li>In determining for the purposes of subsection (4)(c) whether a punishment is reasonable, the following matters in particular shall be taken into account—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>whether the punishment constitutes a proportionate punishment in the circumstances of the case; and</li>
	<li>any special circumstances relevant to its imposition on the pupil which are known to the person imposing it (or of which he ought reasonably to be aware) including in particular—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>the pupil's age,</li>
	<li>any special educational needs he may have,</li>
	<li>the pupil's state of health, and</li>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>498</span>
	<li>the pupils's disciplinary record.</li>
</ol></ol>
	<li>Section 572, which provides for the methods by which notices may be served under this Act, does not preclude a notice from being given to a pupil's parent under this section by any other effective method.</li>
	<li>In this section—</li>
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"admission arrangements", in relation to a school means the arrangements for the admission of pupils to the school;</li>
	<li>"conditional place", in relation to a child, means a place which is conditional on the child's parent giving the admission authority a signed parental declaration; and</li>
	<li>"parental declaration" means a declaration to be signed by a parent seeking the admission of his child to the school.</li>

	<p>	<i>Inhuman and degrading punishment.</i></p>
	<p>549. Where, in any proceedings, it is shown that corporal punishment has been given to any pupil in accordance with section 548 above, the punishment cannot be held to be inhuman or degrading.".'.—[	<i>Mr. Pawsey.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed [this day],</i> That the Clause be read a Second time.</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) kept referring to the cane. The new clause of course refers to corporal punishment, and the Minister of State and I would probably prefer the reintroduction of the Scottish strap—the tawse—which was a very civilised way of keeping children well behaved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I attended the same school as the right hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) and the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan). I later discovered that the school janitor used to talk to the master who had been at the school for only three weeks and who were going through merry hell and say, "Academy boys take to the strap very well."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Kilfoyle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Walton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman included in his list of preferred punishments the whalebone, which is what the Jesuits called the piece of equipment with which they used to dispense discipline? He is talking about the cane and the strap; would he add the whalebone to his list?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not speak of anything of which I have not had experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that he would not speak of anything of which he has not had experience. Will he tell us in what circumstances he would envisage a 17-year-old girl being strapped, which the new clause would allow? Can he also give an example of when a five-year-old child might be strapped?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it is ever felt necessary to strap a five-year-old child. The hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), appears to have an obsession with the physical treatment of 17-year-old girls. I would imagine that if there was a headmistress, she could dispense
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0374">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>499</span>
punishment; if there was a senior mistress, she could do it. Clearly, I would expect the senior lady teacher to carry out the punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The headmaster?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I said the senior lady teacher. I thought I made it quite clear that I would expect the punishment of a 17-year-old girl to be carried out by a lady rather than a gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a serious point, and developing the hon. Gentleman's argument, if there is no senior lady teacher, as he so quaintly puts it—or, indeed, any lady teacher—who is prepared to dispense punishment, but there is a headmaster or an appointed, designated male teacher who dispenses punishment, does the hon. Gentleman envisage a male teacher strapping a female pupil?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, we found in Scotland that all teachers were willing to dispense punishment. From my experience of lady teachers in Scotland, I cannot believe that they would be totally unwilling to dispense punishment with the strap. Opposition Members are giving us a fictitious series of suppositions. I spent all my school days in Scotland, and I always found that teachers of both sexes were willing to punish children of both sexes. I also found—I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will confirm this—that a large number of teachers kept discipline without using the strap; if they were good at using it, they did not need to use it. That meant that we had much better discipline than we have today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard about the problem of exclusions, but the other problem is the behaviour that precedes the exclusion. When children misbehave, all the children in the class suffer. One of the reasons that we are so far behind other European countries is that the standard of behaviour in our schools is not as good as it used to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an inconsistency in the hon. Gentleman's argument: no other European country uses corporal punishment, and yet he says that behaviour in those countries is better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that other European countries have their methods of ensuring that people do as they are told—[HON. MEMBERS: "Name one."] The Germans seem to have a system to ensure that people behave. Some of us might not approve of their methods, but it is in the German psyche to do whatever one is told—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would appreciate it if audience reaction were at least kept under control or, even better, channelled into positive interventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is perhaps unfortunate that Opposition members of the Committee treat the matter with levity. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) said this morning that teachers wilfully misinterpret guidelines. He and his colleagues may think that this is a laughing matter, but if one asks
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>500</span>
parents or people who live near schools whether they are satisfied with the behaviour of children, they will say no. If one asks teachers whether they think that they have sufficient means of controlling pupils, they will frequently say no. The only people who believe that the current situation is fine and dandy and needs no correction are members of the Labour party. The people of this country do not support the Labour party, and they will not support it next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept my assurance that we do not see this as a laughing matter? There is nothing funny about state-sanctioned assaults on children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we want to do is to prevent children from assaulting each other. We want to prevent bullying in the classroom and the playground. We want to prevent lessons from being disrupted by behaviour similar to what we see on the Opposition Benches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, in their arguments, the Opposition seem to support the perpetrators of crime, not the victims who are often the bullied children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that some members of the Committee are soft on crime and soft on the causes of crime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, it is appropriate that I should enter the debate at this point. This is a serious discussion about the discipline of children in schools. In principle, I have sympathy with some of the comments made by Opposition members of the Committee but, sadly, they have turned the debate into a burlesque and we seem to have strayed from the original intention of the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was trying to tackle the intractable difficulty of how we should deal with discipline in schools. I sympathise very much with his concerns; indeed, I am sure that the whole Committee shares them. I also share his concern about the fact that, somehow or other, we do not always get to grips with the matter and that head teachers do not always feel that they can get to grips with it as effectively as they would like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that I must say, however, that I cannot support my hon. Friend's new clause. I understand the path that he has gone down in trying to find a solution; it is not perfect, but it is worth considering. He wants parents and teachers to have an additional permissive power so that they can inflict corporal punishment on children, and he stresses that the punishment must be "reasonable".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My difficulty does not lie in what form of corporal punishment is being proposed; it lies in the principal point as to whether, in a modern, civilised society—which is what we are—it is right that we should lower ourselves to cold-bloodedly and calculatingly taking a child to one side and thrashing it. I do not believe that that is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>501</span>
There have been decades—indeed, centuries—of violence against children. We have been trying to shed the terrible burden of what I call violence on violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that corporal punishment dignifies teacher or child, or helps the child. It is all very well for us to hear anecdotal stories along of the lines of, "I was thrashed as a child and it made me a better man", or, as the hon. Member for Walton said, "I happened to have the character to withstand corporal punishment." I talked about the issue with my father who is now 86 and he, too, said that he was thrashed severely and that he was fine now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He was also a very good Member of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He was indeed, and he is very good now in the other place. However, in today's society we have to ask how we can instill discipline in young people without resorting to violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the point about what one is trying to acheive by inflicting corporal punishment, the idea is that a child will become more co-operative and better behaved. There is no evidence that that happens, but there is evidence that a child who is badly behaved and out of control will not respond to that sort of violence because he is already part of a violent society. If anything, a child who is almost beyond control needs psychiatric help. My hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth said that corporal punishment should be used as a last resort before excluding a child. I do not think that corporal punishment would make any difference to behaviour in schools. Exclusion is a separate issue. The real question is how schools can deal successfully with tough discipline problems. Such success comes from leadership that is determined and has a great sense of direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A school in my constituency was, about six years ago, a non-selective bin school that parents dreaded their children attending—they feared that they would turn out thugs or worse; they would certainly be low achievers. Then a new headmaster came along who had a tremendous sense of faith in what was possible for those children, Master and Miss Average. He believed in two things: that he could raise their level of academic achievement, which he has undoubtedly done—he pushes them like hell—and that he should not tolerate bad behaviour. When he arrived at the school, it was famous for a child who was so out of control that he had ridden a motorcycle through the school corridors. I am not saying that the school does not resort to exclusions, but when pupils misbehave they are given many chances. On one occasion, the headmaster—I had to intervene to help him in this case—was faced with a young, insolent thug. He sent the boy home and told him that he must stay there until he came back dressed in uniform, with his parents, and apologised. After a certain amount of persuasion and working with the parents—who are often the source of the problem as they can back a child who is being ticked off, which is unhelpful to the school—the child complied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>502</span>
That point takes us to an important element of the issue of discipline—if parents are indisciplined in their own lives and chaotic in their family lives, with a mix of people who are meant to be caring for the child—a mother with a partner or stepfather, for example—it makes things more difficult. One thing is sure: thrashing such a child will not make him more secure or more productive. I know what my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth is trying to achieve, but I have to say, with regret, that I do not believe that in a civilised modern society we should ever be party to such a method of discipline. I therefore respectfully suggest that my hon. Friend withdraws the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have rarely found myself in so much agreement with the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Lady Olga Maitland). I want to make three brief points in the hope of persuading the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth to do as the hon. Lady suggests and withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to put it on the record that, regardless of any arguments about the value or otherwise of corporal punishment, I am fundamentally opposed to it as a matter of principle. As I have said, at a time when we are trying to reduce levels of violence in society, the reintroduction of a violent form of punishment will not assist in meeting that end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pick up on three points made by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth and ask him to attempt to respond to them genuinely in a way that he has so far failed to do. He argued that he was concerned about the large number of children who are excluded, temporarily or permanently, from schools. He said that that is not necessarily the best form of sanction and he was worried about its impact on excluded children. The hon. Gentleman then suggested that the reintroduction of caning in certain schools would reduce the number of exclusions. Will he give the Committee evidence to back that contention—evidence other than his oft-stated belief that caning will reduce exclusions, as all the evidence is to the contrary?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that we are concerned about the level of indiscipline in schools. That is true, and the Government are introducing several measures that will receive support from the Committee because they will help the situation. The hon. Gentleman was right to say that genuine concern is felt throughout the Committee about the level of indiscipline, but he would have us believe that the reintroduction of corporal punishment in some schools will help to reduce it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee needs the hon. Gentleman to provide evidence that corporal punishment will work because, yet again, all the evidence is to the contrary—so much so that not one European country, either eastern or western, believes that corporal punishment has a part to play. Furthermore, not one teachers union believes that corporal punishment will reduce the level of indiscipline, nor do head teachers who would be required to administer it.

If the hon. Gentleman is to sustain any logical argument, it is incumbent upon him to give us some clear evidence to justify the reintroduction of corporal punishment. My three points are, first, that corporal punishment is wrong in principle; secondly, that it will not help with the problem of exclusion; and, thirdly, that it will not help with the problems of indiscipline. We all look forward to the hon. Gentleman's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It gives me no pleasure to say to my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth that I will be unable to recommend to the Committee, on behalf of the Government, that it should support the new clause. My brief outlines several technical defects in the proposal, but I shall not weary the Committee with them because such matters do not always make a convincing argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether or not the lack of a satisfactory definition of corporal punishment in the Bill is a definitive argument is an interesting thought and one on which some members of the Committee may wish to pause. I am not sure, however, that it is a fatal flaw. Reference is often made to matters that are cruel, degrading and inhuman and we are all assumed to know what that phrase means, but I am not sure that it takes us further forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to what I believe are much more substantial difficulties with my hon. Friend's new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is connected with the European convention on human rights. If the new clause were to be implemented, it would be likely to lead to successful claims that the United Kingdom's obligations under the European convention on human rights had been violated. I think specifically of article 3 of the main treaty, on inhuman and degrading treatment, and article 2 of protocol 1, on respect for the philosophical objections of parents to corporal punishment. I should like to explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Previous cases considered by the European Court indicate that article 2 of protocol 1 would be found to have been violated if a child had been denied admission to a school because of the parents' objections to corporal punishment. That would be the case even if a place was made available for the child at another suitable school nearby where such punishment was not used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, although the parents might agree to sign the requisite declaration to obtain a place for the child at a school, they would be free to change their minds subsequently and write to the school withdrawing consent for corporal punishment to be administered. It is clear that article 2 would be violated if the school was to administer punishment despite the parents' revised wishes, or if the school excluded the child because of the parents' principled objection to that form of punishment. In any case, such an exclusion could be lawfully effected only as a result of an appropriate disciplinary offence; the pupil could not be excluded simply because of the parents' views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>504</span>
Proposed new section 549 provides that corporal punishment administered in accordance with proposed new section 548 could not be held to be "inhuman or degrading". However, although the punishment would have to be
	<br><blockquote><p>"reasonable in all the circumstances",</p></blockquote>
in some circumstances, a fairly harsh beating in response to a pupil's serious misconduct might be "reasonable" under the amendment even though the European court had ruled it to be inhuman and degrading and hence a violation of article 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause abolishes the requirement that corporal punishment administered to privately funded pupils at independent schools must not be inhuman or degrading. That would open the way for cases to be brought that such punishment had violated article 3. By repealing the existing provisions of the 1996 Act, publicly funded pupils at independent schools other than at city technology colleges or the city college for the technology of the arts would no longer be safeguarded. Corporal punishment without parental consent of pupils on assisted places would probably be regarded as having breached article 2 of protocol 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been through that in some detail because, in spite of the ingenuity of my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth in his careful drafting, I am advised that the new clause would not circumvent or otherwise allow us to get round the provisions of the European convention on human rights, to which, as my hon. Friend knows, the United Kingdom remains a signatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other arguments against the new clause have been touched on by Opposition Members. For example, the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) asked whether the administration of corporal punishment would deter bad behaviour and indiscipline. An analysis of school punishment books prior to the abolition of corporal punishment revealed that some pupils' names appeared repeatedly, suggesting that the sanction did not have the claimed deterrent effect. The hon. Member for Walton suggested that although the name Kilfoyle, and perhaps the name Forth, may have appeared repeatedly in the punishment books of their respective schools, those individuals apparently continue to repeat their offences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the fact that some names did not appear mean that those people were deterred by the possibility of corporal punishment? The fact is that behaviour has worsened since corporal punishment was stopped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall never know the answer to my hon. Friend's question. As for his contention about the worsening of behaviour, we all regret what is often perceived as a general worsening of social behaviour—including road rage, drunkenness, dropping litter or even the behaviour of parents, which we have referred to time and again. I subscribe to the view, at least in part, that any worsening of pupil behaviour can be ascribed largely to the failure of parents, and their unwillingness or inability to provide that framework

of discipline in the home that should supplement and complement what the teachers try to achieve in school. It is a more complicated issue than is suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that the Minister is inexorably moving in the direction of disappointing the hon. Members for Rugby and Kenilworth, for Gravesham (Mr. Arnold), for Dover (Mr. Shaw) and for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall). The hon. Member for Hendon, South said that Opposition Members who do not agree with the new clause support lack of discipline in schools and are not in favour of the maintenance of law and order in schools. Does the Minister consider himself to be in that category?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I consider that the healthy debate on this subject shows an honest difference among Conservative Members, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam showed so ably. I do not feel in any way belittled or diminished by the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, South. He has one point of view; I have another. If the hon. Member for Devonport is suggesting that the monolithic approach that he and his hon. Friends are taking is in some way superior to honest debate and the differences of view among Conservative Members, I am sorry for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that he is expressing a different point of view to that of some of his hon. Friends. He is expressing the Government's point of view, but is it also his personal point of view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is neither here nor there. As the hon. Gentleman has conceded, my job is to express the Government's point of view, which is what I am seeking to do. On behalf of the Government, I shall either ask my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth to consider withdrawing the motion or, if there is a Division, I shall advise the Committee to vote against it for the reasons that I am striving to give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in some confusion. The Minister says that he represents the Government's point of view. In this instance, who speaks for the Government—is it the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, who seems to have one point of view, or does the Prime Minister's point of view obtain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this Committee, I speak for the Government, and I expect the rest of the Government to fall in line with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes; I am on a roll.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are indeed pleased to note that the Minister speaks for the Government in this Committee, but does the Secretary of State for Education and Employment agree with him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Secretary of State were a member of the Committee, I would fully expect her to vote in exactly the way that I recommend the Committee to vote on the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>506</span>
Let us not be premature; I have not finished my argument. Although I might well have persuaded the bulk of the Committee of my point of view, I have another couple of shots in my locker, and I should like to deploy them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not ignore the important fact that, in the time that I have been at the Department, no representative of teachers, heads or governors has asked for the restoration of corporal punishment in schools. My hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth uses an argument, which I have used in the Committee, about the permissive nature of his proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gravesham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not fairly clear to my hon. Friend that no such approach has been made to him for precisely the reason that he gave earlier? Whether the Committee or Parliament likes it or not, because of the European convention on human rights and interpretations of the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights, we cannot make a free, sovereign, democratic choice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is clear is that, so long as the United Kingdom remains a signatory to the convention, the analysis that I have given applies and, of course, the advice that I have holds sway. I leave it to my hon. Friend to judge whether or not that is a definitive factor in heads, teachers and governors not wanting corporal punishment to be available to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that, when I canvassed the head teachers in my constituency, they did not raise concerns about the European Court of Human Rights? They simply said very clearly that they had no taste for inflicting any sort of corporal punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to refresh the Committee's memory, I was telling my hon. Friend the Minister about my constituency where I have not heard of a single head teacher seeking the right to inflict corporal punishment. If the powers were given to head teachers in Sutton and Cheam, they would not use them. Therefore, I do not believe that they should be put onto the statute book in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the evidence certainly points in that direction. It is significant that we have received no representations from teacher bodies asking for that sanction to be made available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point stems from the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth in moving the new clause. He sought to make a distinction—at some length, but I understand why—between exclusion as a punishment and corporal punishment. While he was speaking, I wondered whether it was better not only for the individual but for the other pupils in the school to remove a difficult or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>507</span>
disruptive pupil, or whether it was better to keep him at school and perhaps regularly administer corporal punishment. At the very least, it is a matter of judgment which of those two measures would be more effective. I was not completely convinced by my hon. Friend's argument that instead of excluding difficult and disruptive pupils, one should administer corporal punishment as that would be self-evidently better for the pupil and the other pupils. That is arguable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all the reasons that I mentioned—the European convention, the lack of demand and support from head teachers and teachers, and the point made by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) that there is no empirical evidence that corporal punishment has the beneficial result that my hon. Friend claims—I regret that I shall have to ask the Committee not to support the motion if my hon. Friend presses it to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Pawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In one bound he was free; I refer to the hon. Member for Walton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Walton raised a number of points and asked why certain matters were not included in the new clause, but some of them are included. For example, he asked who would be involved in the administration of corporal punishment, which is clearly set out in subsection (4)(b). He asked about the proportion of the punishment and I said that it would be "reasonable", which is referred to in subsection (4)(c) of the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that he was speaking for those least able to speak for themselves. It was a reference to those who receive corporal punishment. That argument would have carried a great deal more weight had he not earlier advised the Committee that he had been caned. My hon. Friend the Minister and I have also been caned, yet we have no difficulty in speaking for ourselves. The hon. Gentleman was quite wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not yet, but I shall in a moment. The hon. Member for Walton was ungenerous, which is unusual for him. He said that I was advocating new clause 1 for political purposes. That is not so; I am advocating it because I believe in corporal punishment. I believe that it would materially assist the quality and standard of British education by improving discipline in the classroom. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept what I have said because I mean it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer the hon. Gentleman back to something that he said a few moments ago about those for whom we are prepared to speak. It is our duty to speak for those who cannot defend themselves—and when I said that I was speaking on behalf of those who could not defend themselves, I was talking about children. It is one thing to get to the stage that we, as Members of Parliament, are at of having the luxury of speaking not only for ourselves, but for all sorts of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>508</span>
interests; I was talking about children who have been bullied and intimidated by adults who have wreaked havoc with cane, strap or tawse—call it what one wants. Those children had no one to speak for them; the climate was such that it was deemed to be a good thing of itself that children should be hit. It was thought that brutalisation somehow had a salutary effect, and we have heard echoes of that today, despite the fact that even the Minister has acknowledged that that is not the case either educationally or personally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman says accurately reflects the time of which he has experience, but he will agree that, thanks to the Government's reforms, there is now far greater parental involvement in the running of schools than was ever the case in the period to which he refers. Through their parents and their representatives on governing bodies, children now have a greater say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both my hon. Friend the Minister and the hon. Member for Walton made play of the European aspect. I say very gently to the hon. Member for Walton that he is wrong. Equally, I say to my hon. Friend the Minister that the advice that he has received is incorrect. The European Court of Human Rights did not rule under article 3 that corporal punishment in schools is degrading either generally or in any particular case. That is a statement of fact. Europe is something of a red herring. I say with regret that, in the early 1980s, the then Education Department got itself caught on a hook from which it does not seem able to escape. That is unfortunate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pray in aid a second leg to my argument. In 1986, an amendment that I tabled to the then Education Bill was lost on the Floor of the House by one vote. My amendment, which enjoyed the support of Ministers, would have enabled parents to opt in to corporal punishment. Ministers would not have agreed that opting in was a way round the European Court's judgment if that were not the case. It is the case. With great respect; my hon. Friend the Minister is a good bloke, but he is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that the integrity and professionalism of the civil service—not just in my Department; we have also taken Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice on the matter—would preclude it from giving advice that was not the best that it could give and that was not completely impartial? I am, of course, relaying to the Committee the advice that I have received about the relevance of the convention and court rulings to the matter that my hon. Friend has raised. I am simply giving that advice in the way in which it was given to me. I would reject any suggestion that it is biased or that there is a hidden agenda as an unwarranted and uncharacteristic attack on the integrity of the civil service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never expected to hear my hon. Friend the Minister claiming the doctrine of papal infallibility for his Department. His Department can be wrong; it can make mistakes. I refer again to the European Court ruling 9471/81. I shall not go on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>509</span>
about that, as I know that the Committee wants to make progress, but I tell my hon. Friend the Minister that there are clearly two views on the matter and it would be unwise to get hung up on a specific view. I appreciate that that could apply equally to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a particularly wide-ranging debate, which has been conducted in a spirit of reasonable humour and has done much to illuminate an important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the hon. Member for Gravesham drew extensively on his local government experience in Northamptonshire; his speech was especially thoughtful, and I hope that the Committee will consider the points that he made. My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, South made a strong speech and a powerful case. It is worth while remembering that, as he said, 68 per cent. of parents support the idea of returning corporal punishment to the nation's schools. I was also interested to hear what he said about Opposition Members being soft on crime and soft on the causes of crime; it is not for me to comment on that, but I found it an interesting point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was dismayed to hear the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam. She expressed sympathy with my expressed concerns but, sadly, she was not totally convinced by my arguments.—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> She is soft-hearted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can recommend two things to the hon. Member for Bath. First, concerning the question of trade union support, I refer him to an excellent book written by Peter Dawson, the former general secretary of the Professional Association of Teachers, entitled 	<i>"Making a Comprehensive Work".</i> In the chapter entitled "Discipline", he strongly advocates corporal punishment and describes the good that it does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also pray in aid of a second notable headmaster, my right hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North (Sir R. Boyson). I recommend that the hon. Member for Bath buys 	<i>"Boyson on Education".</i> If he purchases those two books, he will find the answers to the questions that he asked.

	<br><blockquote><p>'At the end of section 156 (exclusion of pupils from county, voluntary or maintained special schools) of the Education Act 1966 there shall be inserted:

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that we shall spend rather less time on this new clause than on two previous debates on important issues—the debate on the dress code introduced by the hon. Member for Dover and the debate that we have just had on corporal punishment introduced by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. We agree that they are important issues, although we may have disagreed about the new clauses and their effects. I want under this new clause to raise a third issue: the publicity given to school exclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise that issue bearing in mind publicity within my constituency which has attended the exclusion of a five-year-old. That exclusion was highlighted in the press prior to its being considered by the governors of the school. The governors considered the case for quite a long time; the first time that they considered it, they did not reach a decision, but they later decided that the pupil should be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was then another batch of publicity, and as a result, the five-year-old found himself on ITV, on 	<i>"The Big Breakfast"</i> and on various other television shows—I think that Sky television interviewed him. He was widely seen throughout the country on those shows; he was featured and his domestic circumstances were shown. He was a child with somewhat unusual habits; he watched videos by himself when he wanted to and he demonstrated somewhat unusual behaviour for a five-year-old, which was shown by the television cameras.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as the Department is aware, in every case that has—regrettably, in my view—been publicised, the information has come from the parents. We know of no case in which anyone else has divulged that confidential information. Parents often think that it is in their and their child's interests to invite the media to give exposure to the case. Does the hon. Gentleman share that experience?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to come to that point. I accept that the parents in the case in my constituency were responsible for its being publicised and for giving out the name of the child, and that parents inform the press in other cases, such as that of the boy who caused the closure of Manton school in Nottinghamshire. Perhaps the one case where some publicity was initially generated by a source other than the parents was the Ridings school in Halifax, in which the media took a great interest. I accept the Minister's point that we do not know of any case of a school divulging the name of a pupil, although we know plenty of cases of parents doing so, and I also accept that that is a weakness of my new clauses. As I said, I moved them because the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>511</span>
issue of publicity surrounding exclusions should be of concern to the Department and to those interested in the welfare of pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As in the instance in my constituency, the way in which the media have attended an excluded pupil means that far from a child being deterred from his behaviour by the exclusion, he is rewarded by travelling to distant studios and having a great life—certainly that is how a five-year-old would perceive it. One gets a sense that excluded children who are highlighted in the press take on the role of heroes, which reinforces the behaviour that exclusion exists, as we have said, to punish and correct. If the way in which the media treat such cases means that children are rewarded for their bad behaviour, exclusion has the opposite effect to that intended. We must express concern about that and I hope that the Minister will share the concern that I would have thought we all feel about media intrusion into exclusion cases; perhaps the Department will consider how it can deal with that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the technical defects of the new clauses. One is aimed at children in LEA schools and the other at children in grant-maintained schools. In both cases governors should—in the case of an LEA school, they must do so—inform the authorities about exclusions. That is important in regard to grant-maintained schools because an excluded pupil would not necessarily be found a place in another grant-maintained school, which would have implications for an LEA. Different LEAs may be involved, because there are many instances of children crossing authority boundaries to go to school, as a result of the Greenwich judgment, in which case another authority would have to be informed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not cover that eventuality in my new clauses, but we should recognise the importance of the issue. Indeed, it was one of the issues discussed by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities when it held its annual education conference recently in Salford. It wanted to have a code drafted to cover such situations. I felt that such a code should protect the privacy of individual children—which is what I suggest in my new clause—prevent offensive and intrusive press behaviour at schools and promote responsible behaviour by journalists in reporting issues concerning children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are serious concerns about press behaviour in the case of the Ridings school. I recognise that discussions about the school are far from complete, but the chairman of Calderdale education committee told the conference that photographers had used a crane outside the school as a vantage point from which to train their zoom cameras inside the classrooms and that that contributed to the breakdown in school discipline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are complaints that the media had named pupils excluded from the school for misbehaviour, but were legally obliged to protect their anonymity if they committed offences serious enough for juvenile court
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>512</span>
appearances. It is clear that children get far better protection from the juvenile courts when they have been involved in criminal cases than children who are excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that, at this stage, the divulging of names has always been by parents who thought that it was to their advantage and that of their children to gain the publicity. That is not a view with which we can concur. In almost every case, giving a name harms the child and makes it far more difficult to resolve the situation, which is what we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The AMA wrote about its concerns to the Press Complaints Commission, which replied that its code of practice had recently been amended in relation to young people and now states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Journalists should not normally interview or photograph children under the age of 16 on subjects involving the welfare of the child or of any other child in the absence of or without the consent of the parent or other adult who is responsible for the children.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Children should not be approached or photographed while at school without permission of the school authorities."</p></blockquote>
Apart from the exclusions at the Ridings, in the other cases that have been widely reported in the press the parents have been consulted. There were undoubtedly children at the Ridings who received publicity without parental consent. The photographs of the child in my constituency linked that child with another child whose photograph also appeared in the press, although there was no indication that she had been excluded. The mother in that case was horrified to see the picture of her child in the paper just because she happened to be standing next to the child who was excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's new clause states that the people involved
	<br><blockquote><p>"may not divulge the name of a pupil either facing or undergoing exclusion".</p></blockquote>
Interestingly, the hon. Gentleman has cited an example of such pupils. Does not that suggest that the new clause would not, in fact, deal with the case that he has just mentioned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have explained that I tabled the new clause so that I could raise the matter of publicity. I will not hesitate to withdraw the motion, but I will do so in the hope that the Minister will say that the Department will consider this matter, which is of concern to people who have at heart the behaviour of children in school, especially when that behaviour leads to exclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite our differences of opinion, surely we would all agree that children reach the point of being excluded for behavioural reasons that are of considerable concern to us. We must consider ways both of protecting those children and of reinforcing the lesson that the school wants to give—that is, that repetition of such behaviour will ill serve the child and, therefore, that there must be a means of correction. The worst that can happen is that children find themselves in a pivotal role on television or in the press because of their actions.

It has become necessary to consider that matter because of a series of cases that have hit the headlines in recent weeks which have given certain children undue and ill-deserved notoriety. We must find ways of dealing with such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I recognise the problem that the hon. Gentleman has identified, but the question is whether the new clause would solve it. The lack of sanctions is the first difficulty that we have identified with the approach that the hon. Gentleman has taken. It is one thing to say, "Thou shalt not", but as no effective sanctions are available, the new clause would be rendered ineffective. Simply telling people that they must not do something does not get us very far, unless we can say, "If you do that, something horrible will happen to you."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Staffordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I recognise the contention that my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) put forward, it would take more than an Act of Parliament to make some of our media responsible—it would take an act of God. However, if school governors and staff did not carry out a duty that we had placed upon them, it would be open to the child's parents to take them to court and seek damages. Surely that sanction is open to them as some form of redress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman will want to reflect on that intervention because I understand that it might have become the policy of his party to seek to protect schools against such litigation. I might be wrong, but I think that a leading spokesman from his party said that recently in response to a similar case. I say that not to create trouble among Opposition Members—I would not dream of doing such a thing—but to illustrate the difficulty of such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is that we are dealing with the possibility of behaviour of which we all disapprove—in other words, the revealing of young children's names and details to the press, which might be damaging to those children, their parents and so on. The problem is how best to tackle such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am restricting myself to telling the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South that I do not believe that the new clauses would solve that problem—first, because of the lack of sanctions and, secondly, because we know of no cases in which information was divulged by those named in the new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem seems to lie much more with the parents who believe—however misguidedly—that it will help their child's case if they take their side of the story to the media and obtain enough exposure. I would have thought it evident that that is rarely, if ever, the case, but that does not seem to stop them believing that it is. One is left with the suspicion that, regrettably, there are some parents who become as hooked on self-publicity as—dare I say—some of our colleagues are from time to time. The trouble is that the average Member of Parliament is in a position to be much more thick-skinned—and perhaps even to enjoy such exposure—than are the average parents who, when they let the genie out of the bottle or the cat
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>514</span>
out of the bag, realise that they cannot put it back again—if the Committee will forgive a multiple metaphor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify a point about sanctions. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) commented on damages related to potential cases of pupils suing a school because they had not fulfilled their academic potential; that is a slightly different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An analogy can be found in local government; there is a requirement for members of a local authority not to reveal to the press details of a matter under consideration. As far as I am aware, there is no specific sanction if a member does reveal details, but there is still a requirement to maintain confidentiality. Could not such a situation apply to schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one is into declaratory law-making, I suppose it could. I am not convinced that it is a terribly good idea simply to sprinkle laws with wishful thinking and hope that they will work. Given the nature of the offences that we are discussing and the likelihood of people committing them, we should avoid introducing such measures unless we can demonstrate that there will be a sanction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clauses would limit the number and type of parties who might be entitled to know the names of excluded pupils. We have identified at least two groups—social services and the police—for whom it may be beneficial to be given the name of the pupil in some circumstances. We should not, therefore, arbitrarily or unnecessarily place restrictions on who may be given information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention that again to illustrate the difficulties that arise, but I acknowledge the spirit in which the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South tabled the new clauses. The Government and the Department share his concerns, and we are very much aware of the problem, which seems to be manifesting itself ever more frequently. We shall certainly look for ways of protecting individual pupils—even, on occasion, from their own parents. That will be difficult, but given that the hon. Gentleman has highlighted the problem, we shall try to establish whether there is anything that can properly and reasonably be done, even in the light of what I have said about the new clauses. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply. I recognised from the start that the new clauses were flawed in a number of ways. I entirely accept that the question whether social services are involved is relevant. I have no doubt that social services departments are involved with many families whose children have been excluded, and I accept that it would not be wise for any measure to preclude them from finding solutions and providing help for the child—the new clauses, as drafted, do not properly deal with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the new clauses were a vehicle for me to raise the issue, and I am glad that the Minister has taken on board the fact that we should turn our minds to the matter so that we can find out whether there is an effective way in which we can protect children.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>515</span>
We may, indeed have to protect them from their parents. I knew that before I started, but I could not devise a way of incorporating such protection in the Bill. It is a difficult matter, but I am pleased that the Minister has said that he will ask the Department whether we can include some provision to help to resolve the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that the publicity for the incident that occurred in my constituency did not come from the head or the governing body. The case will go to an independent appeal. The mother has already expressed her view about what should happen. The independent group will make its decision in the best interests of the child. However, it will be concerned about the degree of publicity, which will make it difficult for the child to settle back into his original environment. We should do all we can to ensure that such incidents do not result in publicity for individual children. Perhaps parallel rulings to those that apply to the juvenile courts could be introduced through relevant legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that often it is the parents who highlight matters, but they might take a different view if it involves a criminal court appearance. In such cases parents might be happy for anonymity to apply. We must persuade parents that although exclusion must be used sparingly, it has to be used in some circumstances, and that is it their responsibility, and that of the school, to act constructively.

	<section>
	<div class='title'>AMENDMENTS TO SECTION 19 OF THE EDUCATION ACT 1996</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>'(1) Section 19 of the Education Act 1996 shall be amended as follows—
	<ol>
	<li>In subsection (1) the words "part-time" shall be omitted.</li>
	<li>In subsection (4) the words "part-time" shall be omitted.—[	<i>Mr. Win Griffiths.</i>]</li>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause probes the concept of part-time education—a concept that we believe should have been omitted from the 1996 Act. Of course, we appreciate that, in some circumstances, part-time education is appropriate. For example, a child receiving stressful chemotherapy might not be capable of undertaking full-time education. However, the way in which the 1996 Act refers to full-time and part-time education has led some schools and LEAs to do less than justice to children who should receive full-time education. Parents have a duty to ensure that their children receive full-time education. That duty is included in section 7 of the 1996 Act and replicates a provision in the 1944 Act. Therefore, part-time education could mean that a parent is in default.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>516</span>
Full-time education need not mean the number of hours that a child would usually attend school. In the case of home tuition, it could be argued that full-time education should not cover the whole school day because of the intensity of the education and the one-to-one relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we do not believe that a local authority should have the fall-back that if a child is getting an hour or two of home tuition, its responsibility has been covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent, the issue could be dealt with if parents actively pursued their children's interests via the code of practice. A child who is excluded would obviously be subject to identification and assessment of special needs, whatever those might be. With exclusions, we are usually talking about a behavioural problem. In assessing a child, it should be clear that there is a need for full-time education of some sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Full-time education need not necessarily take place on the school's premises. Excellent work has been done by Cities in Schools, where disaffected children who disrupt classes undermine the education of many other children. I have seen the work of Cities in Schools in the Vale of Glamorgan—my neighbouring constituency—under what used to be South Glamorgan county council. There is scope for providing full-time education in a different context, which can successfully give formerly disaffected and disruptive children with behavioural problems new aspirations and goals and an interest in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence that we have had from the Home Office research unit and the Audit Commission suggests that children who are not in school and who receive part-time education—often very little—are those who end up in trouble with the police and in the criminal courts. I hope that the Minister will respond in a way that will enable us to rewrite that part of the law on the type of education a child should receive to ensure that the alternative of part-time provision is not taken as a get-out clause on children who should receive an education. I am probing for a way to ensure that disruptive children receive a proper, full-time education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At present, LEAs can fulfil their statutory duty under section 19 of the Education Act 1996 in a number of ways and can tailor their provision to the needs and circumstances of individual pupils who are out of school. By insisting on the provision of full-time education for all pupils, regardless of their circumstances, the clause could prohibit LEAs from making the most suitable provision in many cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, I have in mind those pupils who are coming to the end of their compulsory school lives. The peak ages for exclusion are 14 and 15. Many of those pupils are disaffected with normal schooling. A number of LEAs have sought to remotivate such pupils by putting together a package of provision according to individual needs. That is where something like Cities in Schools comes in, as the hon. Member for Bridgend said. Such provision often involves a couple of days a week at a further education college or a couple of days work experience. That sort
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>517</span>
of provision often works to turn round youngsters who would otherwise be at risk of dropping out of mainstream society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the Minister. However, my particular concern is that some children are, unfortunately, given part-time education under section 19. They should be given full-time education. I recognise that a parent pursuing the needs of a child by using the code of practice might get that put right in some cases, but unfortunately, that will not always happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but I am not sure that the amendment is the right way to solve the problem. It is unnecessarily prescriptive and also contains the usual definitional or drafting problems. It does not contain a deifinition of full-time tuition and it is not clear whether the term "education" should or would encompass the kind of mixed Cities in Schools provisions. Those are serious, and not just definitional or practical, problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill suggests that we tackle the problem by requiring LEAs to produce proper and detailed plans that set out how they will deal with different circumstances and different pupils. It also contains a provision for an inspection of LEAs to ensure that they are making proper provision. That is the best approach to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) said. I share his worry that some education authorities do not take such an important part of their responsiblities sufficiently seriously. One way or another—through neglect, incompetence or a wrong-headed desire to save money—they fail to make proper provision for excluded pupils. Pupils who are excluded or who have behavioural difficulties are the most vulnerable. They most need proper provision and education. They should not and must not be neglected. There is no difference between us on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment's wording misses the target. In a funny way, it is unduly prescriptive and would not achieve the result that the hon. Gentleman and I want. The new requirement for LEAs to produce plans, which will have far-reaching effects, and the requirement, which I hope that the Committee will support, for inspection of LEAs will together lead us in the direction that the hon. Gentleman wishes to go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought of asking another question, but I thought that I might be wrong again. We know that so much of an LEA's money is delegated to the local management of schools, but where do the excluded pupils of grant-maintained schools fit in? Is an LEA responsible for those pupils? If so, how is the funding arranged?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a reasonable question. The funding provisions and the extraordinarily complicated formulae of SSAs, grants to grant-maintained schools and delegated budgets through LEAs to schools are all designed to cover basic provision for pupils, but they are overlaid by a series of layers. Some layers are designed to provide for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>518</span>
pupils with sepcial educational needs in mainstream provision and special schools and others deal with common provision, such as transport, educational psychologists and for those pupils out of school. The funding provisions are designed to cover all that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could have endless arguments about whether the funding provisions work adequately. However, I would claim that they get as close to that aim as is possible. They combine fairness with transparency, comprehensibility and so on. None the less, I would be going too far if I claimed that they were the last word in perfection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to carify one point. Is the Minister saying that an LEA has a sum of money that it does not allocate to local schools, including grant-maintained schools, and that it uses that money to make provision for items such as transport and psychologists and to deal with excluded pupils in its catchment area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is more or less the case. That fits in with the argument on which I wish to conclude. In requiring LEAs to produce proper plans of provision, we expect them for the first time to set out clearly, so that everyone can see, how they will discharge their responsibilities and use the funds available in a transparent and accountable manner. That will enable us to satisfy ourselves that they deal with the pupils that the hon. Member for Bridgend has rightly identified in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, there is common ground between us. I hope that I have said enough to satisfy the hon. Gentleman that we can achieve the objectives that we share, but by a different route. The new clause would not achieve that, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I recognise that for some children, for particular reasons, part-time education is appropriate. However, I want to look at some other ways of strengthening the requirement for children normally to receive full-time provision, perhaps by issuing guidance to authorities to give specific reasons for a child receiving only part-time education.

The new clause would amend the Education Act 1996. It covers section 158 of that Act, which is headed "Reinstatement of excluded pupils" and which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schedule 15 has effect in relation to the reinstatement of pupils excluded from county, voluntary or maintained special schools."</p></blockquote>
The new clause is an amendment to paragraph 2 of schedule 15, which refers to the reinstatement of permanently excluded pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would require at each decisive stage of the appeals process relating to exclusions that the interests of other pupils and staff at the school are considered in addition to those of the pupil being excluded. Clause 24(4) and paragraph 8 of schedule 3 of the Bill rightly introduce the requirement that in considering the reinstatement of an excluded pupil, the appeal committee
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall have regard to both the interests of that pupil and the interests of other pupils at his school and members of its staff."</p></blockquote>
We discussed that point this morning when there was some disagreement about how the interests of the staff would be defined, but I shall not go back over old ground. Rather than introducing the measure at the final stage of the exclusion process, it would be sensible to establish consistent criteria against which a decision to exclude can be properly judged. The same obligations should be required throughout all the appeals stages. Consistent criteria throughout the appeals process would ensure that criticisms of the procedure and consideration would be more easily identified, thereby reducing the likelihood of a judicial review and costs to the LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is accepted that consideration for other pupils and staff is valid in deciding whether to uphold a head teacher's decision to exclude at the final appeal, should not that also be made clear at the earlier appeals proceedings? We accept that a school is a community,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>520</span>
which includes all pupils and teachers. Therefore, in an appeal against a permanent exclusion, the interests of the entire school should be considered before deciding whether the pupil should be reinstated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause asks merely that the interests of the whole school community are considered at every stage in the appeals process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mrs. Cheryl Gillan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 15 of the 1996 Act does not go into such detail on arrangements for LEAs and governing bodies when considering the reinstatement of pupils at the first stages of the exclusion procedure, nor was it intended to do so. The hon. Gentleman, through the new clause, is endeavouring to replicate clauses 24 and 25, which relate to the independent exclusion appeal committees and require those committees, when considering reinstatement, to consider the interests of other pupils and members of staff at the school as well as those of the excluded pupil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
LEAs and governing bodies are closer to the life of the school than independent appeal committees and naturally will take account of the wider interests of the school in considering reinstatement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 15 allows significant flexibility at local level in the handling of procedures for hearing parents' representations. That seems right given the variation in local circumstances, and I would not want to lay down detailed procedures in statute for those first stages of the appeal arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the reasonable point that it is important to ensure that the wider interests of the school are never overlooked when reinstatement is being considered. I give the hon.

The earlier comments of the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth are echoed in this proposal, which would put into law something that is already contained in Government guidance. Circular 10/94 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State believes that it should be clear in each case of permanent exclusion that:
	<br><blockquote><p>it is a last resort: the school has taken all reasonable steps to avoid excluding the child; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>allowing the child to remain in school would be seriously detrimental to the education or welfare of the pupil, or to that of others at the school."</p></blockquote></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the Minister of State nodding vigorously in agreement. The matter is one of fact. There is no dispute as to the content of the Goverment's guidance. The guidance virtually replicates a Labour amendment and that was tabled to the Education Act 1993, so it must be all right. Once again the Goverment have taken sage advice from the Opposition—long may that continue. After all, many principles in the latter parts of the Bill are straightforward adaptations of Labour party policy. That is preparation for when we step into government shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the spirit of the festive season, will the hon. Gentleman agree that it is a quite legitimate, and indeed, laudable, aspect of civilised politics that political parties occasionally see merit in what other parties say or do, and come round to their point of view?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is odd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport said from a sedentary position, odd, but it is so, and I accede to what the Minister said. Nevertheless, it is important to record the instance that I have identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that all members of the Committee, if not everyone outside the House, would agree that depriving a child of education is undesirable. It is clear from the evidence that once pupils have been formally excluded, their chances of completing a successful school career are dramatically reduced. Everyone agrees that the formal sanction of permanent exclusion should be used only as a last resort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister looks inquiringly, waiting for me to make a slip. However, perhaps he would agree that it has recently been shown that huge numbers of people who have been excluded from school seem to disappear completely from all records, with many undesirable consequences for them and society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from the recent Ofsted report that the use of permanent exclusion is patchy. Ofsted's press release of 21 November stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The data collected show there is some link between the socioeconomic context of the school and its rate of exclusion. Those most likely to be excluded are the children of families under financial or emotional stress and pupils with low levels of literacy. However, it does not follow that schools in disadvantaged areas exclude many pupils. Where there is good provision and especially, good teaching, there is less likely to be poor discipline, whatever the socio-economic context."</p></blockquote>
I should think that all Committee members agree about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the statistics available appear to show—although this point should be made with caution, as such statistics require careful interpretation—that the rate of exclusions in allegedly deprived Hackney, which is Labour controlled, is lower than that in the leafy suburbs of Kingston upon Thames, which was until recently Conservative controlled. Ofsted's comments continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Perhaps the most important finding is that there is much that schools can do, within the present statutory framework, to promote better behaviour and avoid exclusion. Schools which exclude few pupils tend to be better at managing behaviour and particularly at:
	<br><blockquote><p>implementing an effective behaviour policy;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>applying suitable rewards and sanctions",</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
which will not, happily, include the corporal punishment advocated by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth and some of his more reactionary hon. Friends. I except the Minister, in his new, enlightened, mode from that comment. He has reinvented himself more times than David Bowie. Judging by his ties, the phase that he is in now is more florid than his Ziggy Stardust period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other items on Ofsted's list of aspects of managing behaviour were:
	<br><blockquote><p>"monitoring exclusions; providing pastoral support and, tailoring their curriculum to meet individual needs".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>523</span>
The report concludes that more could be done by schools and local education authorities. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schools' use of exclusion was sometimes draconian without being effective."</p></blockquote>
The key to success, it said, was
	<br><blockquote><p>"the tone and ethos set by senior management, and above all the head, whose task it is to strike the difficult balance between the needs of the school as an institution and the interests of the individual disruptive child."</p></blockquote>

The new clause would make it a much stronger requirement that schools develop and use disciplinary policies wisely. In this it supports clause 20, which explicitly requires schools to have such a policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for Walton for reading the circular and guidance to the Committee to such approval. Therein lies the fairly narrow difference between us: whereas the hon. Gentleman has persuaded himself that it is right to limit the judgement of head teachers, as the new clause proposes, I take the opposite view. Setting out the objective, which we all share, that exclusions be a last resort is as far as one need go with the guidance. After that it can be left to the judgement of head teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me illustrate the point. I can envisage circumstances in which exclusion might be right and reasonable. Let us suppose a serious offence—assault by one pupil on another or on a member of staff, or drug dealing—was committed at a school. It would be completely justifiable for the head teacher to move directly to exclusion without necessarily going through the procedures prescribed in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The risk is that if we accepted a proposal such as this, we would then in a real sense tie the hands of head teachers in such a way that their job could be made more difficult—in some circumstances. I do not claim that this would be widespread, but a pupil's extreme behaviour might occur so frequently that it would be disadvantageous to tie the head teacher's hands over the implementation of the school's discipline policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point to which we are drawing attention was not that guidance does not have its place. It does, but we have to point to what ought to be received wisdom in schools—the fact that exclusion is the final sanction. That does not always get through. With your forbearance, Mr. O'Hara, I quote again from the Ofsted report. Paragraph 80 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some schools visited for the survey were so anxious to aviod exclusion that they incurred some dangers to themselves as institutions, to staff and pupils; others were too ready to exclude. A few were irresponsibly profligate in the use made of exclusion, devaluing it as a sanction".</p></blockquote>
I accept that there is a spectrum of attitudes towards exclusion. The simple purpose of new clause 13 is to make irrevocable schools' understanding that exclusion is the final sanction and is not to be used lightly, especially given the huge exponential number of exclusions—of which the Minister is acutely aware and which I believe is well above 13,000 a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>524</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the second time that that figure has been used in Committee today. As I said earlier to the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South, the figure sounds high if it is said over and over again. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris) was here, if not the hon. Member for Devonport, when I said that if one puts it in the context of 23,000 or 24,000 schools it does not sound so many. If the 8,000 or so exclusions from secondary schools are divided among the 3,500 secondary schools, it amounts to only two or three exclusions per annum per school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may differ on the relevance of the global figure, but that Ofsted report states that although some excluded children were intractable,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many…were actually in the end found to be manageable".</p></blockquote>
However, the key statement in the report reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The rise in exclusions continues nationally, but it is neither ineluctable, nor irreversible".</p></blockquote>
There is a huge rise in the number of exclusions. We may argue about its relative size—relative, that is, to the number of schools. It is still a major problem, but I know that the Minister is acutely aware of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not denying that there is a problem. The rather narrow point that we are debating is whether to use a form of words in a potential statute that might risk putting unnecessary bureaucracy in the way of head teachers in difficult circumstances. To introduce such a risk is unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view is that the guidance issued by the Department, which the hon. Gentleman rather generously quoted, school inspections by Ofsted—again, the hon. Gentleman quoted from the Ofsted report—the fact that schools will have to make proper discipline plans and that local education authorities will themselves have to make back-up plans and will be inspected, all combine to give the head teacher, working with the governors, the right amount of discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Differences of interpretation appear from time to time, but I am rather surprised, given their pre-parliamentary experiences, that the hon. Members for Walton, for Yardley and for Devonport should table new clauses or amendments to limit the discretion available to head teachers on such a crucial subject. That is a rather interesting distinction between us. I want to leave head teachers with what I believe is a proper amount of discretion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the Minister with care. As someone who taught in an inner city school for 18 years, I know that there is an element of truth in what he says. The use of drugs was a good example; another is violence. To set standards among children, teachers have to be seen to act immediately, sometimes on serious offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister accept that the problem posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Walton, which exercises us today, is the increase in the number of school exclusions? Although it is not, in itself, a massive number, the worry in the world of education is that the momentum continues and has not stopped or started on a downward trend. I do not have much
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0387">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>525</span>
evidence, but the feeling is expressed in schools that heads are now excluding pupils who would not have been excluded 10 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to frame a law that gives head teachers the message that we do not want that to happen, but leaves them with the discretion that they need to deal with serious offences. I take the Minister's point about having occasionally to act immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister responds, I have to say that interventions are increasingly lengthy. I try through body language to show that my patience is being tried. I must ask members of the Committee to be brief in their interventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, Mr. O'Hara, that intervention was particularly knowledgeable and useful. I accept what the hon. Member for Yardley said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other way to deal with the problem—one that we all recognise—is through the multiples approach, which we discussed this morning. I would rather come at the problem from that direction, given all the factors that I have described. I would rather allow head teachers to base their decisions on their knowledge of the particular circumstances and their judgment of the need to act quickly—perhaps very quickly in some cases—and with the possibility of a financial penalty being attached. They should make their judgment in the light of their knowledge rather than being unduly directed or prescribed by statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the line that I wish to draw and I believe that the new clause, well understanding its motivation as I do, steps over it. It would risk—I put it no higher than that—unnecessarily limiting the discretion of head teachers. It is for that reason that I ask the Committee to resist the new clause, not because we do not share the same motivation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee, and the Minister in particular, of what we propose to put into the Bill. The new clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The articles of government for every maintained school, grant-maintained school, maintained special and non-maintained special school shall provide that no pupil shall be permanently excluded unless…all reasonable steps have been taken by the school to avoid excluding the pupil".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman, being a reasonable man, may take that as read and understood. Allegedly, however, that is not the case in some schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause goes on to say that no pupil should be excluded unless
	<br><blockquote><p>"allowing the pupil to continue to attend the school would be seriously detrimental to the education or welfare of the pupil, other pupils or staff at the school".</p></blockquote>
We have no argument with that, and I do not understand how it would hinder the flexibility of a head teacher to take the appropriate measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us suppose that the proposal were in place and the head teacher was faced with a sudden incidence of violence or discovered that a pupil had been dealing in drugs. What would the hon. Gentleman regard as a reasonable step to take to avoid excluding a pupil in such circumstances, even if it is a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>526</span>
rather extreme case? I foresee such a difficulty. One might have to start asking the head rather difficult questions, such as, "Hold on a minute, you seem to have gone straight to a permanent exclusion to deal with that difficult case. What reasonable steps did you take to avoid excluding the pupil?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the extreme examples of, say, violence and drug taking, everyone would accept that it was entirely reasonable for children to be excluded. However, where the new clause would pertain and where the head would have to take reasonable steps, acting on behalf of the governing body, would be in the instance postulated by the hon. Member for Dover. He talked about clothing standards for staff. If that proposal were extended to school uniform rules, should children be excluded for not meeting such standards? There is evidence that people have committed minor misdemeanours in connection with say school uniform, but have been excluded for underlying reasons. That is an instance where reasonable steps need to be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that not exactly what the appeals mechanism is there to deal with? We have attempted, in the existing provisions and now in some of the Bill's provisions regarding exclusions and appeals, the rights of schools and the rights of parents, to get the difficult balance about right. The more one intervenes with more layers of regulations and rules, the greater the danger of disturbing that rather tricky balance. I prefer to rely on the judgment of the head teacher, the role of governors and the appeals mechanism that would be in place to catch the sort of issues to which the hon. Gentleman refers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We disagree with that in a sense. All that we are asking is that the articles of government are set out in such a way that there could be no misunderstanding about the expectation in a given school. The Minister queried our figure, but rather than 13,000 I prefer the figure of 13,429, which was the actual figure arrived at in the study commissioned by the Commission for Racial Equality and undertaken by Canterbury Christ Church college. It pointed out the large amounts of money that were being wasted on exclusion. However, that is a matter for debate on another day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that our intention in tabling the new clause was to make the Government appreciate the importance of taking every practical step possible to ensure that the small minority of schools, which might be a little cavalier about exclusion, understand that it is a sanction of last resort, not one of first resort.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 200, in page 24, line 8, leave out from 'or to end of line 13 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(a) a child who has been permanently excluded from two or more schools during the period of two years beginning with the date on which the latest of those exclusions took effect; or</p></blockquote>

	<br><blockquote><p>(a) the relevant standard number; or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) the admission number fixed in accordance with section 416 below.'.</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
I shall briefly move the amendment. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I hope that its substance meets with the same approval as does the brevity with which I intend to move it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that 13,429 exclusions was not many; it does not seem many compared to the 7 million children in school. However, in my constituency, the 29 excluded pupils must be roaming the streets. When they are roaming the streets and hanging around schools after hours waiting for other pupils and when they are going round the streets like bands of marauding mediaeval brigands, they take up a disproportionate amount of people's effort and time and have an enormous effect on the other children. The Minister may say that there are not many such children. I agree, there are not, but the effect that they have on their local communities can be extremely damaging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, of course, is why we want in the Bill to provide for local education authorities to have a proper, structured, well-thought-out, publicly understood plan to deal with pupils not in school, so that we can deal once and for all with the problem caused when people are not in school, we do not know where they are and we are not dealing with or educating them properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>528</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and I am sure that the Minister would add to that problem the crime that such young people commit, which is severely disproportionate to their numbers. In all these matters, we should be considering children who are well-behaved, who have good parents and who want to get on with their work, and ensuring that those children who are not well behaved and those parents who are not supporting the school do not have that disproportionate effect on the establishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is part of a small package of amendments designed to clarify and strengthen the Bill in relation to exclusions from school. It would end the largely illusory right of parents to choose a school for their excluded child after only one permanent exclusion—rather than after two—where the LEA considers that the exercise of that right would prejudice the efficient provision of education. That would effectively give the LEA power to step in earlier in hard cases, using its power under section 411(2) of the 1996 Act to place a child in a school irrespective of the availability of places—that is, making the best choice for the child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would do two things. First, it would recast clause 28(1) to avoid the use of the phrase "disqualified person". We think that branding a child as a disqualified person is unhelpful; we are backed in that belief by a large number of children's organisations, which think that the term "disqualified person" imposes an unnecessary stigma. We do not want to change the substance of this part of the Bill, but we think that it would be helpful if that phrase were lost; that would make no legal difference to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendment would create some discretion for a chief education officer to operate in the way envisaged in the 1996 Act when a child had been permanently excluded from only one school. The amendment has been drafted as it has become, while we do not believe that the right to express a preference should automatically be removed after only one exclusion, we recognise that the circumstances that in most cases arise after two exclusions may sometimes arise after one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some schools may, in the case of a child who is behaving and performing badly, persuade the parent to remove the child and place him or her in another school. In other words, it is effectively an exclusion by mutual agreement. That may benefit schools in that they would thereby avoid appearing on league tables as having a high number of exclusions; similarly, a school may decide that certain pupils do not fit in with its ethos and try to nudge them out by persuasion. There is not anything necessarily wrong with that, but if a child goes to a second school and is excluded, it would seem as though he or she has been excluded only once, whereas in reality, a prior exclusion had taken place by mutual consent between the parent and the school. That first exclusion should be taken into account. We believe that the amendment is helpful and I hope that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment will put some once-excluded pupils on a par with the twice-excluded pupil. Like the parents of the twice-excluded pupil, those of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>529</span>
such once-excluded pupils will lose their right to a place in their preferred school, although in their case, it will be because of the subjective judgment of the chief education officer. The Opposition are, therefore, effectively proposing that the CEO should have a broad discretion to remove the right of parents of once-excluded pupils to have a place in their preferred school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We considered carefully the loss of that parental right. In concluding that it should be withdrawn for a two-year period in the case of pupils permanently excluded from two other schools, we judged that such pupils could justifiably be described as having a proven record of violent or disruptive behaviour. That is not the case with the once-excluded pupil, whose exclusion may simply have been the result of, for example, his having reacted badly to a temporary emotional upset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have built in safeguards even in the case of twice-excluded pupils. We have set a time limit of two years from the period of the second or any subsequent exclusion on the suspension of parents' admission rights. The CEO's power to suspend parents' admission rights will be open-ended, however, since the amendment imposes no time limit on the period over which the CEO has the power to disapply the duty to admit. That means that the CEO could decide to suspend parental rights in the case of a pupil who had been excluded from a primary school and who is seeking a place in the sixth form of a secondary school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An attempt appears to have been made to apply some safeguards—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being too literal. The amendment gives CEOs discretion to examine the circumstances in which a child is removed from a first school into a second. Where such an exclusion does not occur through seriously bad behaviour, the CEO would have the discretion to ignore it; where there has clearly been a breakdown in discipline, however, or where a school frequently uses such removal as a ploy to avoid exclusions—doing things on an informal basis—the amendment would give the CEO the appropriate discretion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Undoubtedly, but I am rather nervous of giving CEOs that degree of discretion and that power to intervene in parental or pupils' rights. The point I made was not frivolous; no time limit is provided in the amendment, so a pupil who had been excluded once from a primary school could in theory—and doubtless at the CEO's excellent discretion—be denied a sixth-form place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that his comment was not frivolous; I know that he is not given to frivolity in such matters, but he gave the clear impression that he would not trust CEOs. Would he expand on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You bet, Mr. O'Hara! I do not see why we should give any individual in that capacity, no matter how elevated or senior, the sort of power suggested. Secretaries of State are given such powers by statute from time to time, but they are reluctant to use them. Panoplies of advice are available to them
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>530</span>
and the powers are subject to judicial review, which can go one way or the other. I would be very reluctant to give the suggested degree of discretion to chief education officers, which would be taken only if there were an overwhelming reason to do so. The hon. Member for Devonport has not made an overwhelming case for giving chief education officers an absolute, unfettered power in these cases which would not be time limited or trammelled in any other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An attempt to apply some safeguards appears to have been made, and it seems that the CEO would be expected to show that the once-excluded pupil's admission would prejudice efficient education at a particular school, although it is not clear whether the parent would have the right of appeal against the CEO's decision. The amendment would allow the CEO to cite prejudice as a ground for refusal in such cases, even when the grounds for the pupil's exclusion from a previous school were not a relevant factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal would also confer on the CEO a power to disapply the duty to admit on the governing bodies of voluntary aided and special agreement schools when he or she considered that a pupil's admission would be prejudicial to such a school. Currently, an LEA has little to say on the admission arrangements for those particular schools and it is left to their governing bodies to determine whether a pupil's admission would give rise to prejudice. In that sense, the amendment threatens to undermine the role of the governing bodies of that category of school. I am not sure whether that was the intention of the hon. Member for Devonport. My notes state that there are further, technical flaws in the amendment, but I will not weary the Committee or the hon. Gentleman with them. I rest my case on the anomalies that the amendment would create and on the unnecessary powers that it would give to CEOs. The case for the amendment has not been made and I ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister cannot accept the amendment, which would have been helpful. He said that I had not made the case for it. I suppose that I could have spent another half hour doing so, but it would further weary the Committee if I spent more than a moment on it now.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important and helpful amendment which would prevent a permanent exclusion commencing from a date determined by the head teacher without the parent having been informed immediately. We want an assurance that there is not a small but important gap in the Bill. Clause 28 deals with what happens when a child is excluded twice and provides for that procedure to be inserted in the 1996 Act. In those circumstances, under subsection (7) permanent exclusion shall be regarded as having taken effect on

the school day from which the head teacher decided that the child should be permanently excluded. The amendment would mean that there was absolute clarity about the date. In an earlier debate, the Minister said that lawyers could be involved in defining the precise definition of "reasonable". I can envisage cases in which parents feel aggrieved that there is discussion and argument about the precise day on which a child has been excluded from a school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a debate earlier about the use of pupil post. The Minister said that in some circumstances that could be deemed to be a proper way of informing a parent, but some clever barrister could argue that pupil post had not provided the parents with the information that they needed on the precise date, as it arrived two days later when Mum found a crumpled letter in the child's blazer pocket. Even if the Royal Mail was used, the letter could take one or two days to arrive. The parents could thereby deem that they had not received the information on the precise day required. The purpose of the amendment is simply to avoid ambiguity and any difficulties that could arise later for head teachers and governors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 157(2) of the Education Act 1996 requires head teachers to take reasonable steps to ensure that parents are informed without delay of any decision to exclude their child. That is amplified in my Department's circular 10/94, which recommends that that should, if possible, take place on the day of exclusion. I see no reason why any school would wish to delay informing parents of a decision to exclude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, however, is academic. I think that a misunderstanding exists about the date from which exclusion takes effect. It is not the date on which the head teacher takes the decision to exclude, but that on which exclusion starts. For example, if the head teacher takes such a decision on the last day of term, exclusion will take effect from the first day of the following term. The two-year disqualification would run from the latter date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is, therefore, unnecesary. It would make the proposed section 411A(7) ambiguous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify one simple point? if a head teacher excluded a child at 3 pm on a Monday, and the parent did not receive the information until 24 hours later, when would the exclusion have begun?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that it would run from the time at which the head teacher deemed it to have commenced. It is dependent not on the receipt of notification but on the point at which the head teacher determines exclusion to have started. That takes us back into territory that we have already covered. The position is clear. There is a danger that the hon. Gentleman's amendment would have a reverse effect. I hope that he will accept what I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>SCHEDULE INSERTED AFTER SCHEDULE 33 TO THE EDUCATION ACT 1996</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 196, in page 61, line 38, after "authority", insert "the head teacher".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 197, in page 61, line 40, after second "authority", insert "the head teacher".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport, I shall be brief and to the point. The amendment is simple. It deals with the situation in which a pupil has been excluded twice or more where the local education authority decides that that pupil should be admitted to a school at which the governing body lodges an appeal against that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The governing body and the head teacher—who will be a member of the governing body—will also be in agreement on that appeal. The governing body will make representations, which may be made by the head teacher in person, or by another member of the governing body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If everyone agrees with an appeal, that is fine. But in some cases, the head teacher may have a different point of view. Head teachers should be allowed to offer a different opinion, both in writing and in person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From another perspective, the appeal committee may want to put questions directly to the head. If the governing body had sent someone else, that might not be possible. The amendment allows the head to attend together with, if the governing body deems it appropriate, another member of the governing body, so that the heads have the right to put their views in person and appeal committees can ask questions of them about what will be a contentious and difficult decision. Ultimately, it would be the head and staff of the school who would have to take account of the appeal committee's final decision; if it is decided that the child will attend the school, they will have to make provision for him or her. The amendment is sensible and simple, and we hope that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I reply to the hon. Gentleman, I should note that the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) has been particularly quiet today—I know that that is because she has lost her voice. Despite the disturbance over an earlier group of amendments, I am sure that, in the spirit of Christmas, the whole Committee would like to wish her a speedy recovery—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0391">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>533</span>
we hope that she gets her voice back soon. I notice some dissent among Front-Bench Opposition members of the Committee, but perhaps that relates to something else—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] No, I confirm that there is dissent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 4 puts in place a mechanism for resolving locally disagreements between LEAs and governing bodies of county and controlled schools for which the LEA is the admission authority about LEA decisions to admit pupils who have been excluded from two other schools—the latter exclusion having occurred within the previous two years. Normally, the governing body of such a school would be under a duty to implement the LEA's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would require appeal committees to allow oral and written representations by head teachers in addition to those from the LEA and school governing bodies. I am surprised that the hon. Member for Attercliffe believes that such a specific provision is necessary. Where a governing body considers that it would not be appropriate to take a twice-excluded pupil, I think it highly unlikely that the head teacher would take the contrary view—indeed, I think that the hon. Gentleman acknowledged that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that, although it might be unlikely, it is possible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do accept that; if the hon. Gentleman will let me develop my argument, I hope that I shall be able to set his mind at rest by explaining that there are already mechanisms that will allow that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, of course, conceded that head teachers should be allowed to make representations to exclusion appeal committees. That seems only right, as the head will have taken the original decision to exclude the pupil concerned. There is no such justification, however, in the case of appeals against an LEA's decision to admit a twice-excluded pupil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>534</span>
I should perhaps add that the instrument of government for county and controlled schools already provides for head teachers to act as ex officio members of their school's governing body. There is nothing to prevent a head teacher-governor from attending the appeal hearing as the nominated governor, or otherwise to represent the governing body at the appeal hearing under paragraph 7(c) of the schedule. The appeal committee could, of course, always decide to take evidence from the head teacher on his or her own account; although I find it hard to imagine circumstances in which that would be necessary, it would be possible. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will accept that the amendments are unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Minister, but I am still not absolutely convinced that the head teacher has a right in all circumstances to attend, especially if the governing body decides not to send the head as its representative to the appeal. There may be cases in which the governing body does not send the head but the head wants to go, and our amendment would give the head the right to attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested that the Minister believed that the schedule would allow the head to attend the appeal committee even if the head was not the nominated representative of the governing body. It is important that the appeal committee can take all the evidence that it believes appropriate. Given that assurance at least, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
