Draft Driving Standards Agency Trading Fund Order 1997</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. John Bowls)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Driving Standards Agency Trading Fund Order 1997.</p></blockquote>
The principal task of the Driving Standards Agency is to conduct driving tests for cars, motor cycles, lorries and buses, and includes responsibility for both practical and theory tests. Its other statutory duties include control of the Register of Approved Driving Instructors and the supervision of compulsory basic training for motor cyclists.<br><br>
The DSA was established as an executive agency of the Department of Transport in April 1990. Although it is currently required to recover all its operating costs from fees and other income, its direct cash expenditure and fee receipts are subject to parliamentary vote. The agency's current expenditure is not cash limited, allowing additional vote provision to be sought when demand for its services increase. However, funding for capital investment must be provided from the Department's cash-limited vote.<br><br>
As a demand-led, self-financing body, the operations of the agency are ideally suited to a trading fund regime. Establishment of the trading fund would involve only modest changes from the current financial structure, mainly in relation to cash management and capital expenditure. Capital funds would be provided directly from feepayers rather than the Department of Transport's administration vote. Thus investment in test centre facilities, booking operations and management systems would be related to customer demands and the requirements of the business.<br><br>
As a trading fund, the agency's management will be able to work to a longer-term horizon, leading to more cost-effective use of resources, with the agency able to spend money now to provide benefits in future years. The potential for increased efficiency will enable us to set the agency a pricing formula which provides a challenging but realistic target. The formula will restrict the amount of future fee increases in the initial three-year period to no more than the rise in the retail prices index and thereafter fees will fall in real terms by 1 per cent. a year.<br><br>
Under trading fund arrangements, the chief executive will continue to be accountable for the management of the agency to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport. The agency's annual report and accounts will continue to be laid before the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
House. Assets remain vested in my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport and the agency's employees remain civil servants.<br><br>
Under the provisions of the Government Trading Funds Act 1973, a consultation paper on the proposals contained in the order was issued to individuals and organisations interested in driver testing and road safety issues. My right hon. Friend has, in accordance with the Act, laid before Parliament a report on the results of that consultation. The responses received raised no major issues of concern and were generally supportive of the proposal.<br><br>
The Committee should be aware of the financial commitment that the approval of this order entails. Under current arrangements, payments received by the agency are surrendered to the Consolidated Fund and the agency holds little cash itself. As driving tests are paid for in advance at the start of trading, the fund would have a liability to provide services with no corresponding cash to pay suppliers, salaries and so on. The Treasury has agreed that, subject to the approval of the Committee, a sum of £7 million, representing the amount of fees paid in advance, shall be paid into the agency's bank account with my hon. Friend the Paymaster General prior to establishment of the trading fund on 1 April. Parliamentary approval of that payment will be sought in the 1997–98 main estimates for the Department of Transport vote. Pending that approval, the sum will be met by a repayable advance from the Contingencies Fund. The principal of that call on the Contingencies Fund over a potential election period has been agreed with the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) and was announced in my written answer to my right hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Sir J. Cope).<br><br>
We intend that the agency will continue its excellent contribution towards road safety and will monitor its performance to ensure that standards are maintained. I should like to make it clear that the agency will continue to operate within set parameters and in accordance with customer service standards set by Ministers. I am sure that better value for money can be achieved under trading fund arrangements, which will benefit both staff and customers. Customers in particular will benefit from the additional efficiencies being passed on with lower fees in real terms.<br><br>
I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.35 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley: <span class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his succinct explanation of the order. As a result, I shall not unduly delay the Committee.<br><br>
The draft order was put out for consultation, and the small number of responses that were received were generally supportive. There is no need to go through the points in detail. I shall briefly discuss three concerns that were raised in those responses. First, the Minister made it clear that the agency would work within its current parameters. Organisations that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0323">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
represent driving instructors were worried about whether the agency's activities would extend into the training of drivers and instructors. What are the Minister's views on that potential extension of activities? Will the agency stick to the same parameters? Will the Minister discourage the agency from pursuing that extension?<br><br>
Secondly, concern was expressed about the overall financial arrangements and pressure on finance of a trading organisation, which could lead to a reduction in the number of offices around the country. In my constituency—Manchester, Withington—rationalisation of the service resulted in the number of offices being reduced by one. I do not necessarily argue that that led to a reduction in the service offered to the public, but that could be one consequence of financial pressures. Will the current level of office distribution around the country be maintained? Organisations including Learn and Live expressed concern about whether there would be pressure to reduce the agency's educational role of instructing people about road safety. That side of its work should not be diminished because of financial pressures. Will the Minister give an assurance that the Department will ensure that the present level of education on road safety is maintained—or enhanced—in the future? The Whitley council expressed concern on behalf of trade unions about the possible effects on employees if there were financial pressures on the agency.<br><br>
The matter links to my third concern, which is that the draft order may be a step towards the service's privatisation. The Minister made it clear that under the current arrangements the staff would remain civil servants and would maintain their pay and conditions under that umbrella. Will he give an assurance that there is no intention to move towards the privatisation of the whole service, which might involve staff being transferred from civil servant status to a privatised status?<br><br>
The Minister rightly said that he had been corresponding with my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East about the Consolidated Fund Bill, and that agreement had been reached to ensure that £7 million would be available to enable the effective transfer of the liabilities that would be in place on 1 April. We support that measure to ensure that the transition is effective.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
In general, we support the draft order. With those few questions to the Minister, I shall not delay the Committee further.</span></p>
<p>4.40 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can briefly reassure the hon. Gentleman about the points that he raised. Yes, the parameters will remain the same. The question of the training of drivers stems from the option for those who wish it to have a mock test as part of their instruction. However, there is no intention that the DSA should provide the training of drivers. That is a concern that we have set at rest and we are happy to do so again today.<br><br>
As for the number of offices, the agency has a duty to provide a network of test centres across the country within a reasonable travelling distance and the parameters for that are laid down and are complied with as closely as possible. That will continue.<br><br>
The DSA, the Department of Transport and its Ministers give priority to road safety. That will continue and we should not forget that the agency remains answerable to the Secretary of State and, through him, to Parliament, for the work carried out. That priority will remain.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that he wished to ask me three questions but I think that he asked a fourth, relating to employees. That is not a privatisation issue: there is no intention to move towards privatisation. Employees will remain as civil servants and have the same rights as any other civil servants within the agency's overall planning.<br><br>
I hope that with those words of reassurance, I have satisfied the hon. Gentleman, the hon. Member for West Lancashire (Mr. Pickthall) and my distinguished right hon. and hon. Friends.</span></p>
