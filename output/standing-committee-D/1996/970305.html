Draft The Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre Trading Fund Order 1997</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Sir Paul Beresford)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft The Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre Trading Fund Order 1997.</p></blockquote>
If approved, the order will establish the Queen Elizabeth II conference cente as a trading fund under the Government Trading Funds Act 1973. The Queen Elizabeth II conference centre currently operates as a next steps executive agency within the Department of the Environment. The agency aims to achieve best value for money in operating and marketing the centre as a high-quality, secure facility for national and international conferences and events. The agency operates on a commercial basis for use by Government and private sector customers alike.<br><br>
In 1995, the management of the centre was market tested and a five-year service level agreement was awarded to the in-house team with effect from April 1996. The proposal to move to trading fund status was included as part of the bid by the successful team. It saw the trading fund status as enabling significantly improved financial performance at the centre.<br><br>
At present, the agency is run on a net running costs regime with annual allocations made from the Department's administration vote. The agency has in recent years achieved significant improvements in its performance. Last year, for the first time, it achieved an operating surplus excluding rent and this year expects to do even better with an operating surplus excluding rent of £1,110,000.<br><br>
Nevertheless, for commercial organisations such as the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre, the outputs of which are financed from receipts that vary in line with demand, normal Government vote financing arrangements can often inhibit effective management. For example, if the demand for conferences is higher than expected at the start of the year, the centre's costs in providing for that demand will also be higher. Even though those higher costs will be covered by higher receipts, the constraints of vote accounting limit the management's flexibility in responding to such market opportunities.<br><br>
Under trading fund status, commercial organisations have greater flexibility to respond quickly to market opportunities or competitive threats
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
and so maximise their profitability and minimise their net costs to the Exchequer. The aim is as far as possible to replace bureaucratic controls with commercial discipline. Trading fund status will enable the centre to operate off vote, meeting all outgoings from receipts; to borrow and create reserves within prescribed limits; to carry over agreed levels of cash balances from one year to the next; and to vire freely between capital and current expenditure within the strategic control framework established by Department of the Environment Ministers.<br><br>
The centre's market test bid suggested that over 10 years the cumulative operating surpluses, excluding rent, could be improved by £4.5 million—an improvement of about 25 per cent.—through operating as a trading fund. The centre expects to increase profits through increased turnover derived from investment, both in opportunities to develop new markets and in redesigning the internal layout to improve occupancy rates.<br><br>
The trading fund order establishes the fund, describes the operations that are to be financed by it, designates the responsible Minister as the source of issues to the fund by way of loans, sets out the assets and liabilities to be appropriated to the fund, specifies a 50:50 ratio of public dividend capital to debt and sets a limit of £2 million to the fund's permitted borrowing.<br><br>
One unusual feature of the order is that the building is not being appropriated to the fund, and the Department of the Environment will continue to be responsible for the payment of the rent, which is currently £6.4 million a year. That reflects the basis on which the market test was conducted.<br><br>
If the Committee approves the order, we propose to set a financial objective based on the undertakings contained in the service level agreement. That will specify the minimum projected cash sums to be handed over to the Consolidated Fund each year, which must in aggregate over five years amount to at least £6.491 million. However, consistent with its status as a trading fund, we propose to permit the centre a degree of end-year flexibility in individual years within strictly prescribed limits. The Treasury and the National Audit Office have agreed that the minimum payments made under the service level agreement will be seen as a form of charge for the occupancy of the building, thus contributing to the Government's objective of minimising the net cost of the centre to the Exchequer. Any sums earned in excess of the stipulated minimum will, unless required for retention in the business, be available for distribution as dividends on the centre's public dividend capital.<br><br>
The order implies no major changes in accountability. The agency chief executive will be the accounting officer for the fund. He will continue to seek the Secretary of State's approval for his annual business and corporate plans, and to provide the Department with quarterly reports on performance.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0398">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
The Secretary of State continues to have the right to set revised targets at his discretion.<br><br>
The chief executive has consulted all the staff at the centre about the proposed move to trading fund status, and they support it. The National Audit Office has also been consulted on the form of the Treasury's proposed accounts direction and has said that it is content in principle with the proposed approach.<br><br>
During the debates on the Government Trading Act 1990, Treasury Ministers made it clear that they would advise the House, when proposing to set up a new trading fund, whether it was the Government's intention to privatise it at some future date. It may be helpful to the Committee if I emphasise that the Government have no plans to privatise the centre, which would almost certainly involve the sale of the building itself. In this particular case, the Government concluded that subjecting the management of the centre to a market test was the best way of minimising the costs of maintaining and running the centre.<br><br>
I commend the order to the Committee as it will put in place a financial regime that will enable the agency to make further significant improvements to its financial performance.</span></p>
<p>4.36 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hilary Armstrong <span class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Durham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving us such a full explanation. I had one or two questions that he has already answered in his introduction.<br><br>
Given that the proposal is part of the market-testing application from the in-house management, what will happen if the management fails to meet its targets? What regime would then come into play? How would the Department, the Treasury and, therefore, the Government deal with that situation—particularly given that the centre's management, not the asset or building, is becoming the trading operation?<br><br>
I also wonder whether the Government are looking to the current proposal as a way of handling other market-tested operations and whether it has long-term implications for organisations such as local government. How do the Government see matters proceeding?<br><br>
We have not yet seen the annual report to which the Minister referred—it is not in the public domain. It said, however, that the market-tested management had moved into surplus. One of my questions was going to be whether the Government were satisfied that the targets that are being set are being met. In previous years, the centre has not managed to meet the range of targets set for it. I would be interested to know whether it had managed to meet its targets in 1995–96 and what the signs are for this year.<br><br>
The centre is clearly important internationally and nationally. I am interested to see that it has been working closely with London First and other cross-London pressure groups, which are arguing for a cross-London authority. Perhaps the Queen Elizabeth II centre could have a part to play if that comes to pass. I shall not oppose the order, but it is important to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
have some idea of how the implications of the order will be treated by the Government.</span></p>
<p>4.39 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Key <span class='memberconstituency'>(Salisbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this modest and rather timid step. I am surprised and rather disappointed that privatisation has been ruled out by the Department of the Environment. I should like to ask my hon. Friend the Minister whether the conference centre that is currently occupied by the International Maritime Organisation and supported by the taxpayer, has or will have the same trading or legal status that the Queen Elizabeth II centre will have if the order is passed.<br><br>
When we saw the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre being built, we wondered whether it would be a success. I am glad to acknowledge that it is. If taxpayers own those buildings, it is important that they are informed about their exact status. Competition between the two conference centres in London is important to London First, to the future of our capital city and to the Treasury and the taxpayer. I welcome the improvements but would be grateful if the Minister could allay my fears.</span></p>
<p>4.40 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pendle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The order is a strange half-way house whereby the Department of the Environment takes responsibility for the building and for the rent of £6.4 million, while the body running the Queen Elizabeth II centre is supposed to pay £6.491 million in lieu of paying rent. That means that around £91,000 will have to be found. If the organisation makes a big profit, how much of it can be retained by the chief executive and senior managers? If the Queen Elizabeth II centre becomes a rip-roaring success—it is only a stone's throw away from the Palace of Westminster—what is to stop the people running it from lining their own pockets and vastly inflating their salaries? I want an assurance from the Minister that that will not happen and that he will keep a tight rein on things.</span></p>
<p>4.42 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) refers back to my explanation at the beginning, he will see that there is a tight rein and that there will be an annual check on proceedings—part of the reason, I suspect he will agree, for the half-way status.<br><br>
I am afraid that I shall have to write to my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key) to answer his question, since I am not au fait with the other building that he mentioned. I shall try to provide him with all the details as soon as I can.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North-West Durham (Ms Armstrong) asked about the audited accounts. In 1995–96, the target profit was £3,000 and profit achieved was £902,000. She rightly asked what will happen if the current regime does not work out. As I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0399">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
said in my opening speech, I will be closely monitoring the agency's performance. If it should fall seriously short of the target set, consideration will be given to terminating the service level agreement. Ultimately, the Department could take it over and turn it back to its previous status.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
