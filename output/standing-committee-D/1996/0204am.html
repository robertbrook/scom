	<time>Tuesday 4 February 1997</time>
	<p>	<i>(Morning)</i></p>
	<p>[SIR ROGER SIMS 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Sex Offenders Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Timothy Kirkhope)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during proceedings on the Sex Offenders Bill the Committee do meet this day and Thursday 6th February at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
I shall not detain the Committee for long, Sir Roger. May I say how pleased I am to be in this Committee under your chairmanship. We are looking forward to a constructive Committee stage, dealing with important legislation. The Bill is an important step forward in the development of protection against paedophiles and other serious sex offenders. It has two basic objectives. First, it will place an obligation on those convicted of paedophile or other serious sex offences to notify the police of their movements, thus giving the police in each locality knowledge of the offenders living in their area. That will enable the police to keep tabs on the movement of offenders. The Bill is not primarily about the disclosure of information, although that is an aspect in which others take some interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene in my hon. Friend the Minister's speech so early in the debate. I listened carefully to what he said and noted his remarks about the Bill not being concerned primarily with disclosure. Will he explain how the Bill will work in practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are debating a sittings motion and I am allowing the Minister a little latitude in speaking to it. The details of the Bill will be discussed as we proceed in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Conwy (Sir W. Roberts) for his intervention. I hope to be able to give further details as we progress in Committee. I agree that it may be necessary for there to be some clear guidance or a code of practice in such matters, but I hope to deal with that in more detail later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Bill will give our courts jurisdiction over acts of child sex abuse committed overseas. It is the final link in the chain to outlaw the despicable practice of so-called child sex tourism. Such matters are important and we want to press ahead with them as quickly as possible. That is why I am proposing that the Committee sits this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the Minister's pleasure at your chairmanship of the Committee, Sir Roger. I know that the issue that we are about to discuss is one in which you have taken an
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
interest over the years. Indeed, in some ways it might be frustrating for you to have to adjudicate on our debates rather than taking part in them. It is always an advantage to a Committee to have a Chairman who is well informed on the subject matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Bill, as I did on Second Reading. It moves in a direction that the Opposition have been urging for some time. It was not outlined in the Gracious Speech, so it was the offer of co-operation by my right hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) that rescued the measure. That shows the nature of our support and the constructive contributions that we intend to make during the Committee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept the need to sit twice today because we share the Minister's wish to expedite the Bill in Committee. However, we also want to ensure that the Bill is properly scrutinised and that options for going slightly further than is currently proposed are fully explored. With that in mind, we have tabled a number of amendments—but I assure you, Sir Roger, and the Minister, that it is not our intention to delay the Committee. We wish to make our points, but we shall do so succinctly. We hope that the Minister may sometimes meet us halfway by making a positive response. He has been willing to listen, so we can always live in optimism, but we shall see what happens when we come to specific details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends will assist with the amendments that the Government have tabled to enhance and improve the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. I have read those amendments and some puzzle us, but we look forward to the Minister's explanation. Others are clearly drafting amendments to clarify the Bill. Some seem to go in a rather odd direction, but I am sure that the Minister will want to explain his intentions and persuade us of them. We shall certainly listen sympathetically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two elements in the Bill give us concern. First, the Bill does not establish a register or a system to keep the information that the Bill requires to be given to the police. Some of our amendments and new clauses deal with that. Secondly, although the matter of offences committed abroad was debated at some length on earlier measures, and although the Bill goes some way in the direction that we urged in a similar Committee last year, it does not yet go far enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be able to respond positively to some of our amendments. Above all, we must ensure that the Bill targets the people who need to be targeted and does not hit unintended victims by being imprecise or inappropriate in some of its elements. I am sure that the Minister shares that overall aim, and I am therefore sure that our debates will be constructive and fruitful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Thurnham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bolton, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to add my support to what has already been said in welcoming you, Sir Roger, as Chairman of our Committee. You are well known for your concern for matters to do with children, and generally with social services—issues which are so relevant to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I supported the main aims of the Bill on Second Reading. However, considerable improvements need to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0583">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
be made. On Second Reading, I described the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) as timid—not a word I use often—as I believe that there are shortcomings in some of the Bill's provisions. The Government have tabled amendments that, to some degree, strengthen the Bill, but further amendments are needed to deal with other issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to hold up the progress of the Committee. I welcome the decision to sit this afternoon. We may need also to sit on Thursday morning, but I hope that we shall be able to complete our proceedings in good time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Members for their kind personal remarks, despite which I shall endeavour to maintain the impartiality of the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during proceedings on the Sex Offenders Bill the Committee do meet this day and Thursday 6th February at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we proceed to the amendments, I remind the Committee that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>SEX OFFENDERS SUBJECT TO NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 8, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>", after the commencement of this Part".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p> No. 4, in page 1, line 16, leave out

	<br><blockquote><p>", at that commencement".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 6, in page 2, line 11, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>", at that commencement,".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with the matter of retrospectivity. At present, the Bill will affect only those who are convicted in future or who are currently serving a sentence or under supervision. That has surprised the members of the public to whom I have spoken and the police. Last month, I met representatives of the Greater Manchester Police Federation; they were surprised that the Bill would not be retrospective, given the well-known fact that people with paedophile tendencies can continue to offend until late in life—their behaviour does not necessarily improve unless they receive proper treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My general feeling about the Bill is that we should approach it from a commonsense point of view, which dictates that we need as good a source of information as possible. Where a known offender is currently residing at a given address, I see no reason why he should not be notified that he must tell the police if he changes
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
address. If the police already know where he is, it will not be a burden on them if the Bill requires that the change of address be notified—indeed, it would help them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that it would be difficult to notify every previous offender, whose whereabouts may not be known. I asked the Library to estimate how many people would be affected. In its note to me, it said that, on current figures for England and Wales—I do not have the figures for Scotland and Northern Ireland—it would affect 3,000 offenders per annum, plus a further 1,000 people who are cautioned. That is about 4,000 people each year, so if we went back 20 or more years the Bill could cover almost 100,000 people, including many tens of thousands of serious offenders—the Library thought that the figure would be in the upper tens of thousands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the police already know of someone who might be a risk, I do not see what the problem is in their notifying that person. As I see it, the difficulty with the Bill is that it will not allow the police to register someone who had previously offended. The police will have to keep a list of people who offend after the date of the Bill's commencement, but will not be allowed to put on that register the names and addresses of previous offenders. That seems to go against all common sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might claim that the police will be allowed to keep a list of previous offenders, but I do not understand how the register would enable them to find out who had offended if the names and addresses are not included. It seems that the police will have to keep a separate register, which would apply only to those people covered by the Bill; it would not include someone who is well known to the police at his current address. It does not make sense to impose that requirement on the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are already a large number of lists. The Minister of State has told me that the police already hold information on the Phoenix database and on microfiche records held by the national identification service. They may also retain information locally about alleged paedophiles. That does not make it clear exactly how the police would hold and handle that information—whether they would keep separate lists on paper or on computer and whether they would put that information into the Phoenix database.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the National Criminal Intelligence Service maintains a database of known or suspected paedophiles; the Department for Education and Employment keeps a list known as list 99; and the Department of Health has a list known as the consultancy index, which covers people who have been convicted of an offence and enables the department to notify employers of the names of persons who worked with children and were dismissed or resigned in circumstances in which a child's welfare was put at risk. In addition, voluntary bodies such as the Scout Association keep lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify how the Bill will affect local authorities? Local authorities often have more information than other bodies; they know where there is abuse within a household and may require that unless a member of that household leaves the house the children will be taken into care. There may not be a conviction,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
but local authorities know well where there are people who are more than vague suspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 64 of the document "Working Together"—a guide to arrangements under the Children Act 1989 for inter-agency co-operation for the protection of children from abuse—which was published in 1991, states that local authorities should not hold a list of such people. It seems confusing that local authorities have a legal duty—established in the case of Devon county council—to use the information that they have, but guidance from the Government tells them that they should not keep a list. I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify how local authorities should co-ordinate the use of their information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Virtually everyone who has made representations to me about the Bill has said that a common database is needed to hold all information relevant to paedophile offenders, both those who are convicted in criminal or civil courts and those who, for other reasons, are well known as suspects. There is a requirement for local authorities to keep a list of names and addresses of people who visit homes where children have been abused. Therefore, it is established that local authorities should keep information about suspects, but it is not clear how that information should be co-ordinated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public view is that, under the Bill, there will be a paedophile register, which will include all the information that is needed. In fact, the word "register" appears no where in the Bill. It is not obvious what will be done with the information supplied to the police. It would be most helpful if the Minister will clarify exactly how the information will be held and used and how the police can avoid having to keep several different lists in order to comply with the requirements of the Bill, under which they will not be allowed to put the names and addresses of previous offenders on to the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Government's consultation paper "Sentencing and Supervision of Sex Offenders", which was issued last June, there was a call for measures to provide better protection for the public. That protection is needed now. However, the Bill will not provide the protection that the public wants now. It might do so in decades to come, but for now it only nibbles at the problems—it is a mouse of a Bill given the large numbers of previously convicted offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Offenders' addresses might already be known to the police, so the Government's existing databases could be used to follow up such people. I am not clear how that is done. Presumably, by using national insurance numbers it is possible to know where people work or, if people draw benefit, to know where they do so. It is important to know how all such measures will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difficulty with the Government's view that such a requirement is a punishment. In his opening speech, the Minister said that these were draconian measures. I do not see them in that light. If people are still a risk to the public, they should be considered as people who require treatment—indeed, some people
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
might question whether they should be allowed out. If those people require treatment, the Bill should not be considered as draconian.

On the question of whether the Bill should be applied retrospectively, the Minister referred to the European Court of Human Rights. I understand that when ordinary civilians in most European countries move from one town to another—for example, from Dusseldorf to Berlin—they are required to register their change of address. That is normal in Europe; it is not seen as a draconian arrangement. It is common for civilians in many European countries to comply with such arrangements. This country is the exception—we do not have to register when we move from one town to another. It is a mistake for the Government to view this as a draconian measure; it should be seen as straightforward and in the interests of the offenders. I was pleased to hear the Minister say that the Government were not considering a Megan's law under which all the names would be pinned up on the door of the town hall. We must ensure that the information is used properly, not abused in any way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to encourage the hon. Gentleman not to go too far down that path. In his opening remarks, he made it clear that he thought that we should broaden the effect of the Bill to make it retrospective. That could be interpreted as being a draconian approach. He has suggested that the Government consider the measure as a punishment. I can assure him that the Government do not regard it as a punishment or as an extension of punishment. I shall go into further detail about that later, but it is absolutely clear that it is not a punishment. It is draconian—to use the term used by my right hon. Friend the Minister of State—because it is undoubtedly a major obligation, and concerns a sensitive matter. In that sense, it is draconian, but it is not an extension of the punishment per se—the Government have not said that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's remarks, and for his setting the matter in context. He will recall that on Second Reading, there were calls from hon. Members on both sides of the House for the Bill to apply retrospectively. The hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Mrs. Clwyd) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I believe that the register must be retrospective if it is to have any worth…There are all too many examples to show that, had there been a retrospective register of this kind in the past, many people would have been enabled to protect vulnerable children … Unless the register is retrospective, it will not identify people who have previous convictions and who are still in positions of responsibility, working with children."</p></blockquote>
In the words of the Minister of State, the primary purpose of the notification requirements
	<br><blockquote><p>"is to ensure that the information contained within the police national computer remains fully up to date."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 January 1997; Vol. 289, c. 54–5, 24.]</p></blockquote>
So it would be helpful if the notification requirements were made retrospective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will reconsider whether, where the police are already in contact with someone—where they know where the person lives, and where it is known that the person has been found guilty of serious offences in the past and could still be a risk—they should be allowed to say to that person, "If you move,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
you must tell us the address to which you move." In three or four years time, it will be frustrating for the police if they can require one person who was convicted four years previously to tell them when he changes address, but not another person who was convicted five years previously. That does not make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not regard the amendments as imposing a punishment, I regard them as strengthening the Bill, and I ask the Minister to consider them carefully. I do not intend to press the amendment to a Division, but I felt that that point should be made in view of the strong representations that have been made to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply, I would like to elaborate on what I said earlier. At the beginning of his remarks, the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) used the term "common sense". I do not suggest that he personally is lacking in common sense, but the amendments are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons for that are straightforward. If the amendments were accepted, we would have an unworkable piece of legislation. When we were formulating our proposals, we carefully considered whether we could apply the provisions to anyone who had ever been convicted of a relevant offence. We recognised that it would be virtually impossible to identify—and, more importantly, to locate—all those with a conviction for a relevant sexual offence. I presume that the hon. Gentleman would want those cautioned to be included. In most cases, we have no idea where those people are now living. A general search for such people would place an intolerable burden on the police, and would also be publicly unacceptable. We have tried to make the provisions practicable and realisable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One question that the hon. Gentleman has not answered is, if the amendments were accepted, for what period would people who were found, having been convicted many years ago, be required to register? There are a lot of people in society who have in years gone by—especially since the Sexual Offences Act 1956—been convicted of an offence that would now fall under schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are not practicable. Under the Bill's provisions, we are extending registration—as the hon. Gentleman said—to those who are still in contact with the criminal justice system or who are still in psychiatric hospital. Obviously, we shall then be able to notify the people involved of the requirement. After all, it is their basic right to be notified and it would be impossible if we did not know where they were.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clapham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Minister says and I am aware that retrospection presents a difficult problem. However, does he agree that there is a way forward? If someone had committed an offence that would have resulted in him being put on the register, and he is subsequently brought to court for another offence that may not be connected with the first offence, would not it be possible, when all the information is available to the court, for him to be listed at that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That proposal might be attractive were it not for the fact that we have a tight schedule of
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
offences for which registration is applicable. In effect, anyone who comes before the court for a further offence for which we believe registration is applicable, will have to be put on the register on conviction. That, coupled with the point that I made a moment ago to the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East about the registration term reflecting on the original offence or conviction, shows that the hon. Gentleman's proposal is not a possibility. If an offender came before the court for a completely different offence, it would hardly be right for him to be put on the register when the nature of that later offence was not included in the schedule. Similarly, we would not have any means by which registration would be applicable because the later offence might be 30 years on. Would we then say that the nature of that offence 30 years ago suggests that there should be registration under the schedule of seven years, 10 years or life? I do not think that that is either workable or sustainable either in legal argument or in the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Greenway 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ryedale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be best to ask my hon. Friend the Minister a direct question, rather than making a more formal intervention. There is a difficulty with retrospection, even if we agreed on a different cut-off date to the one of commencement—my hon. Friend the Minister made a valid point about how far back we should go. Attractive though retrospection may seem at first sight, I am concerned that all those who have been convicted of an offence listed in the schedule and who have been successfully treated for their offending behaviour will suddenly find that it is all revisited on them because they will now have to put their names on the register. Will my hon. Friend the Minister say what advice the Government have had on that matter? It would be unwise for the Committee to assume that because someone had committed an offence included in the schedule, that necessarily implies that he will be persistent and habitual in his behaviour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. We have debated and discussed carefully whether it was possible to operate retrospection. We felt that there were an enormous number of hurdles in the way, including, as my hon. Friend rightly said, the nature of any treatment undertaken by the offender or changes that might have occurred many years before. It is basically an accident whether such an offender comes to notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) raised an important point and I do not want to minimise the fact that people can be treated and then show that the risk of re-offending has been reduced to an acceptably low level. But what about other cases? I should like the Minister to respond to the following example. If someone is subject to a direction from a civil court to keep away from a certain house because the children who live there are at risk from him, why should he not have to notify his address to the police? He would not in any way come into the category that the hon. Member for Ryedale has just outlined. The police and the authorities are in contact with him—why should he not be required to notify his change of address? What sense would it make to look back in four
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0586">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
or five years time and say that he could not do so because he was convicted at an earlier date?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be tempted down a route on which there is a later amendment in the name of the hon. Gentleman and when we are discussing the more limited issue of retrospective action; I say to him simply that one of the problems I have with his argument is that of standard of proof, which I shall happily discuss later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall have to concentrate our minds on improving the Bill rather than on being extremely general if we are to make the progress that the Minister desires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are fatally flawed because they seek to make the requirements of the Bill retrospective without putting in place a judicial process for implementing that requirement. I have to say to the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East that they are untargeted, vague and ill thought out. However, I urge the Minister to consider how information about people who are a danger to children but who are not covered by the Bill is co-ordinated; we address that issue in some of our later amendments and new clauses. Suggestions such as that made by my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) are constructive because they recognise the problem and consider how it can be addressed. The amendments do not do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested by the point that the Minister made—I hope that I did not misunderstand it—in response to the important question of whether registration is regarded under the Bill as a part of punishment or as a measure of child protection. Once one has answered that, one enters an area of logic in trying to make child protection effective under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had made the point reasonably clearly, but I shall repeat it: we do not see the measure as a form of punishment, but as a necessary administrative function that offers protection to the public. That is the important factor; the Government are not saying that it is further punishment, because punishment is in the hands of the original court which determined the sentence that a person has had to serve in relation to the offences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that. He has clarified an area that could have been one of considerable debate. It is clear that we are dealing with a measure that deals with the protection of the public and of children. I shall take that as a starting point for our later debates. The fact that a decision is taken in law at the time of sentences is important because there can be no criticism of an extension of the punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to press the matter further, except to remind the Minister that he did not answer the points on how the register is to be compiled and whether the police would be allowed to put the information on the register, but perhaps he will do so later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 15, at end insert "; or
	<br><blockquote><p>(d) he is convicted of an offence in any country or territory outside the United Kingdom which would constitute a sexual offence to which this section applies if it had been done in the United Kingdom."</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with the issue of offences convicted abroad. Again, it was a great surprise to the public, who have learnt more about the Bill, and to the House when we debated it last Monday, to learn that people who are convicted abroad would not be included in the terms of the Bill. An Englishman convicted in France, therefore, of the most heinous paedophile offence would not be subject to any notification requirement. That seems to be a loophole and even a dangerous incentive, in today's world of such easy international travel, to offend abroad. When the Minister of State said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Those who may be convicted of offences overseas would not be required to register"—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 January 1997; Vol. 289, c. 29.],</p></blockquote>
there was a chorus from all sides of the House, which was recorded in 	<i>Hansard</i> of, "Why not?". He then contradicted himself by saying, first, that it was a recipe for disaster, but then that he might be tempted to consider the matter when the rest of the Bill was up and running.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the best place for prosecutions is the country in which the offences are committed. If a British tourist was accused of abusing children overseas, we would look to the authorities in the country concerned to prosecute him under their own laws."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say how part II of the Bill would be necessary only if, for some reason, extradition was impossible. In the light of that, we cannot reasonably maintain that it is dangerous for us to recognise foreign judgments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Mossley Hill (Mr. Alton) asked the Minister of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"to assure the House that those guilty of offences committed overseas against children will be included on the register".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government are likely to be informed about offences committed overseas because…most of the groundwork is performed by an international network of non-governmental organisations that would readily seek to protect children by providing the relevant evidence to the Government. Will the Government reconsider the matter, otherwise there will be a glaring loophole in the legislation?"—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 January 1997; Vol. 289, c. 27–33.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Members for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) and for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) made the same point. Furthermore, the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) asked the Minister to consider a provision for registration of offences abroad. There was a strong feeling throughout the House about the matter. The right hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Alison), the hon. Members for Cynon Valley, whom I have already quoted, and for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton), all said that the omission was an obvious mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a strong feeling that we should bring under the terms of the Bill those people who commit offences abroad. It is common sense that we should do so. Given
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
today's world, when we must consider matters in more global terms, it is inconceivable that someone who goes abroad to commit offences can do so in the knowledge that he will not be liable under the Bill. It makes common sense that a paedophile register should include people who are guilty of such offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State could hardly have said that he wants such cases taken through courts abroad if he was not confident that they would be dealt with properly. The names and addresses of those who commit offences abroad should be on the register. It seems that the police are again being asked to keep a multitude of registers containing different pieces of information because we do not have one overall register. The public want one register to enable there to be proper protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the police have certain information on their databases about people who have been convicted of offences abroad, but that information would not be available to social services departments, for example. Area child protection committees should be informed when someone who is known to be a serious risk is living in their community. If someone has been convicted of a string of offences abroad and comes to live in an area, that fact should be made known to the local committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why the Government consider that they should not include such a measure in the Bill. I am sorry to say this, because I doubt whether the Minister will like it, but, on occasions, the Government look as though they have been dragged through a hedge backwards. At the first conference when the issue of overseas offences was raised, the Government said that they could do nothing about it. It was not until the Under-Secretary spoke out so strongly in Stockholm that it was apparent that the Government had changed their mind. However, even if the Minister was not booed, he certainly received a cold reception at the previous conference when he said that he could do nothing about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right—I went to Stockholm last August and I spoke out strongly on the matter. Furthermore, not only did I speak out on behalf of this country, I presented to the conference a comprehensive document on how this country is concerned about the protection of children. It was well received. We were ahead of probably every other country when we issued our challenge that the other countries at the conference should also produce guidance setting out such a comprehensive approach. I have nothing to be ashamed of in my approach to the matter or that of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister on how he has approached his responsibilities. He may have been prepared to go further than his officials in saying that children's interests come first, and should certainly come before bureaucratic convenience and the niceties of British legislation compared with foreign law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has brought common sense to bear and enabled the Government to go thus far. I would press him to consider going further and not leave a most obvious loophole, for the bureaucratic inconvenience of not being able to say that it would be a straightforward matter. We should demand that it is done. I hope that
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
the Minister will properly reconsider the need to close that glaring loophole. I have said already that I do not intend to press the amendment to a Division. However, if we do not hear on Report that the Government intend to close that loophole, many right hon. and hon. Members will feel that there should be a Division on the issue in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that some very focused debates on later amendments are in danger of becoming confused because of the hon. Gentleman's speech. His aspirations are as vague as his amendments. That does not help us. Many members of the Committee, including the Minister, have debated these issues on various occasions, and we want to see targeted improvements to the Bill to bring about some of the beneficial results referred to by the hon. Gentleman. Frankly, I do not see how his amendment helps with that. It is vague. It suggests that any offence committed in any country outside the UK would
	<br><blockquote><p>"constitute a sexual offence to which this section applies".</p></blockquote>
That is so wide, and there is no indication of who would take the decision on which offences would apply. There is no discrimination, no targeting and no mechanism in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman knows that I have tabled some new clauses to provide a mechanism, as well as targeting those offences abroad that can be brought within the ambit of the Bill. I do not want a sensible debate on that subject to be undermined by the hon. Gentleman's extremely vague and generalised contribution. We have some targeted debates ahead of us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I welcome the hon. Gentleman's amendments and new clauses, which will enable us to consider the aspect in a more targeted fashion, but I cannot agree with him that my amendment is at all vague. It is quite precise in stating that any offences outside the UK would,
	<br><blockquote><p>"constitute a sexual offence to which this section applies as if it had been done in the United Kingdom."</p></blockquote>
I am grateful for the help that I received from official quarters in drafting my amendment. I am fully satisfied that it is sufficiently precise and that it cannot be described as vague or defective. I believe that it is valid. Although I do not intend to press it to a Division, I hope that the Government will give it every consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel as though we are taking part in a family argument this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should I say a wider family argument?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the amendments tabled by the Opposition do not have as much merit as amendment No. 2, even though it is, as the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth said, slightly woolly. I fully understand the principle being pursued by the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East. I have explained my position clearly—we do not want people abroad to get away with such offences. That is why we have such a complex and comprehensive approach to the problem. The Sexual Offences (Conspiracy and Incitement) Act 1996 deals with the organising of such trips.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0588">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
We have a positive approach to extradition. Very few countries will extradite their own nationals to stand trial elsewhere, but we do. Admittedly, only a small number are extradited, but it was in that context that I looked at the amendment to see whether we could make any progress. I said on Second Reading that we would carefully consider extraditable elements—that is, where there is dual criminality and some linkage. Unfortunately, one of the worst places for the offences is the Philippines, with which we do not have an extradition agreement, so the line it is suggested that we take would be flawed from the beginning. The absence of extradition agreements with many countries where the offences may be committed will not be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To place a requirement on someone as a result of a conviction in any overseas country and have it enforced through the sanction of a significant period of imprisonment carries with it an implication that we are satisfied about the criminal justice system of that other country. We would also need to rely on reports made from abroad, so it would be a somewhat hit-and-miss affair. People with convictions for such offences in overseas countries would no doubt want to challenge the basis of their convictions or challenge the information made available when they had been convicted. The amendment would require an unwieldy and expensive bureaucracy for very few convictions—admittedly for serious offences—because we do not know the exact and full details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East that we have arrangements with the National Criminal Intelligence Service and also through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to collect information on convictions abroad. When that information is available, it is passed back to the United Kingdom so that checks on previous convictions may be made. Where there are previous convictions, the information is provided for the arresting authorities overseas—we do what we can to help in such cases. An offender who is aware of any scheme under which he would be subject to notification for a relevant sexual offence would be unlikely to draw his case to the attention of our authorities, who would not know of it unless they found about it in some other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have problems with the amendment, although I am not totally unsympathetic to it. We are doing what we can in a number of other ways to deal with the extremely detestable people who go overseas to commit such offences. We cannot support the amendment, however, as I do not see any way forward under it that would be legally sustainable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many Conservative members of the Committee share the general concern behind the amendment, but feel that the overriding requirement, when we are so close to a general election, is to ensure that the Bill—with all the benefits that it will bring, both domestically and internationally—is on the statute book.

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 15, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>";Or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(d) he has been found in a civil court, an industrial tribunal or a disciplinary hearing, to have done anything which, in the opinion of a chief officer of police, would have constituted a sexual offence to which this Part applies if it had been tried in a criminal court."</p></blockquote>
This amendment deals with people who, although they have not been found guilty in a criminal court, may have been found guilty in a civil court, industrial tribunal or disciplinary hearing—there may be other ways in which it has been made pretty clear that they are guilty—but will not be covered by the Bill because of its current wording. I believe that there is an urgent need to deal with known sex offenders who have not been convicted and therefore will not be covered by the Bill as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole purpose of the Bill is to deal with risks to the public and the dangers inherent in allowing people to remain in the community who continue to pose a risk. The Bill is not meant as a punishment; I am glad that the Minister said that it is not draconian in that sense. We should consider it in the context of the proposals under the Police Bill for an enhanced criminal record certificate to supply relevant non-conviction information. It should also be considered in the light of the current law under which local authorities have a duty to maintain surveillance of those suspected of child abuse if they consider that there is a risk to children. We all know the difficulties of making children give evidence in criminal cases—sometimes against their own fathers or stepfathers—given all the requirements of a criminal prosecution. That has been referred to by many people as secondary abuse of children who have already suffered enough. On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That is why, even when there is an overwhelming case against a sex offender, the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and social services feel compelled—even before the parents intervene—to abandon proceedings."</p></blockquote>
Hence we know that only 5 or 10 per cent. of paedophile cases reach court. In those circumstances, child protection agencies often have to fall back on the use of the civil courts to protect children, which means that the majority of offenders are never held to account, monitored or treated. We should give the police powers to keep track of such people, who are well known to the police. Where there is contact through the courts, the practical issues to which the Minister referred earlier do not apply. There is every opportunity to tell such people that they must inform the police of a change of address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police are especially concerned about the well-known tendency of paedophiles to prey on single mothers in areas where they believe they are unknown to the local police. It does not make any sense for the Minister of State to say, as he did on Second
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Reading, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"if police and their local intelligence systems have information on individuals, they will maintain that information."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 January 1997; Vol. 289. c. 37–57.]</p></blockquote>
How can the right hon. Gentleman say that, if we are not to give the police the power to maintain that information? There must be clarity about how the information will be handled. At present, we have a series of unco-ordinated, contradictory and conflicting guidelines for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already quoted from the document, "Working Together"—the Minister has not replied to this point—in which local authorities were told that a list of such people should not be held. I find it strange that the Government can issue a document calling on local authorities not to hold lists of such people when they expect the police to maintain lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already cited the case of R. 	<i>v.</i> Devon County Council ex parte L, in which it was held that local authorities have a duty to maintain surveillance of suspected sex offenders. Sadly, there are many thousands of people who are a risk to the public and whom the police already feel under some duty to track, but the Bill totally ignores them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police and the public expect the Bill to provide for a proper register that is of use to the police. We all agree that there are difficulties with some suspect information. For example, it is known that in divorce proceedings the parents may, sadly, accuse each other of abusing the children, and I do not think that such accusations should lead to people being placed on the register. But where a directive has been given in a civil action that someone should be kept away from a house, for example, there is no reason why that person should be left off the list. There is a difference in the required degree of proof—in civil cases, it is the balance of probability—but when are considering children's interests, the balance of probability should determine who is included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I should like to deal with the point about co-ordination and co-operation. I know that the document, "Working Together", issued in 1991, emphasised the need for the sharing of information between various agencies. As a result of that document, there is an enormous amount of local co-operation between social services, the police, workers on the ground and so on. That is very important. The document and the action taken as a result of it—co-operation and co-ordination—must have regard to the requirements of confidentiality. That is referred to in paragraph 3.10, which also encourages professional staff to do everything that they can to share and exchange relevant information especially with social services departments and the police. So there is much co-operation. I agree that that does not create a single source of information, but it all contributes towards achieving a desirable end.

Amendment No. 3 would not help at all, if were taken literally. It states that a person would become subject to the notification requirements if he had
	<br><blockquote><p>"done anything which…would have constituted a sexual offence to which this Part applies if it had been tried in a criminal court."</p></blockquote>
However, such cases should be tried in criminal courts. Civil courts have totally different standards of proof and can apply different sanctions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Tribunals are also referred to in the amendment, but I cannot envisage an industrial tribunal concluding in its report that an applicant or respondent had committed a sexual offence which could be triable in a criminal court. We are talking about serious offences where conviction requires registration, so civil proceedings have no part to play.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled because, as the Minister will know, there are difficulties bringing criminal proceedings where the principal witnesses are children. If we were dealing with any other type of case, I would understand the Minister completely.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that something might not have happened. I am saying that something such as a disciplinary hearing cannot determine such cases; it does not use the criteria that would have to be met in criminal proceedings. Any move, such as that proposed under the amendment, would leave the Government and all the individual organisations—the tribunals and so on—open to judicial review. I am sure that many people subject to such orders would want to challenge them because tribunals do not have the authority that criminal courts have in such matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Greenway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the key point the advice to Crown prosecutors? Surely there will be many instances in which there is insufficient evidence to justify bringing a prosecution. Frankly, we cannot go down the road of adding to the list all those who are suspected of committing an offence included in the schedule, although such suspicions might have been aroused because of a complaint made in an industrial tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right.

I understand why the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make clear the Opposition's attitude to the amendment. I think that the Minister is absolutely right; we must not confuse the finding of guilt in a criminal court with the findings of other tribunals. The Minister and the hon. Member for Ryedale have both made the point that I wanted to make—the Crown prosecutor should pursue cases in which there is evidence that should be tested in a criminal court. I hope that those remarks will be drawn to the attention of the crown Prosecution Service, as they represent Parliament's expectations. I am not always sure that the CPS pursues such cases in a way that is consistent with the expectations of hon. Members. That is putting it gently and politely. The Minister made the point well in his contribution; his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
remarks should be drawn to the attention of the CPS. First, the issues to which the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East referred should be brought to a criminal court so that the evidence can be tested, not just because there is a winnable case, which is the difficulty with such judgments. Secondly, there is a need for coordination of criminal convictions and other less hard information about dangers to children, which is why we have tabled amendments on how information should be handled. It is dangerous to suggest that information can be treated as if it were a criminal conviction when it is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a need for some flexibility on the period for which an offender has to provide the information required in the Bill. I appreciate that the Government have tried to lay down reasonable requirements, but the problem with such an attempt is that the requirements are necessarily arbitrary—in one case it is a few years, half that period for a younger
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
person and so on. It is difficult to see how those periods can be appropriate to the specific circumstances of the offence and the offender while taking into account the question of risk. It is that question of risk that must be at the heart of our attempt to make the legislation successful in terms of protecting children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have thought about how to increase the flexibility in a way that would not reduce the effectiveness of the Bill but would enable fine-tuning and targeting. Amendment No. 16 seeks to define the period under which an individual would have to provide notification as a minimum rather than an absolute period. That acknowledges that there may be instances where there is a need to extend the period of registration in order to protect children. We have made the case, in other discussions, for establishing indeterminate sentences, particularly for paedophile offences, so that an assessment of risk is taken into account when an individual's release from prison is considered. The amendment follows that logic. If there is a risk that an individual will commit further offences, it is crazy to end the requirement to register after a period which is not only arbitrary but which those dealing with the information may know to be inappropriate in a particular case. It the amendment is accepted, the table of periods of notification would become minimum rather than fixed. That is the trigger for the other two amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 17 would allow extension of the period of notification beyond the minimum requirement specified in clause 1, but would do so in an orderly way. That extension will be decided
	<br><blockquote><p>"by a court on the on the application of such persons whom the Secretary of State may, by order…specify?"</p></blockquote>
So the extension is subject to parliamentary and would allow the Home Secretary to consult on and decide whom it is appropriate to specify: the police, a social services department, or the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. I do not seek to answer the question; it would clearly require proper consultation to do so. The amendment would allow such flexibility. The decision would be made by a court, which means that a judicial element would be involved. We also suggest that any application made under the provision would
	<br><blockquote><p>"set out the reasons for such an extension",</p></blockquote>
so that it cannot be done arbitrarily, and would
	<br><blockquote><p>"require the support of the chief officer of police."</p></blockquote>
That would provide an element of scrutiny and would ensure that there is no gratuitous extension, but that the period is extended because those who deal with strategies for protecting children have information and good reason for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will agree that we have tried to get the balance right between judicial oversight and flexibility. Amendment No. 17 sets out the process whereby the notification requirement can be extended, but provides the protection of a legal process to deal with such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 18 considers the matter of notification not being necessary in the circumstances of the offence and the offender and offers two possibilities. The first occurs at the time of the conviction, when it is obvious to the court that although the offence falls
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
within the provisions of schedule 1, the circumstances of the offence and the offender mean that the notification requirement merely adds to the bureaucracy and does not address the protection of children or the public more generally. The amendment provides a mechanism for that possibility, but it offers a fail-safe by suggesting that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Attorney-General may appeal against any variation".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the court can decide that it makes no sense to notify in certain circumstances, but the Attorney-General can appeal and overrule that decision.
Secondly, the notification requirement may be varied after the event. Someone who is made subject to such a requirement by the court can put before the court
	<br><blockquote><p>"a certificate issued by a chief officer of police".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, there has to be agreement by the police that it is an obvious case when continued notification is not appropriate. Again, that means that an assessment of risk has been made and that the person is no longer likely to be a danger to others. Indeed, the court must be satisfied.
	<br><blockquote><p>"that it would be in the interests of justice to vary the duration of the order."</p></blockquote>
Ministers are always disinclined to give examples when asked to illustrate why a provision is needed or would work. I am not suggesting that we could define the circumstances now, but they would have to be pretty obvious. For example, an elephant, though not defined, clearly sitting on the doorstep or in the court. When it is clearly inappropriate for registration to be started or continued, the amendment would give leeway to the court to vary the requirement either at the time of sentencing or later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would give the court a limited discretion to judge cases on merit and to recognise when it was obvious that the circumstances of an offence or an offender made notification inappropriate. An example that was given to me by a Queen's counsel was a case of marital rape, where the couple were reconciled two years later. Under the requirements of the Bill, the husband would have to continue to meet the notification requirements for the rest of his life. That would be inappropriate, but to build in that one exemption would not make sense. We would have to be satisfied that it was a single offence that was not likely to be repeated. Unless there is flexibility in the Bill, however, someone could be subject to bureaucratic nonsense for his lifetime, when everyone agreed that it would be inappropriate and crazy to require him to continue to meet the notification requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to vary the period of notification—to extend it on the one hand, or to remove it in certain unusual circumstances. I have said enough to show that there would be occasions when those circumstances would arise, and I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak briefly to new clause 2 and to add my support to the amendments of the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth, which are sensible. There should be a provision to extend the period of notification, or to reduce it when justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may correct me, but the Bill makes no provision for something which is obvious. For example,
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
if a conviction is quashed, presumably there will be no commonsense requirement for someone to continue registering. There is, however, no provision in the Bill to remove the notification requirement in those circumstances. We know that there can be miscarriages of justice, so we should recognise that lack.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the more difficult issue, which the hon. Member for Ryedale mentioned in his opening remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me clarify that if a conviction is quashed the elements attached to it will fall. There will be no registration to continue and the obligation to register will come to an end with the quashing of the conviction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that that has been clarified because it is an example of when a name should be removed from the register. If there is no need to make it clearer in the Bill, I am satisified with that. There are other instances when there would be common agreement that a name need not continue to be on the register. The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth referred to a case of a married couple who had split up and come together again. There are commonsense reasons to examine the need for continued notification and there should be some procedure to allow for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his earlier remarks, the Minister said that there is a need for all the agencies to work together and to use the information that they have. I am concerned that the Government shelved the Home Office report of a year or so ago entitled, "Sex Offenders: A Guide to Inter-Agency Co-operation". Although the Government are giving lip service to the need for better co-ordination, they have not published that report, which made relevant recommendations. Perhaps the fact that those recommendations touch on resources is the reason why the report was shelved. I ask the Minister to consider publishing that report, in view of the concern expressed by the public and the Minister's comment that there should be close co-operation between the agencies. It may be that they have information that would give good cause for removing a name from the register or, as the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth said, extending the period of notification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is important…that prison and probation officers co-operate effectively to ensure that the custodial experience and supervision in the community is as constructive as circumstances and resources permit in relation to all sex offenders. Failure to do this is likely to increase the risk of re-offending on release."</p></blockquote>
I do not think that anyone would want the risks of reoffending to be increased, and I ask the Minister to publish the report and to tell us the Government's conclusions on its recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no more to say on the issue, but I hope that the Committee will conclude that there should be an appeal mechanism both to reduce and increase the period of notification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Llin Golding 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle-under-Lyme)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I say how delighted I am to see you in the Chair, Sir Roger, in a Committee that is another step towards the protection of children, which is an issue for which you have long fought?

	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
I am worried about the applicable period, which seems to be cast in stone, as the Bill stands. Given the inconsistencies in sentencing by judges and their attitudes towards the seriousness of child abuse, it would be wrong to establish an applicable period that was impossible to adjust. I am delighted that the Attorney-General can currently appeal against the length of the sentences that judges dole out. He recently referred a case involving child abuse to the Court of Appeal. It is sensible that he should have the right to consider the variation of an order that goes to the Court of Appeal. I strongly support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth and I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the remarks of the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth, who is the Opposition spokesman, and to the hon. Members for Bolton, North-East and for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mrs. Golding).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have considered the matter carefully. It is difficult to determine precisely the appropriate length of the registration period. It is essential to link the length of registration with that of conviction, because, on conviction, the court determine the guilt of the accused and the seriousness of the offence, which is reflected in the length of the sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether the mechanism for extending the period is workable or necessary. Anyone who is sentenced to two and a half years or more in prison will already be subject to a lifetime notification requirement. The Committee should bear that in mind. I trust that there is no question of extending a lifetime requirement—I do not want to be flippant, but the provision already demonstrates the gravity of the obligation and responsibility, although it is not a punishment. Only the registration obligation of those who receive shorter prison sentences or non-custodial sentences will expire. Anyone who is sentenced to more than six months in prison but less than two and a half years will have a registration obligation of 10 years, which is a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions are tough. We have decided on them with considerable care and after extensive consultation. It is difficult to envisage circumstances in which the amendment could work. I have already spoken about the circumstances governing the conviction and the sentence. I also believe that the trial judge is in the best position to determine the registration period. He hears all the evidence and determines the sentence in the light of that evidence. The amendment proposes that another court should tackle the same issues anew 10 years later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment also implies that the court should consider whether the offender's behaviour merited continued notification of his movements. The court might need more than the advice of the police, however well informed, to make an effective assessment of continuing risk. It would need other expertise such as psychiatric advice, and input from the probation service
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
to try to make a fair decision. Therefore, a significant amount of bureaucracy would have to be created to enable the courts to tackle the justification for an extended notification requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a system would not be created for the most serious cases, in which offenders are under an indefinite reporting obligation, but for those that are less serious. The existing provisions are rigorous, so the amendment would not increase the security that the Bill provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are not a belt-and-braces job, but, in relation to amendment No. 18 and new clause 2, "on the one hand, on the other hand" proposals. I appreciate the argument for building flexibility into the registration requirement, whether when the court passes sentence on or when an offender makes a subsequent application, but I do not believe that we should go down that road. The Bill relates to any person who is convicted, or who admitted to, a sexual offence against a child or a serious sexual offence against an adult. We do not believe that anyone guilty of such an offence should be able to escape the registration requirements. I emphasise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been given the example of marital rape, which I do not think a good example. I believe that that is a very serious matter. If lifetime registration were to be placed on someone with a marital rape conviction, that person would have been sentenced to two and a half years or longer. If the court had taken the view that someone was liable to that kind of penalty for marital rape, then, even if the couple were reconciled, it would be proper for us to consider that behaviour by that individual so serious as to represent a threat to society. If he was capable of that serious offence in the marital context, he is capable of that sort of behaviour on other occasions. We need the registration obligation to protect the public. I cannot accept that example as a good one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise strongly that there are no situations in which someone guilty of the relevant offences should be able to escape the registration requirement. Nor do I think that the registration period should be capable of alteration. The Bill sets tough periods of registration which will put a great obligation on people. However, those periods are also proportionate to the seriousness of the offence, as it is established at the time of sentencing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not believe that there is a case for extending the registration period. Nor do we think that that period should be capable of being shortened. The hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme referred to the criminal law and the rights of the Attorney-General. I must re-emphasise that registration legislation is not the same as criminal sentencing Bills or the powers of the Attorney-General; registration is not a sentence, but a recognition that those guilty of the relevant offences must report their movements for a period that reflects the gravity of their behaviour. I do not think that the hon. Lady has drawn an appropriate analogy. Registration is a measure for the protection of the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Golding</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the registration period is linked to the sentence? It cannot be seen in isolation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but it is linked to the sentence that the judge has passed when he has determined all the facts of the case and reached a conclusion on the gravity of the case and on the individual before him. An attempt
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
to have powers available later to change what was determined when all those relevant factors were considered would appear to be an unreliable way to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Greenway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the interests of brevity, it may be best for me to make the points I want to make through questions to the Minister. Is not this point linked to what we have already discussed? We are creating future provisions rather than retrospective provisions. Does my hon. Friend believe that the notification required—be it a lifetime, 10 years or seven years—will influence the judiciary's future sentencing of those convicted of the offences set out in the Bill? I agree that a judge who has a report before him will know more about the offending behaviour than anyone else. It seems logical that a lifetime requirement based on at least 30 months' imprisonment will be a major factor in the judge's mind when he decides what sentence to pass on the most serious offenders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is right. The judge is concerned primarily with the facts of the case, the seriousness of the offence and the nature of the defendant. But, as judges always are, he will be concerned about protection of the public and about the law available to assist him with that. The judge will know that when the Bill is enacted the registration period will follow from his decision. I agree with my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned in another way. I shall try to brief. I cannot envisage circumstances in which it would be appropriate to set aside part of the registration period at a later date. When we debated amendment No. 17 I argued that the courts would be put in a difficult position, perhaps years after the original trial, in deciding whether there were now growing signs of dangerousness, for example, which were such that an extended period of notification would be necessary. It would be perhaps even more difficult to decide that an offender no longer needed to meet the registration requirements. How would a different court reach that decision? What sort of specialist advice would it need? How can I be sure that the application of a test such as the amendment proposes would not lead to a weakening of the Bill's safeguards. If there is any doubt that it might, I am bound to urge caution on the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has comprehensive and consistent provisions. We canvassed the idea of the discretionary element in last summer's consultation document which led to the Bill. We concluded against it because the comments that we received were largely against it. I believe that such a discretionary provision is unnecessary and could weaken the Bill's protection. On that basis, I must ask the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given a thoughtful response and it is clear that he wishes to be positive. Someone giving him advice through the system, however, clearly wishes to be obstructive because he is receiving a sort of "Yes Minister" briefing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill allows no assessment of risk. The Minister said earlier that the Bill's notification requirements were not to be regarded as part of the punishment, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
that they were included for public protection. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme talked about the difficulty of getting convictions and the consequences arising from inconsistency in sentencing. Two dangers are perhaps not being taken into account. One derives from the downgrading of offences, the other from the inconsistency in sentencing that may lead to potential risk to children. We have suggested that those dangers should be covered by allowing for some flexibility in the mechanism. The courts would be asked to enter the difficult adjudication for which the Minister asks not gratuitously, because an offender wants the period annulled, but only if there is support from the police saying, "This is a difficult situation but it is still subject to the decision of the court and to appeal by the Attorney-General." The safeguards are there. Perhaps the Minister will give further thought to our suggested mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he could not envisage circumstances in which this type of variation would be appropriate. The case to which I referred was described to me by a QC; it seemed obvious after the event to those involved in the case that continued registration would be a crazy bureaucratic requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I offer other examples. Let us imagine that someone has committed an offence at a school and, as the registration period draws to an end, he is seen loitering near a school gate. He may subsequently be prosecuted for a lesser offence than the one that requires registration under the Bill. Would not that be a circumstance in which a court would decide that there were grounds for doubt? It would not extend the punishment but would state that, as there were grounds for concern, the registration period should be continued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must be a bit careful. He seems to be saying that the length of the registration period, which was based on the offence for which the person was originally convicted, could be extended even though there was no connection with the original offence and the behaviour was not subject to a criminal penalty; but that would be difficult to do. I understand what he is getting at, but I am not sure that it is achievable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that there may be evidence, which could be tested in a court—it would have to occur according to the terms of amendment—that, together with the original offence, would suggest an element of risk, and that to cut off the requirement to register at that point would be inappropriate. The provision is aimed at protecting children rather than being part of a punishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat the example. An offence has been committed against children in a school, and further behaviour gives the police and others in the vicinity of the school cause for concern. I suggest that there is a trigger connection and that the court would clearly consider the information before asking what Parliament intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give another example. An offence against children in a specific family leads to a conviction, but shortly before the period of registration ends, an injunction is granted to prevent the individual from

continuing to approach those children. Such an approach would be relevant to the original offence; it would trigger concern, and an assessment of risk would be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that such cases would need to be tested in court, which is why we have tried to build in protections. I do not envisage a massive bureaucracy. To make use of the provisions—in both directions—a clear view should be taken that the circumstances of a specific case would either make it inappropriate to continue registration, or cause continued registration to be triggered on the basis of risk. Those concerned would have to test that risk before the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman again. I am rather concerned at the route being suggested. He gave an example of someone loitering near a school and suggested that if the registration was flexible enough, and if there were suspicions about a person, not necessarily backed up by a court, the registration requirement could be altered. I have to say that whatever the circumstances, if that decision was based entirely on suspicion, a person who had previously been subject to registration would have a strong case to argue against it in court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that we should not want to keep an eye on such people in certain circumstances, but to argue for the extension of the notification requirement on the basis of suspicion only, as in the hon. Gentleman's example, is not a good reason for having such a power. How would registration be extended? Who would decide how flexible the extension should be and for how long it should continue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The court would decide whether to extend a period of registration, and those involved with child protection would have to say why it should be extended. The Minister's questions are answered in the mechanism that I suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is the Home Office's apparent view that the purpose of the Bill is simply to establish a list of addresses to make it easier for the police to find someone after the commission of a further offence. That is not our view of the Bill, which we see as protecting children and preventing the commission of offences. Therefore, the question that will need to be asked is whether a risk persists. The mechanism set out in our amendment would require the making of an assessment that a risk existed, and the satisfaction of the court on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have set out a couple of examples that would clearly provide enough evidence, not to initiate a fresh prosecution—which could be carried out under existing law—but to ensure that continued protection of children, given an assessment of possible danger to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I somewhat object to the suggestion that we are aiming to pass the most basic of measures. Following full consultation with all the agencies and parties that have an interest in the matter, we are trying to put in place an effective provision that protects children and the public. We do not, however, want to
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
pass a Bill that, for various reasons, cannot succeed but can be challenged and rendered unworkable or ineffective. That is the last thing that we want to do. The amendment would have that effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that that would happen. If it is not amended, the Bill will be inflexible and ineffective in protecting children, which is, surely, its overriding objective. I appreciate that the Minister wants to pass practical legislation and I entirely accept his motivation and reasons for arguing as he does. However, if he surveys the record of the past few years, he will find that there has been institutionalised obstruction to progress in the protection of children. I do not blame him for that, as he is the Minister who happens to be responsible for the matter now. However, people have for a long time been arguing that the matter needs to be dealt with. The amendments would make the Bill flexible enough to tackle the real priority of protecting children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made the point that I wanted to make. I hope that the Minister will reflect upon the debate and consider whether he might not have misjudged the importance and relevance of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister suggested that it would never be appropriate to cease the requirement to register. That inflexibility creates the possibility of an individual's having to go on reporting changes of address for decades, including moves from a residential home for the elderly to a hospital or hospice. There is at present no mechanism in the Bill for ending the requirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman really suggesting that serious offences against children cannot occur merely because someone reaches retirement age? His example is ludicrous. I do not have the figures immediately to hand, but I know of cases of very elderly men, who have been in residential homes, who have molested children. I hope that whatever else the hon. Gentleman says, he will not argue for an elderly person's cut-off point. The matter is not age related. All age groups—including the elder members of society—include people who are guilty of some heinous offences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am drawing a deep breath. The Minister should reread the amendment, which contains safeguards. Those include the satisfaction of the chief officer of police that the case involves no risk. They also involve consultation and a provision that the Attorney-General would be able to appeal against a decision that registration should no longer be required. I ask the Minister at least to credit us with having tried to devise a balanced mechanism that takes note of what may be extremely unusual cases. I ask him again to reflect on the amendment, which is far better targeted than he admits, and to consider whether he may be wrong in refusing flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment provides an opportunity to amend the measure in a way that, in a few cases, would avoid an elephant sitting on the Minister's doorstep in years to come saying, "Minister, I am an elephant and you did not see me coming in Committee." The hon. Gentleman may, on reflection, consider that the path of wisdom is to redraft the amendment and reintroduce it on Report. I know that the Minister wants an effective measure and,

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister please clear up one point?

We do not intend to delay commencement beyond the time that it takes for the usual arrangements to put Bills into effect.

	<p>Government amendment No. 33.</p>
	<p>No. 10, in page 3, line 33, leave out from "change" to end of line 34 and insert "of address,".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if I were to describe the Government's approach to the information to be notified by the offender to the police. The notification arrangements as drafted would place unnecessary administrative burdens on the police. The fact that the Bill, as drafted, would allow an offender to register only his name and address, without any further information to identify him, and at any police station in the UK, will not enable quick or certain matching of information with details held on the police national computer. It is therefore proposed that the details of the notification must include the name and address of the offender at the time of his conviction, any previously notified name or address, his date of birth and his current name and address. It is also proposed that the offender must register at a police station within the force area where his address lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendments Nos. 31 and 33, read with amendment No. 39, provide the requirement to give notification of a home address. The Bill requires an offender who is affected by it to register with the police his sole or main address. Amendments Nos. 10 and 19, on the other hand, seek to ensure that those who have more than one normal place of residence have to register all such addresses. The Government understand the reasoning behind this and are sympathetic to its purpose. However, the phrase "places of residence" is not sufficiently specific for a legal obligation backed by criminal sanctions. Amendment No. 11 would go further and require notification of all addresses regularly visited. We shall need to consider the frequency of visits to a certain address, and the length of those visits, to determine which addresses should attract the notification requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe, therefore, that these amendments are sufficient to deal with the problem identified. But I do recognise that a real problem has been identified, that of the offender who regularly visits an alternative address. We shall reflect on what might be done to tackle the problem, and if we can, we shall come forward with proposals during the passage of the Bill. I hope, in the light of this undertaking, that these amendments will not be pressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, amendment No. 22 requires an offender to register relevant addresses outside the UK. It is not clear, in the absence of registration schemes in other countries, what that would achieve. Someone, presumably the police, would have to notify their foreign counterparts that a paedophile was visiting their country. There is already extensive co-operation between the police in this country and abroad aimed at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
dealing with paedophiles, particularly through the work of Interpol and the National Criminal Intelligence Service. However, most countries do not have a registration scheme of the type that we are introducing, and it would be wrong to try to impose our domestic arrangements, however desirable they may be, on other countries. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth not to press this amendment either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given us another thoughtful response. I hope that as with the previous debate we cn tease out ways forward. I am grateful for the positive response that he gave to part of what we seek to do in the amendments. Of course, his promise to reflect and see whether he can come forward with amendments is helpful. I want, however, to cover a couple of points, which might assist those thought processes, and to express some puzzlement about what the Government are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister proposes amendments that will weaken the Bill but then promises to go away and think about the matter. That is somewhat puzzling. The Government want to delete subsection (1)(b), but that deals not only with a person's home but refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the address of premises in the United Kingdom which he regularly visits".</p></blockquote>
That relates to people who have no permanent home. It also raises the matter of what periods of time—and where they are spent—the Bill should target, which, as the Minister acknowledged, is an important issue. The trouble with the amendment is that it seems simply to mean—however it is phrased—that if someone gives his home address, that is the end of the requirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make it perfectly clear to the hon. Gentleman—I do not think that we are far apart on the matter—that, although technical devices are being employed in certain ways, we want the Bill to cover those people who are not necessarily at home, or in one or two homes, so that they are placed under a continuing obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggests that the words "places of residence" be used but that is a difficult phrase, as he will understand. We ask the hon. Gentleman to allow us to look at the matter partly so that the Bill can be more comprehensive in its application to people and where they may be at any time. I assure the Committee that we shall return not to diminish the Bill, but to enhance it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Minister is saying; he is going further than he did in his initial remarks, and that is helpful. Would not it be sensible for the amendments to be withdrawn, rather than for him to pretend that we have amended the Bill in a particular way? We are happy to accept that the Minister will think about our suggestions and other ways in which the matter may be dealt with. If we amend the Bill today, it will look as if we are taking it in one direction, whereas the Minister is saying that he is willing to go in a different direction. The amendments would narrow the Bill and go in the opposite direction from what we suggest, but the Minister's assurances are helpful and positive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
I am trying hard to give the Minister the opportunity to clarify his assurance. Would not it be sensible for him to say that, although he has tabled some amendments today, he recognises that they will not be satisfactory and will return with further amendments on Report after he has reflected on what we have said and perhaps talked to us in the meantime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for entertaining the Committee while I needed to discuss the matter. I understand that technical reasons linked with other parts of the Bill mean that the approach that he suggests would not be not sensible. I want to make it clear to him that I am not trying to renege on what I have said—we are trying to enhance the Bill. I am sure that I know what the hon. Gentleman's intentions are—my right ear told me exactly what he meant—and we shall ensure that we produce something that is more effective in doing with what we all agree is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is extremely helpful, so I shall keep my remarks brief. We wanted to deal with the fact that sex offenders may have more than one address. As the Bill is drafted, only the main address need be given, but another house might be used for paedophile activities, or the address given might not be the only residence. Therefore, a requirement to register all residences, such as that in amendment No. 19, should be introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be pleased if the Minister were to explore that proposal to try to ensure that all appropriate residences or all places that convicted paedophiles visit come within the scope of the Bill, making it more effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only caveat that I would attach to what the hon. Gentleman said is that there is a 	<i>de minimis</i> position where we would agree that it would be unworkable to say that an individual has to notify the police of every place that he visits. The point is that a certain regularity must be considered, even if it is not the permanence that use of the term "sole or main residence" originally attached to these provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Minister is saying. I am sure that he would not want to be held to promises that go beyond what he has already said. I understand that there is a limit to what can be required. Flexibility is necessary, however, because of the risk to children that an individual poses and because of the nature of his lifestyle, which might be relevant to his opportunity to reoffend. I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he is considering such matters. The Opposition stand ready to save the time of the House of Commons and assist the Government, if we can, by discussing how to produce an amendment that we can all support on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter of addresses abroad is not one of going into other jurisdictions. Some British citizens, even those involved in politics, have permanent residence abroad; others have holiday homes abroad. It is a difficult matter, but if British citizens spend the majority, or even a considerable amount, of their time abroad it is in the interests of child protection that they be required to notify the police of their addresses abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
The Minister well knows the concerns that have been expressed in the House about the activities of paedophile rings abroad as well as those in the United Kingdom. We do not seek to extend jurisdiction to offences that take place abroad, but merely to extend the requirement on people convicted of offences listed in schedule 1 to register their addresses abroad as well as those in the United Kingdom. I do not want to bounce the Minister into accepting that proposal, but I should like him to give further thought to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do just that. However, there are problems of enforceability and of checking the reliability of information given. I am advised that in terms of jurisdiction and enforceability the Opposition's aims would be almost impossible to achieve. I am not optimistic, but I am prepared to consider that specific point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that event, I should say that we are seeking not a perfect solution but one which requires individuals to notify the police of their addresses abroad as well as those in the United Kingdom. I understand the point about the difficulty in checking, but if the individual provided false information, he would be failing to comply with the requirements in the Bill. So there may not be as much distance between us as the Minister thinks, if a little creative thought is given to how the provisions of the amendment could be pursued in a way that avoids the difficulties he outlined. In the light of the Minister's assurance, it would be churlish to do anything other than to seek leave to withdraw the amendments. I look forward to discussions on the subject before and on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Opposition amendments have not been moved, they do not need to be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make one brief point. The NSPCC has said in representations to me that it would like to see a European-wide register of paedophiles. What discussions has the Minister had with his counterparts in European countries on that? Has he had full co-operation from them? We know that there have been the most horrible paedophile offences in Brussels, which have extended up to senior levels in the Belgian Administration. I would like an assurance from the Minister that there are discussions with European countries on a sex offender register that would cover all the countries in the European Union. Perhaps he will also clarify how far the terms of the Bill extend within Britain: I do not know whether the Isle of Man and the Channel islands are included, or even Northern Ireland. Perhaps he could make clear that the provisions will extend throughout Britain and that he is having discussions with other European countries to extend the terms of the Bill even further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My first point relates to the hon. Gentleman's last point. The powers will extend to the whole of the United Kingdom; initially they will refer to the main parts, including Scotland and Northern Ireland, but there will be a power to extend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
provisions to the islands, particularly the Isle of Man, and we hope that that will happen. That is the norm with such legislation. On discussions with Europe, much is happening in the European Union, at ministerial and official level—as I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows. I have had not formal but informal discussions with several of my opposite numbers. European co-operation is developing well. The DNA database provisions, for instance, and the sharing of information and expertise are great success stories in which we are taking the lead. We are also working hard to achieve co-operation in a wider international sense, outside the European Union, where many of the problems arise. Much of the legislation that we have recently been considering is designed to assist us in our co-operation with international agencies and countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 32, in page 3, line 32, after "above" insert "or this paragraph".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a small amendment that makes it clear that when notifying a change of name, all other names previously notified must also be provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly puzzled by the amendment, which seems unnecessary. Surely if there has been a notification, paragraph (a) of the clause ceases to apply, whereas if there has not, it cannot apply. I do not see how the amendment clarifies the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can do so. I am assured that the amendment will have the effect that I described to the Committee, and I shall probably now be assured that it is vital and integral to everything that we are planning to do. I shall certainly take further advice, but in the meantime I must hold my ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be happy to receive a little explanation and textual analysis from the Minister in due course, but I will not obstruct our progress now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One point has bothered me that relates to some of our previous debates, but which I would like to raise now. Sadly, children themselves can be abusers. As I understand the Bill, it may require even an eight-year-old in Scotland to have his name registered. Children often have nicknames, so I am confused about how the Bill will apply. Also, for what length of time will it apply? We have already discussed whether a name can be taken off the list. Will the Minister clarify the position of eight-year-olds in Scotland and 10-year-olds in England? Will there be a lifetime requirement on such children to register?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Children are often called in the family by a name that is not their legal name. Will such nicknames have to be registered as well, and will children be under a lifelong requirement to register under all the different names? I am not sure how the Bill will apply, and—to refer to an earlier debate—I hope that the Minister will recognise that there are circumstances in which people should not have a lifetime requirement to register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a sensible amendment, but one further point occurred to us after the date for tabling amendments. Will the person providing the information about a change of address be required to give proof of identity? Should that be written into the Bill—as far as I can see, it is not in the Bill as drafted—or can the matter be dealt with in another way? Obviously, it is important that correct information should be given to the police by the correct person, so that there is no question of someone later claiming that the information is erroneous. That ties in with the importance of records being accurate, which the amendment is intended to ensure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister of State made some references to that matter on Second Reading. First, it will be an offence to provide false information—that is the first safeguard. Secondly, it is difficult to write into the Bill a precise description of what people must provide. The procedure will probably involve completing a form that will contain a checklist of details of identity. It is unnecessary to include further specifics in the Bill; it is safe for us to state in that form that identity must be proved and to rely on the sanctions that will be available if false information is provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's position, and clearly it is right to say that an offence is committed if false information is given. It may not always be possible, however, to identify who gave that false information—for example, it might be given anonymously rather than by an individual who had made his identity clear to the police. As a result, the police might not know an individual's location after the event. The policeman who receives such information should satisfy himself of the informant's identity, and there should be a record of that identification in case questions subsequently arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is raising a question about procedures, which we shall discuss later.

The amendment fits well with the obligations that will fall on an offender. I shall later return to the question of detail that the hon. Gentleman raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 3, leave out line 43.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment involves a simple and straightforward proposal. Subsection (3) identiifies certain circumstances that should be disregarded in relation to registration. Paragraph (a) states, for obvious reasons, that the registration requirement should not apply to someone who is
	<br><blockquote><p>"remanded in or committed to custody by an order of a court".</p></blockquote>
We are worried that paragraph (d) does not seem to be of the same order as paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). I have just quoted paragraph (a); paragraph (b) states that the registration requirement should not apply to someone who is
	<br><blockquote><p>"serving a sentence of imprisonment",</p></blockquote>
and paragraph (c) states that it should not apply to someone who is "detained in a hospital". Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are clear and straightforward—they are bureaucratic proposals that ensure that the requirement will apply, for example, when a person is moved from one prison to another. They are sensible proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (d), however, states that the requirement will not apply to someone who is "outside the united Kingdom". The danger is that the paragraph will create a get-out clause for people who fall under the Bill's provisions, who are convicted in the United Kingdom and who move abroad. If that get-out clause were deleted, the requirement to register would be extended to people who are abroad. That may involve registering either the fact that they are going to go abroad or the address that they will live at while they are abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it is drafted, paragraph (d) removes all obligations to register. It appears to allow people to go abroad, to return and thereby to evade the police's scrutiny and the requirement to report to the police. That is a small but perhaps important gap in the legislation, especially in relation to schedule 2 and the nature of the paedophile links that extend within the United Kingdom and abroad, which we have discussed in the House of Commons over the past year. Deleting the paragraph would not weaken the Bill; it would ensure that the getout will not be exploited by those who might have had the ingenuity to try to use it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no requirement to register on those who leave the United Kingdom. That is a matter of practicality and of enforcement. I earlier discussed the difficulties with dealing with foreign jurisdictions and countries. If an offender leaves and then returns within the registration period—I emphasise that many such periods are extremely long—he will be required to register. Although I understand what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting, it is a little fanciful to imagine that many offenders will move abroad until the expiration of the registration period solely to avoid registration. I am not sure whether I can take my remarks much further. The measure is appropriate and reflects the need to ensure that every aspect of the Bill is enforceable and effective. Paragraph (d) introduces a necessary protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned that the police and those concerned with child protection may lose track of offenders. If an individual goes abroad shortly after being sentenced, the Minister is right to say that that individual will be committing an offence if he returns and fails to register. Such an offence would be extremely difficult to detect, however, because the continuity would have been destroyed. If the requirement still obtains while abroad, the obligation on the individual is that much tighter. Our proposal would not apply to many individuals and is an attempt to close a loophole. It was in that spirit that we tabled the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot recommend that the Committee accepts the amendment, for reasons of enforceability from a practical point of view. I understand the motives behind it but I cannot accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must be content that the Minister has understood the motives behind the amendment and to take that as a favourable, not unfavourable comment. I hope that he will reflect on the matter but, as I do not wish to detain the Committee, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 3, line 44, after "A" insert "person may give a".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 36 to 38.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I foreshadowed in my earlier remarks, the amendments would ensure that the offender notified his details to the police station in his local police force area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the Minister would explain the intentions and exact effects of the amendments. I understand the implications of amendments Nos. 35 and 36, but I am not so clear about amendment No. 37, which provides that the offender must register his address or change of address at the police station
	<br><blockquote><p>"in his local police area".</p></blockquote>
Why is that? Is it because it is felt that the police station and the police in the local area will be most immediately in need of that information? If that is so, it is understandable. However, if the individual had more than one home, police stations in different parts of the country would need the information. How would the Minister deal with such a scenario? Would we have to interpret the Bill to allow alternatives? It would be helpful if the Minister could explain the Government's approach to that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The definition of "local police area" is the police area in which a person's home is situated. A "police area" is that defined by the police authorities as being a specific area. That is the best way to describe it. We want to achieve registration in a particular police area for administrative and other reasons. There is a problem—I accept what the hon. Gentleman said about
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
multiplicity of addresses. We have debated that and I hope that it will be clarified as soon as possible. It is important to incorporate it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the Minister correctly, he intends to take up my point when he tables his amendment to clarify how we will deal with two homes in separate police force areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I am happy to leave the matter for the time being.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment defines "home address". On a previous clause, the Minister moved an amendment to remove that definition and to leave only the words "home address". When he was challenged on that, he said there was a technical problem with the drafting because other changes in the Bill depended on referring simply to "home address". It appears, therefore, that there must also be a drafting problem with this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>(2) A Code of Practice made under subsection (1) above shall be laid before Parliament in draft and shall be subject to approval by a resolution of each House before being made,".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important amendment. It deals with the issue that I flagged on Second Reading and in our short debate on the sittings motion this morning. We believe that the Bill's requirements will lead to offenders registering information with the police, but it does not create a register, nor does it provide the mechanisms for meeting what is clearly the expectation on both sides of the House and among those agencies involved in child protection, namely, a way to increase the capacity of the system to protect children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill seems to require that the offender notify the information to the police, who pop it into the police national computer where it stays and is used as all other information on the computer. The advantage is that the police have a more up-to-date address. Therefore, if they want to interview a specific person in relation to any fresh offences, their chances of finding him quickly are slightly improved. I am not saying that such a measure is a bad thing, but the objective is far more limited than that of the many people, inside and outside the House, who called for the establishment of a paedophile register. We want to ensure that something more important happens: that the information registered is used as part of a far more effective system for protecting children against individuals who or groups which, in the past, have proved extremely successful in getting round any protections and continued to pose a danger to children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 9 would give the Home Secretary the power to set down a code of practice, which would
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
be enabled by Statutory instrument. There is no requirement for amendment and change through the more difficult mechanisms of primary legislation and, therefore, there is a little more flexibility to keep up with changes in circumstances. The Home Secretary will also be able to consult widely with organisations concerned with child protection and civil liberties, with the police and with other bodies with experience and knowledge, to ensure that the mechanisms to deliver what the Bill promises are put in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 4 sets out what would be included in such a code of practice. First, the code would explain how the information notified to the police under the legislation would be registered and maintained—it creates the structure for the register. Secondly, it would set out which people can have access to the information so notified—that is not covered by the Bill, but it is important. Thirdly—this is most important—the new code would set out
	<br><blockquote><p>"the responsibilities of the police and others to co-operate in using information so notified for the protection of the public, including, but not confined to, responsibilities for providing information and advice to members of the public and to statutory and voluntary organisations."</p></blockquote>
The new clause would allow a proper response to and use of the information, graded according to the degree of risk and the circumstances of the offender, immediately after the offence and conviction, and later. It provides the flexibility to fulfil the wish of the House to provide a proper framework for the use of information to protect children. As it stands, the Bill does not include a mechanism for using the information to protect children. We proposed the amendments to provide such a structure and to ensure that the police, public bodies and voluntary organisations can coordinate their action to protect children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill covers a range of offences and because circumstances and risks vary widely, there is no one simple approach that will work. I have suggested the need for flexibility. We want the Home Secretary to have the responsibility to establish a code of practice and to be able to establish a mechanism to link the information required under the Bill with national and local child protection initiatives. In other words, we want to ensure that the structures are in place to make the Bill work as Parliament intends. That is the purpose behind the amendment and the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clapham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To add to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth, the code of practice could strengthen the Bill and would have protected a constituent of mine who suffered a horrendous experience. A widow with two young children subsequently married a paedophile, not knowing the man's background. The marriage had been brought about purely and simply because the man wanted to get to the children. The code of practice would prevent such a situation from arising because, presumably, it would provide a link with other services and agencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
