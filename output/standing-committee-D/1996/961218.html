	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Doug Henderson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle upon Tyne, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules (House of Commons paper No. 31).</p></blockquote>
The Opposition have prayed against the changes in immigration rules because substantial representations have been made to me and to my hon. Friends about a number of aspects of the new rules. I am pleased that the Minister has with him such esteemed colleagues. I can only assume that that is a reward for attending an ex-Defence Minister's party last evening—they must have been asked whether they wanted to consider immigration rules this evening. I assure the Minister that I have esteemed colleagues with me; others may join us later to take part in our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that such measures should be considered by the House so that we understand exactly what they mean. The rules are intended to implement in a commonsense way matters that have already been debated, so it should have been possible to acknowledge that there had to be changes. People on whom the regulations have an impact should have felt comfortable with them, but because of the background to immigration and asylum policy over the past 12 months, there is a great deal of suspicion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Organisations that have spoken to me doubt the Government's motives for introducing the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 which relates to the immigration rules—they think that the measure has more to do with raising immigration as a political issue at this time than with the regulation of immigration. Those organisations take the view that unless the Government are able to counteract that charge, there will be, at minimum, a semi-permanent damaging impact on community and race relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point makes it all the more important that we examine the detail of the rules to discover whether they are neutral in that they relate only to the implementation of matters already decided or whether they take things further and will, perhaps, further damage community and race relations; many Opposition Members think that that has been the impact of the 1996 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have three specific points to make. First, paragraph 1 excludes two new benefits—they were not listed in the previous immigration rules—including child benefit. That is very damaging because the Government have acknowledged its importance as a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
universal benefit. Indeed, in a written answer, the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Mitchell) stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have a manifesto commitment to pay child benefit to all families in respect of all children, and we have honoured that pledge. We believe that all families with dependent children should receive some help from either the tax or the benefit system, a principle recognised throughout Europe."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 12 November 1996; Vol. 258, c. 196.]</p></blockquote>
The organisations that have dealt with that subject in their communications with me believe that paragraph 1 of the rules could contradict that commitment. They quote the example of a couple who live here, but whose children live abroad—a fairly regular occurrence among people who move internationally and whose children have remained in the previous country's school system. If such children then arrive in this country, they will probably be subject to the condition that they are not a charge on state resources—they should have no recourse to public funds, to use the precise terminology. If children are subject to such a condition and their parents are ineligible to claim child benefit, the commitment that was given by the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security in his written answer cannot be fulfilled. That disturbs many of the organisations that represent immigrants. It concerns me, too, because the Government did not appear to want to exclude such people during deliberations on the Asylum and Immigration Bill or in other recent debates in the House on immigration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue that has been brought to my attention concerns provisions for spouses in paragraph 3 and subsequent paragraphs. The rules that were introduced in August made it clear that spouses who entered this country could have no recourse to public funds. Several categories of person were omitted then, but have now been included. The extensions cover postgraduate doctors and dentists, au pairs and seasonal workers. Until now, the Secretary of State has had the discretion to decide whether such people could claim public support in special circumstances. Postgraduate students from war-torn zones might, for example, be reallocated halfway through their courses and invited to continue studying in Britain. Their spouses might, however, be able to come here only later. I should have thought that the Government would want to treat such applications sympathetically. Those who have communicated with me want to know whether the new rules will prevent the Secretary of State from exercising discretion compassionately, as he can now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third concern that has been brought to my attention pertains to paragraph 2. The new rules permit the revocation of entry clearance when an entry officer is satisfied that
	<br><blockquote><p>"false representations were employed or material facts were not disclosed"</p></blockquote>
on application. Our immigration rules already empower the Secretary of State to make such a revocation, however. During consideration of the Asylum and Immigration Bill, members of the Committee debated those powers at length in the context of political asylum. It is, of course, reasonable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
and fair to reconsider the case of someone who deliberately misleads an officer and provides false information to breach our immigration rules. It would also be fair if that led to a different result. I thought, however, that the Secretary of State already had the power to take such actions—he certainly has a discretionary power to do so. Why are the Government introducing further changes to the rules when they already have such powers? I wonder whether it is because of the recent Al-Massari case and whether the Government felt hamstrung in that case by existing regulations. As we know, they ended up falling foul of our legal system and their wishes could not be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are the Government introducing further change? There was a reference to the public interest, but the Secretary of State already has the power to exclude someone in the public interest. Why do the Government want to make further changes? What cases are the changes meant to catch?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an entry clearance officer were asked to review a case and revoked the original decision, would there be an appeal? As I understand it, there would be an appeal against the first decision made by the entry clearance officer if it went against the applicant's wishes. But if the case were reconsidered by the entry clearance officer and the decision revoked, would the applicant have a further opportunity to appeal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems reasonably fair play that if a second judgment is made by the immigration authorities—I am not, in principle, against that—the applicant should also have a second opportunity to explain, clarify and demonstrate changed circumstances and pursue an appeal which may or may not be effective. The person should at least have the chance to make an appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could argue other points about the rules and perhaps some of my colleagues will want to raise them, but those are the three principal points. I should be interested to hear the Minister's response and I am sure that the people who communicated with me also want to know the Government's intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.42 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Alton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Mossley Hill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concur with the three points made by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North (Mr. Henderson) and I am sure that we all look forward to hearing the Minister's response. Although many of the members of this Committee were not members of the Committee that considered the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, it might be tedious to go over those arguments again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They might be educated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They might be educated, but I do not think that they would thank us. Those arguments are contained in the 	<i>Official Report.</i> A number of short questions arise from the arguments that we had at the end of last year and the beginning of this year and from the rule changes before us, and I should like to put them to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
I agree with what the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North said about the motives behind the changes. There is a sense that it is convenient at this time to return to the issue and make relatively small changes, which we seem to make a great meal over. There are many issues that the Home Office should be considering in the aftermath of Dunblane, the killing of Philip Lawrence and the culture of violence in our country. Surely changes such as these should rank very low on the agenda if we are considering what are the most important matters before the public today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's motives come out in the way in which they have gone about the consultation process for the rules and the way they have been put before us today. Why, when the Government sent out the guidance notes to employers—Members of the Committee have also been furnished with them—did they change some of the wording of the original draft document, of which I have a copy? I refer in particular to the phrases at the beginning of the document, in the paragraph entitled "The Background", which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Easy access to work has made the United Kingdom an attractive destination for illegal immigrants. This denies jobs to people living here who are entitled to work."</p></blockquote>
Clearly that incites a sense of anger that people are coming here to take the jobs of British people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government decided to modify that language, presumably as a result of representations by the Commission for Racial Equality. If that was the reason for the change—I should be interested to hear from the Minister whether it was I welcome it. Anyone looking at page 2 of the guidelines sent to hon. Members will see that different words have since been incorporated in the document. Even so, the original words were included in the letter, signed by the Home Secretary, that accompanied the brochure sent out to 8,000 people. If those words were omitted because the Government agreed with the CRE that they were likely to inflame xenophobic feelings or racial tensions, why were they used in that letter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another interesting point is that that letter, which contains language that many hon. Members would consider unfortunate, was not included in the package of material sent to members of the Committee, nor made available in this room. I hope that the Minister will explain that omission, which is an affront to the Committee. Like me, the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North was a member of the Standing Committee examining the Asylum and Immigration Bill. He will recall that documents often were not made available to hon. Members who were considering the important questions arising and who had a right to see them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next question has to do with the mixture of carrot and stick in the document sent to employers. A paragraph on page 2 begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If you try to avoid prosecution by refusing to consider for a job anyone who looks or sounds foreign".</p></blockquote>
Does not the Minister agree that the use of that phrase is almost bound to stop employers looking at the detail of the rest of the document? Instead, they will examine the names of people applying for jobs and question their skin colour and where they come from. Will not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
that have an effect in terms of the sort of people who are likely to secure employment in the future? I assume that the Minister will disagree with me about that and that, to prove me and people like me wrong, he will be all in favour of such matters being monitored in the future. Is that so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Timothy Kirkhope)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will answer that when I reply to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, but I assume that the Home Office will want to monitor such matters. If so, I presume that to carry out an overview of the implementation of the regulations and to care for people who will be displaced and become illegals, it will refer to the Refugee Council, Refugee Action, the Scottish Refugee Council, the Ockenden Venture, the Refugee Arrival Project and all the other groups that in the past were financed by the Home Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The practical effect of the rules is that immediately before their 1 January implementation, employers may have got rid of people who might be regarded as illegals. That may even explain the sharp reduction in unemployment in the past month or so revealed in the figures released today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result may be that jobs will be available for native British residents. All hon. Members, especially those who represent areas of high local unemployment, will be pleased that people who live in this country will have the chance to work. However, that will simply create another set of problems. People will live illegally on the streets and shanty towns such as those in the United States of America will be created. An underclass will form, made up of people who will be lured into prostitution, vice and crime. That will not solve any of our problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On top of all that, it was reported in the press yesterday that grants to the organisations that advise and support refugees and their families—the same organisations that I have just named and which I assume will monitor the effect of the rules—are to be reduced by a staggering 50 per cent., from £3.4 million to £1.5 million. That is not a marginal reduction, but the Home Office has said only that no final decision has yet been reached. Will the Minister say whether those grants will be cut? Hon. Members who must decide whether to divide the Committee over these rules need to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Cardinal Hume opened the Refugee Council's night shelter in September, he said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the reception given to those applying for asylum is an illuminating indicator of the state of a society's moral health".</p></blockquote>
He also said that the Government have
	<br><blockquote><p>"a moral responsibility not only to monitor the situation carefully, but also to provide financial support to those voluntary organisations who are taking the strain."</p></blockquote>
Since the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 went on to the statute book this year, voluntary organisations, local authorities and charitable bodies have been taking the strain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
If there is to be a massive reduction in funding, it will be one of the most disgraceful things that I can imagine. No one will be able to accuse the Government of festive good cheer, This time last year they tried to rush through changes to the social security orders, again hitting asylum seekers, and they went on to do so after Christmas. Not only do I want to hear the Minister's assurances on this matter, but I hope that the new year will not bring the sort of orders—removing the rights and benefits to which the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North referred earlier—that we saw at the beginning of this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should reflect carefully on the cruel dilemma in which the weakest members of our society find themselves. Not only does this measure create the illegals that I mentioned, not only does it create a substrata of society, but it damages the reputation of politicians and the Government. It is seen as Gradgrinding, as mean. It damages the Government's reputation if they go for tiny, vulnerable groups of people and stir up feeling that masses of people—millions of them—are swamping our country, taking our jobs, our livelihoods and our homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules exploit and misuse a group of people who are extremely vulnerable. We should always behave as we would wish others to behave towards us. Above all, we should not try to deny to others what has been made available to us in a civilised society by different Governments of different persuasions in the past. This is not a party political question—at least, it should not be. It is about the values that a society has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when the Minister replies, he will not rehearse again all the arguments that we went over when the 1996 Act was being considered in Committee, on the Floor of the House or in subsequent committees, but will reflect on the purpose of spending yet more parliamentary time on this matter, the motives behind introducing further measures and the practical effects on helping vulnerable groups if the cuts that have been reported this week are implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.53 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I set out briefly the nature of the rules, may I react to the comments of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Mossley Hill (Mr. Alton)? I am entirely in your hands, Mr. Hill, and I do not want to try your patience. Therefore, I will not go down the route that he has outlined because, with the greatest respect to him, the issues concerning the prevention of illegal working emanating from section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 are not before the Committee today. Indeed, the reference to refugees and to the speculation in the press and elsewhere are also not matters which I am here to address today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that I do not need to tell the hon. Gentleman that he should not always believe everything that he reads in the newspapers. I can assure him that we are considering, among many other matters, the grants for refugee and asylum seeker organisations, and shall reach a conclusion shortly. I

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
hope, therefore, that he will reflect on his tirade and hold back on his condemnation considering that a decision has not yet been taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must realise that these matters are in the public domain. It has been reported in a national newspaper and it is therefore legitimate for hon. Members to raise them in the context of today's debate. I specifically asked the Minister how he intends to monitor the effect of the rules on people who are displaced from employment and who will end up living on the street, especially if such cuts were to be imposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was talking about the result of the comprehensive and helpful guidance that was given to employers following section 8 of the new Act. Incidentally, the letter to which the hon. Gentleman referred was not part of the guidance, even though it may have accompanied it. I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not draw too many conclusions from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidance is an important element in helping employers to determine whether someone who applies to them for employment is entitled to be employed. I am not prepared to go back over all the ground that we covered in Committee on what was the Asylum and Immigration Bill. It is important, however, that people who are not entitled to work in this country should not take jobs that may well be sought by those who are entitled to work here and are legally in this country: that would be wrong. I do not think that I need any lessons in morality about that. We believe that that is appropriate. We have passed the law, to which the guidance is a follow-up; we believe that it is helpful to employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course we will carefully monitor the effects—employers' organisations will be sure to let us know. The guidance was drawn up in conjunction with the Commission for Racial Equality. We are sure that we shall receive clear indications as to how successful or otherwise the guidance is and whether we shall need to adapt it in due course. Those two items are not directly related to the rules, however, and I shall say why later. I should like now to move to the main issues and discuss the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the points that the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North raised as I make my introduction—I shall try to deal with all of them in the course of my speech. The debate is an important one. I want to be able to explain the purpose and effect of the changes in the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members who have an interest in immigration matters will know, the cornerstone of UK immigration law is the Immigration Act 1971 and the various subsequent amending Acts, most recently the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. The 1971 Act empowers my right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary to lay before Parliament rules as to the practice to be followed by those who administer the Act. Those rules have been amended and developed over the years to reflect changes in circumstances and policy. The current statement of changes was laid on 31 October and took effect on 1 November. A number
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
of miscellaneous changes were made to the rules, including an amended definition of public funds—I point out that the definition does not refer to entitlement of public funds; it is merely a definition of public funds which arises from the changes that have been made to the law elsewhere—provision for the revocation of an entry clearance, and other minor changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 1 of the rules change amends the definition of public funds in paragraph 6 of the previous rules. The new benefits that have been added are housing—accommodation and assistance—child benefit—to which the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North referred—and jobseekers allowance. Those changes and others that we have recently made to the definition of public funds derive from scrutiny of the enforcement of immigration laws. That scrutiny found that many people who were either here unlawfully or who had been admitted on the clear understanding that they would not have recourse to public funds were gaining access to publicly funded benefits and services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, the Home Secretary announced a programme of work which was agreed by the Government to implement recommendations that were made by that scrutiny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say how many examples there are of people who were originally admitted on the basis of having no recourse to public funds and who then had public funds allocated to them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot, offhand. I am, however, assured by my officials that there have been many such cases. It is clearly right to be concerned—we are custodians of the public purse, and if such examples are occurring, it is our job to ensure, via scrutiny and in other ways, that those resources are not wasted. I now want to make some progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that many people reading the 	<i>Hansard</i> report of our proceedings will have a significant interest in organisations such as the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants? Such people will say that the absence of statistics suggests that there are political motives behind the introduction of the regulations. If Parliament has any meaning, we should at least know how many instances there have been of this reversal of "no recourse to public funds" to "claiming public funds". How can the Government justify changing the rules without any statistical basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that there are statistics, and I could find them for the hon. Gentleman. However, even if there were only one case, it would still be inappropriate for us not to ensure that people receive only public funds to which they are entitled. It would be almost negligence if we did not ensure that. It has nothing to do with political motivations: it is simply that we are guardians of the public purse and we have a duty to allow benefit only to those who are entitled to it. What sort of example is set by the hon. Member
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
for Newcastle upon Tyne, North in suggesting that we should not produce a tough law because only a few instances of abuse are known?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know, for example, of over 2,000 bogus identities being used in the past year by Nigerians to claim more than £1 million in Department of Social Security benefits. There is an enormous list of such cases. I shall not bore the Committee, and I shall write to the hon. Gentleman with the relevant details. But I have to tell him that I am aware of cases. I know of another instance in which an alleged student fraudulently applied in 37 identities for student awards amounting to £100,000. We must deal with that sort of abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recommendations were intended to ensure that people who were living here unlawfully or for a temporary purpose—such as business men or students—did not receive benefits to which they were not entitled. In October, my hon. Friend the Minister of State announced the successful completion of the programme, including the creation of a coherent legal framework barring immigration offenders and those on limited leave from access to various important and expensive non-contributory benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One effective way of helping to achieve that objective is to make it a condition of those given limited leave to enter or remain that they do not have recourse to public funds. The list of public funds has therefore been extended to include those noncontributory benefits that are now linked to immigration status. That makes it clear which benefits are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that the change to the rules is concerned solely with the definition of public funds, not with entitlement. Paragraphs 3, 6, 8 and 9 add to the criteria for admission and leave to remain a requirement that post-graduate doctors and dentists, au pairs and seasonal agricultural workers must be able to maintain and accommodate themselves and any dependants without recourse to public funds. That applies, and always has, to other categories of the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the points made earlier by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North we see no reason why post-graduate doctors and dentists, au pairs and seasonal agricultural workers should be treated any differently from any other group. By mere coincidence and gaps in the rules, they have not been so treated in the past. Unless the hon. Gentleman has a particularly pressing argument I can see no reason why they should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister explain why they were not included in the August changes to the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot. They may have missed the net because of the description of the workers, the nature of the jobs or the way in which the definitions have changed regarding specific categories. The hon. Gentleman appeared to argue that those groups should have a separate right and I would like him to justify that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to intervene interminably but I must answer the Minister. That was not the point that I was making. My original submission was that at present the Secretary of State has discretion in dealing with certain cases compassionately, but that if the rules are introduced and new conditions inserted, the Secretary of State will be prohibited from exercising that discretion. I asked whether that was the case, and I am trying to get an answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry—I have not yet dealt with that. But the hon. Gentleman is right to say that the Secretary of State has a discretion, which will remain. We are not removing it at this stage because in general we see no reason to treat these groups any differently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have chit-chat across the Floor. The Minister is speaking. If the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North wishes to intervene, I shall be only too pleased to put it to the Committee that he wishes to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot develop the argument any further. We think that all groups, when identified and describable, should be given the same treatment. We see no reason to do otherwise. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has another reason for asking his question but I cannot give him an answer other than to say that discretion remains with the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the rules make provision for the admission and extension of stay of dependants of respective students. No such provision was made in previous rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have introduced a new power that will allow entry clearance officers abroad to revoke an entry clearance prior to a passenger seeking leave to enter the United Kingdom where evidence comes to light that it has been obtained by misrepresentation or where the applicant's circumstances have changed and the original decision would be invalid. This power, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, simply fills a loophole in the current immigration rules and facilitates the Government's ability to tackle those who employ deliberate deception to circumvent our immigration control. For the sake of fairness, it is framed in the same terms as the power currently available to immigration officers to refuse leave to enter. As such, it could also be used where a person's circumstances have changed for reasons beyond their control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not our main intention that the power be used in those circumstances but it is right and fair that it be consistent. Nor do we wish to disadvantage anyone caught in these circumstances. The decision to revoke entry clearance will not attract a right of appeal—which must be right—but when it has been revoked the new facts of a case will be reviewed and a new decision made on them. In all cases the applicant will be advised in full of the reasons for the decision to revoke entry clearance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene but the Committee's purpose is to examine the detail, and this is perhaps the easiest way of doing it. Can the Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
say how many times in the past 12 months, or longer, the Government have been unable to revoke the resident status of an immigrant because circumstances had changed? We know that after changing the regulations the Government will be able to revoke a decision to allow a person to enter the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I shall have to notify the hon. Gentleman of the precise number. It is not merely a question of the number of cases. There is a gap in the system whereby an entry clearance officer cannot at present revoke clearance before a person leaves the country even if it becomes clear that some misrepresentation has been deployed to obtain clearance. That seems wrong. It leads to pressure on the immigration officer in the United Kingdom who can, of course, refuse leave to enter, and will still be able to do so here. This pressure is ridiculous because despite knowledge held about a person through the entry clearance system he or she cannot be prevented from travelling to this country. This provision has existed for some time but it is wrong. We are simply making sure that the rules are changed to give the power that is sought. No one is deprived of rights because if a genuine mistake has been made the matter can be reviewed again. That seems sensible; it is regulating at both ends. It will also mean that expectations have not built up if people are not able to leave to come here in the first place. It has not been done for any other motive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all cases, the applicant will be advised in full of the reasons for the decision to revoke clearance. In those cases where the original application would have attracted a right of appeal, the new decision will also do so. It is not inevitable that each new decision will necessarily be a refusal. A new visa may be issued where appropriate. Full guidance has been given to ECOs about the circumstances on which revocation is the right course of action. I assure you, Mr. Hill, that revocation will be used sparingly, but it will be used in those cases where it is appropriate and necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs 10 and 12 make a minor technical amendment to the rules, which makes it clear that where people travel and return to the United Kingdom within the period of their leave and, therefore, do not require a visa to return, they must return for the same purpose for which the earlier leave was granted. They cannot circumvent the rules by returning for a purpose for which a fresh visa should otherwise have been obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal quickly with the issue of child benefit, which the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North raised. Eligibility for child benefit depends on the status of the parents. If the parents have a settled status in the United Kingdom, dependent children will be admitted without conditions attached to their stay. There will not be any prohibition on their recourse to public funds. That is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the parents are on limited leave and subject to a prohibition to recourse to public funds—in effect, they will have made a contract stating that they will not be a drain on public resources—their children will have to be admitted on similar conditions. Again, that is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
perfectly equitable and fair. I do not understand why the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North should think that it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt with most, if not all, the points raised. If I have missed anything, I shall write to hon. Members. I commend the rule changes to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Piara S. Khabra 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, Southall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want clarification of one point. Paragraph 2 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An entry clearance may be revoked if the entry Clearance Officer is satisfied that …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(iii) the holder's exclusion from the United Kingdom would be conducive to the public good."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister define "public good"? How much scope does an entry clearance officer have to take account of those circumstances when he would like to excluce a person?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, North wish to speak?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.12 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, if the proceedings are to end if I do not. I want to make a couple of further points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My speech was designed to ask questions of the Minister. Perhaps wrongly, I hoped that I would get answers to the points raised. When I read the record, it may help to clarify some of them. However, the Minister's verbal response has not left me very clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not seeking to change the regulations for child benefit in this Committee. I asked a question about the circumstances in which people would be excluded from claiming child benefit. I may not have understood the Minister's other replies, but I think that I understood his reply to that question. If parents have permanent residence, their child would be eligible for child benefit. If parents do not have permanent residence, the terms of their residence will determine whether their child is eligible for the benefit. I do not dispute that that is fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At least if we have done nothing else this afternoon, we have clarified that point. That will help some of the organisations that have raised points with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government were running around on the issue of spouses, students and post-graduate dentists and doctors. Either a mistake was made in August, and they failed to clarify the categories or they wondered how to include more content in the immigration rules, and someone discovered an anomaly. It is feared that the rules may be used in a damaging way and that the Home Secretary will be prevented from using the discretion that he can currently employ.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a moment of light the Minister said that the Home Secretary still had discretion under the regulations. If that is so, why have the regulations been introduced? Why have the immigration rules been changed? It makes organisations such as the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
Government helped to fund, suspicious of the Government's motives. The Minister's answer did not clarify matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall read the record to ascertain properly whether some clarification about the revocation of entry clearances was given. No one in Committee would dispute that the Home Secretary should have the authority to exclude from residence in this country persons whose presence would not be in the public good. Immigration rules should reinforce that authority. I hope that the Government's motives are genuine, and that they have not changed the regulations for some other purpose that we cannot identify. Suspicions exist, and they should be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Government to quantify some of the problems on which they based the changes in the regulations. It was a reasonable question. I hope that, when the Home Office claims that there are irregularities and problems, some quantification exists on which to base changes. It is wrong to ask Parliament to make changes when we do not know the extent of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I asked about the number of abuses, the Minister said that approximately 2,000 Nigerians claimed social security benefit fraudulently. The Minister knows from my contributions to our discussions on the Asylum and Immigration Bill that I support the eradication from our society of those abuses and the attendant criminality. The claimants are often victims of the process. However, that is not relevant to the subject of our discussion and I hope that the Government will not make such a justification for the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
The Opposition would not dispute the changes if they had been made for commonsense reasons that arose from previous decisions of the House. However, I am not sure that that is the case. I want to reflect on the matter by reading the record of our proceedings. I may then be able to respond to the representations that were made to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows, regulations do not exist forever; they are subject to regular change. If the Government abuse the changes that the regulations make, there will be pressure for further changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
