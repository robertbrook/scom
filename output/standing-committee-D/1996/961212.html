Sixth Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation</div> <!-- title -->

Draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Europe Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States and the Republic of Lithuania) Order 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Sir Nicholas Bonsor)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>"That the Committee has considered the draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Europe Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States and the Republic of Lithuania) Order 1996.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Europe Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States and the Republic of Latvia) Order 1996 and the draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Europe Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States and the Republic of Estonia) Order 1996.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The draft Orders in Council specify the agreements as European Treaties under section 1(3) of the European Communities Act 1972. They are mixed competence agreements—in other words, some of their provisions fall within Community competence and others fall within the competence of member states. They therefore require ratification by all European Union member states and the assent of the European Parliament before they can enter into force. In the case of the United Kingdom, the draft orders need to be approved by both Houses so that we may ratify the agreements.<br><br>
Much has happened since 1989, when the fall of communism in central and eastern Europe led to the historic opportunity to reunite the whole family of Europe. The European Union has been pursuing new relationships with the countries formerly behind the iron curtain and those countries have themselves been working hard towards EU membership—none more so than the Baltic states since they regained their independence. The United Kingdom has been one of their strongest supporters, offering through the know-how fund a valuable contribution to the transition process. Within the European Union, we have striven to create the conditions which will lead, via the pre-accession strategy agreed by the European Council at Essen in December 1994 and through the support of the PHARE programme, towards membership for all countries with Europe agreements.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
The agreements before us today are vital to the process of EU enlargement. Through them, the European Union and its member states will build a closer relationship with the Baltic states, increasing trade and economic co-operation, engaging in political dialogue, and opening up co-operation across the whole range of the EU's business.<br><br>
Let me list some of the ways in which the agreements will help Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania prepare themselves to take up their rightful place in the new Europe: firstly on trade liberalisation, the most practical way to ensure economic development is to open our markets to their goods. The agreements contain important provisions to facilitate that and, in turn, will help provide new commercial and investment opportunities to United Kingdom firms operating in the Baltic states.<br><br>
Secondly, the heading of economic and sectoral cooperation covers a wide range of sectors from education and agriculture to nuclear safety and consumer protection.<br><br>
Thirdly, on financial co-operation, the EU's PHARE programme has, for some years, provided technical assistance to help develop the political and economic structures of the associate countries. That help will continue under the agreements.<br><br>
Fourthly, to help start the process of integration, the agreements will help the three countries bring their legislation closer to existing EC standards. The associate countries have already embarked on that task, guided by the White Paper which the Commission issued last year.<br><br>
Finally, the agreements establish a forum for political dialogue between the leaders of the European Union and the associate countries. The Association Councils, as they will be called, meet once a year at ministerial level to review the agreements and build on them. The agreements also provide for meetings at head of Government level and for close consultation on foreign policy at senior level.<br><br>
As with the six central European countries whose Europe agreements are already in force, we look forward to building through the Europe agreements a path for the Baltic states to full and active membership of the European Union. We will continue to support and assist Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania along the way, just as we will continue to be the foremost supporters of enlargement to include all of the associated countries of central and eastern Europe. The agreements before us today are vital to that process. I commend the orders to the House.</span></p>
<p>10.34 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Joyce Quin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gateshead, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition welcome the agreements with the three countries, which are part of the developing relationship between the European Union and various central and eastern European countries. I welcome the Minister's approach, and I agree with his comments—it is good to be able to say that at a time when Europe is such a controversial subject. Two subjects that unite the House, and which are in the long-term interests of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0494">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
Europe, are the need to create good relationships with the countries of central and eastern Europe and the need to support enlargement.<br><br>
I agree with the Minister's remark that we are discussing mixed competence agreements. Although I do not want to delay the Committee unnecessarily, I have one or two questions about the way in which those agreements were negotiated. Having examined the documents, I notice that there is little difference between the three agreements. Were any specific difficulties encountered during the negotiations? I notice, for instance, that agriculture is included in the agreements—did that subject cause difficulties either to the European Union or to any of the three countries? Are those three countries generally content with the agreements and the concessions that they won on, for example trade? What opportunities will the agreements offer to British businesses? We have been developing trade with those three countries, so what further developments are likely to occur?<br><br>
The agreements provide an important channel for political dialogue between us and the three countries. In the years leading up to a closer relationship with—or even membership of—the European Union, political dialogue on a regular basis is important. What political dialogue has the Minister taken part in so far? Have the EU and the three countries discussed subjects that occasionally cause problems, such as minority rights in the three countries? I was interested to see yesterday a television interview with Max van der Stoel—the minority rights representative for the Organisation on Security and Co-operation in Europe—in which he discussed Russian minorities in the Baltic states. Obviously, minority groups should feel that they have a stake in the future of those countries. That matter should be tackled in a positive and constructive way that does not cause difficulties. I should welcome any information that the Minister can give me about the matter.<br><br>
I welcome the fact that the agreements also contain provisions stating that Latvian, Lithuanian and Estonian workers who are employed in EU countries should be treated in the same way as EU nationals. However, it is ironic that the Government are so willing to accept such social provision in association agreements with third countries when they strongly resisted the posted workers directive in the EU, which would have given British employees the same terms and conditions when they work in other EU countries. As a good geordie, I always call that the "Auf Wiedersehen, Pet" directive. The Government strongly resisted, even though they seem happy—and so are we—to allow nationals from African states and associate agreement countries the same social and employment rights when they work in European Union countries as the nationals of those European countries.<br><br>
The Opposition welcome the agreements and would not want to oppose them. The Minister said that the European Parliament must give its assent. Will the Minister tell us whether that assent has been or is soon to be given? What stage are other European countries at in the ratification process? Having discussed the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
agreements with the Latvian, Estonian and Lithuanian Governments I know that those countries are anxious for the agreement to come into force as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p>10.40 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) asked whether there were any difficulties relating to such factors as agriculture. There were not. The negotiations in the treaties went smoothly, although there are some differentials because of the different levels of advance that the three countries have made. With agriculture, it has been easier to negotiate the levels of support or tariff that are maintained in some areas and not in others.<br><br>
We were keen to give greater concessions to agricultural products from the countries than the European Union was able to agree to. That is a matter for regret. We want full integration and the removal of ther remaining tariff restrictions as soon as possible.<br><br>
In general, however, the agreements are excellent and very much in the interest of EU members and the Baltic states. All three states are happy with the outcome. I have visited Estonia and Lithuania and hope to visit Latvia early in the new year. In the conversations that I have had so far, the only concern expressed was why we had not ratified the agreements sooner and whether there were any problems. I was pleased to be able to reassure Baltic Ministers that there was no problem and that I did not anticipate any from the Committee. I am confident that we shall process the agreements and I am grateful to the hon. Lady for expressing her support.<br><br>
The hon. Lady also asked me about the opportunities for trade within the three countries. Estonia was able to offer unrestricted free trade to British and other EU imports from day one of the agreement. That is welcome. The other two countries have specific difficulties and it will take time for some barriers to be removed. There is enormous opportunity for United Kingdom trade. Our trade with those countries has dramatically increased: in every case it has more than doubled over the past 12 months.<br><br>
Our exports to Estonia in 1995 were £29.7 million compared with £15.3 million in 1994—a 90 per cent. increase. That encouraging trend has continued in the first nine months of this year. Our exports to Latvia were £40.058 million in 1995 compared with £30.696 million a year earlier—a 30 per cent. increase. This year the figure for the nine months is £62.487 million—an increase of 155 per cent. on the previous year. Those are extremely good figures. I should be able to give similar figures for Lithuania but I cannot find them at the moment. Perhaps I could return to that subject in a minute—certainly, the trade with that country has also been extremely promising.<br><br>
Trading relations between the UK and the Baltic states are fine. British business men have many opportunities there. The Government's only problem is to get those business men sufficiently interested to go there to find out what those opportunities are. I hope
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0495">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
that our embassies in each of the Baltic states and that their embassies here will do everything to ensure those opportunities are fully exploited.<br><br>
Exports to Lithuania amounted to £49.435 million in 1995 compared with £24.080 million in 1994—a 105 per cent. increase. The opportunities for British business are demonstrably strong in all cases.<br><br>
The hon. Lady also asked about political dialogue. As I told the Committee, I was in Lithuania and Estonia earlier this year. The political dialogue was excellent in both countries. The interest in the relationship with the UK expressed by the Governments of Lithuania and Estonia was strong. The old and historic ties will be easily reknotted. We will be able to encourage greater knowledge of each other's countries, and I look forward to strong and continuing political dialogue between our Government and theirs.<br><br>
There is good news on minority rights. The hostility to the Russian population was understandable given the way in which the Soviet Union behaved, especially in Estonia and Latvia where a high number of Russians still live. That hostility is going, and the OSCE has or is about to have missions in Estonia and Latvia, the latter having recently agreed to such a mission. in both cases, legislation with regard to minority rights is in place, or has been put in place, and has been approved by the OSCE and the Council of Europe. Enormous efforts are being made by the Governments of those counties to ensure that minority rights are protected. The hostility, which will take a little time to work through if people are to live next door to each other and co-operate, is improving.<br><br>
The hon. Lady also mentioned workers' rights. I refuse to be drawn into debating her only controversial remark. I am aware that both sides of the House do not agree, but I welcome the fact that full rights are offered to Baltic workers who come to this country. It is correct that we do everything we can to encourage
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Baltic business men to set up and operate here. We are on the right track in all cases and the European agreements are correct.<br><br>
The agreements have been ratified by six countries—Germany, Denmark, Finland, Austria, Ireland and Sweden. The European Parliament has not yet done so and full ratification will probably take about a year. I am glad that we have moved forward on this matter and I will welcome the day when the United Kingdom can say that the agreements have been ratified, which should be soon.</span></p>
