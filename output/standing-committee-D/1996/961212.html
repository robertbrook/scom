Draft Magistrates Courts (Remands in Custody) (Amendment) Order 1997</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Timothy Kirkhope)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Magistrates Courts (Remands in Custody) (Amendment) Order 1997.</p></blockquote>
I shall not take more than a few moments to introduce the order. It provides that section 128A of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980, which enables magistrates to remand defendants in custody for up to 28 days, shall have effect in all petty sessions areas in England and Wales in relation to those aged under 17 as well as those aged 17 and over.<br><br>
The order is a consequence of section 52 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996. Some Members may recall that that provides that sections 128 (1A) and (3A), and section 128A of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980, shall apply to defendants aged over 17. The effect is that the maximum length of time for which courts may remand in custody a juvenile under 17 who is awaiting summary trial or committal to Crown court will be in line with that for older defendants. That means that when a juvenile appears for a second or subsequent time in court, the court may order a remand in custody for a period of up to 28 days, rather than eight days as at present.<br><br>
As I have said, this order brings into effect the change to section 128A by providing that section 128A will have effect in all petty sessions areas in relation to those under the age of 17. Section 128A already has effect in these areas in relation to those aged 17 and over. We intend to bring the amendments into effect on 1 February by means of a separate appointed day order.<br><br>
It might be helpful if I briefly run over the thinking behind section 52. Frequent court appearances where no change in remand arrangements is sought can be disruptive for young people and the authorities as well as being unproductive. The new arrangements in section 52 will give courts greater flexibility in determining the appropriate remand period and reduce the number of adjourments. Courts will remain free to set shorter remand periods than the maximum if they consider it desirable, and defendants will be able to make bail applications before the end of remand period if there is a change in circumstances.<br><br>
We shall issue guidance to the courts and to other criminal justice agencies to make sure that the new arrangements and the flexibility that they provide are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
fully understood. It will, in particular make clear that the welfare of the child must be considered in determining the appropriate remand period.<br><br>
The order has already been approved in another place and, if it is approved by the Committee this morning, the Home Secretary will sign it and it will come into operation on 1 February. I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>10.33 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has already gone some way to answering the main point I want to raise—that is, the advice that will be given to the courts on the exercise of the new power. I should be grateful if he would develop that point further to assure me that the advice will include pressure on those involved in the courts to keep to a minimum the length of time before cases are disposed of.<br><br>
I agree with the Minister that it is disruptive and pointless to bring young people back to court when it is obvious to everyone that there will be a further remand. I do not object to the measure before us, therefore, but require reassurance that it will not be misused as a way to lengthen remands.<br><br>
The Minister rightly said that the order brings the provisions in line with those for other defendants. It is important that delays should be kept to a minimum and disposals be speedy for young offenders. For them more than for others, justice delayed is justice denied.<br><br>
Does the Minister agree that the practice of remanding 15 and 16-year-olds in custody should be kept to a minimum? If the Minister agrees, and tells us about the advice that will be given to courts, that will ensure that the Committee sends out a message about avoiding unnecessary delays.<br><br>
What will the Government do to speed up justice and thus ensure that the use of the power is kept to a minimum? We should not simply send a negative message from the Committee; we should also give a positive message about speeding up the youth justice system. The Opposition have pressed for that for a long time.<br><br>
Will the Minister speak about the places in which the young people will be remanded? Does the Minister recall that, in February 1991, the then Minister of State assured me that the practice of remanding young people aged 15 and 16 in adult prisons would end? The Minister tabled an amendment during the Committee proceedings of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 to grant the Government power to end that. The right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker), who was then Home Secretary, promised that secure places would be provided. However, the situation remains the same. Young people are remanded in adult prison accommodation or local authority care, which means inappropriate local authority community homes which were designed for different purposes. The promise was given almost six years ago, but the additional places have not been found, Indeed, there are fewer secure places.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0548">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
My reservation about the Government's failure to activate the clause that Parliament agreed during the passage of the 1991 Act is not a reason for opposing the order. However, those questions need to be tackled now that we are agreeing to extend the remand period.</span></p>
<p>10.38 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bob Dunn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dartford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I declare an interest, in that my wife serves as a magistrate on the Dartford Bench. The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) said that justice delayed was injustice. No one would disagree with that.<br><br>
However, the Minister said that the order, which I welcome, would be effective in all magistrates courts across the country. For that to happen, there must be magistrates courts in which the order is to be effective. Can the Minister assure me that there are no further plans to rationalise courts in north-west Kent or to remove the Dartford magistrates court? I agree with the maxim about justice delayed, but justice must also be accessible and visible locally.<br><br>
Will the Minister consider, separately from the debate, the need to construct a magistrates courthouse in the centre of the new Thames Gateway development? As a result of that development, a million people will come through Kent every week, perhaps every day. Thirty thousand new residents, schools, homes, doctors' practices, places of work and leisure must be catered for. It is sometimes difficult for people who find themselves on the wrong side of the law and their families to gain access to courts elsewhere. I hope, therefore, that the Minister can assure me that Dartford magistrates court is safe.</span></p>
<p>10.39 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir David Mitchell <span class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Hampshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: To follow the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Mr. Dunn) made, we too have problems in Hampshire with the closure of courts. I would be grateful for an assurance from the Minister about Andover and its court facilities.</span></p>
<p>10.40 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps before dealing with the interesting points raised by the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth, I should deal with those raised by my hon. Friends. I cannot give the assurances that they seek, because the matter is one for which the Lord Chancellor's Department has reponsibility. However, I shall ensure that my hon. Friends' remarks are passed to the Minister responsible, for action and response. I appreciate that it is important for our magistracy to be allowed to operate effectively, and for local justice to be seen to be done, as was intended when the system was set up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir David Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that no threat is posed to the court services in Winchester, but that in Andover, which has a larger population than Winchester's, they are under threat? Does he agree that past prestige is no ciriterion for judging current need?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will understand that although that point would be interesting to debate, I have no powers to give a direct answer on the merits of an individual case. I am sure that my colleagues at the Lord Chancellor's Department will pay attention to my hon. Friend's additional remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's difficulty, but his hon. Friends have raised good points concernig matters that have arisen in various parts of the country, including Staffordshire. I have learned about them on visits to the county. The matter is not just the responsibility of the Lord Chancellor's Dept, because the additional costs fall on police, witnesses and the legal aid system. I hope that the Minister will take seriously what hon. Members have said, and not just leave matters to the Lord Chancellor's Department, which does not seem to take into account—or help magistrates courts committees to take into account—the impact of costs on all parties involved, including the Department itself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is extremely kind of the hon. Gentleman to make those proposals, which I shall bear in mind. It is important, in relation to the order that we are considering, that justice should be seen to be done and should be as efficient and speedy as possible.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth probably heard me say, at Home Office questions, that guidelines to courts have been issued by the Magistrates Association and the Justices' Clerks Society, to try to ensure that, in future, cases in progress against young people should proceed without waiting for full investigation of further charges that might be under consideration. On of the biggest problems, with which I am familiar from my own legal experience, is that sometimes a case against a young person that is ready to be heard does not proceed because others are pending. That situation is all too prevalent in the case of a small number of regular offenders. It is important to speed matters up and deal effectively with the worst offenders so that their cases should be concluded quickly. The guidelines will be a great help in any event.<br><br>
The point of the order is to provide sufficient flexibility and to stop the waste of resources. It is in the interests of young people—and of justice—that their cases should be dealth with quickly. Having to return to court every eight days during what might be a long period of investigation seems ridiculous. We therefore proposed the rule changes, which are also in the interests of young people.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth asked me about the content of the guidelines to which I referred. I assure him that they will contain references to the child's general welfare and to the need to progress as quickly as possible.<br><br>
On remand places, obviously we regret that young people have to be detained in a secure place. But, sadly, for a small number of them there is no alternative. It is true that we made it clear in 1991 that we wanted remand to prison for boys—we are talking only of boys; girls do not go through the prison system at that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0549">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
age. We would like boys to go to other secure accommodation but this depends greatly on places being available in local authority secure accommodation. The hon. Gentleman rightly said that there have not been a sufficient number of such places. He said that they are diminishing—but places are now being created. We are working hard at this and when we have achieved capacity we hope to implement that part of the 1991 legislation.<br><br>
The welfare of young people is important, but so is the welfare of the community and the protection of society. If at the same time we can improve flexibility and cut costs that must be good news. The orders will do that. I hope that the Committee accepts them.</span></p>
<p>10.46 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the guidelines to courts will effectively state that the longer period allowed by the order should be used as intended and that those who manage cases have no reason to relax their efforts to have them dealt with as quickly as possible. That is the right message to convey, and I am grateful to the Minister for it.<br><br>
I agree wholeheartedly with the Under-Secretary about strengthening the will of courts to reject defence pleas in relation to catching up. I have spent much time over the years listening to sometimes persuasive sob stories about how allowing catching up would mean
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
greater efficiency. Occassionally there are reasons for doing this, but more often than not it merely adds to the delay and means that intervention in the life a defender comes more slowly, and hence less effectively. I hope that I can encourage the Minister by pressing that point; and I welcome his advice to the courts.<br><br>
I understand the Minister's point about work continuing on the provision of additional secure places. However, it has been going on for almost six years during which other places that existed then have become no longer available; whether this is temporary or permanent varies from place to place. The effect is that, in terms of day to day practice, the number of secure places available for 15 and 16-year-olds as an alternative to prison has diminished. The additional places promised in 1991 have not been made available. This is partly a cross-departmental problem, because not just the Home Office is involved—although the Home Secretary gave the promise. Cross-departmental arrangements should allow a promise made by the holder of such a senior office to be kept.<br><br>
Important though these issues are, they do not merit calling the order into question. I am happy to leave the debate there, in the hope that the Minister has taken note of the points made to him.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Magistrates Courts (Remands in Custody) (Amendment) Order 1997.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at eleven minutes to Eleven o'clock.</i></p>
