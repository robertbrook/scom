	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. At a previous sitting, the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) mentioned a school in my constituency—which was, in fact, Dover college although the hon. Gentleman did not identify it. He claimed that the school
	<br><blockquote><p>"had below average GCSE results".—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 19 November 1996; c. 36]</p></blockquote>
He said that the money under the assisted places scheme was not achieving what it was set up to achieve. I wish to place on record that in 1995, the pass rate for Dover college pupils was 63 per cent., whereas the average pass rate was 41·9 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Devonport is not in Committee at present and the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. O'Hara, may I point out that what the hon. Gentleman said was an error. It was a disgraceful slur on Dover college—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>RELAXATION OF CONTROLS ON CHANGES RELATING TO SELECTIVE ADMISSIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Yardley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 1, line 18, after "county", insert "secondary".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 31, in page 2, line 3, after "voluntary", insert "secondary".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I welcome you, Mr. O'Hara, to your first sitting of the Committee. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) is pleased to have another scouser in the Committee, and we are pleased to have a Chairman who has a long record of interest in education and who, as we already know, will deal with our proceedings in a firm but fair manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will be pleased that I do not intend to take a long time in speaking to the amendments because many of the arguments that were made when we discussed the previous amendment
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
apply to these amendments—although more strongly. Amendments Nos. 30 and 31 would remove from the Bill the right of a primary school to select. The Minister says that he regards the Bill as a permissive rather than prescriptive measure, but it would be the first, if it were made into law, to enshrine a primary school's right to select its pupils by ability or aptitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be a wrong move. All our previous arguments about the dangers of taking away parental choice, of labelling children too easily and of destroying the community aspects of many of our schools are even more forceful when we compare primary schools with secondary schools. Some Members of the Committee would argue that there has been a call from some quarters for a return to selection at the secondary stage, but I disagree with that. There has certainly been no call for the introduction of selection at the primary stage. There is no strong lobby of parents or others that selection should be introduced at the primary stage. The argument that there is cannot be advanced in favour of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Real problems exist about whether we can determine the ability or aptitude of a child who is as young as five or seven. At our previous sitting, the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) described how the system failed to predict his ability and how it deemed him an academic failure at the age of 11. He then went on to great things, which shows how difficult it is to test aptitude and ability at the age of 11. It would be even more difficult to test a child's aptitude and ability at the ages of five or seven. To label children and to put them into one form of schooling at those ages could damage them in their later years of schooling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we regard schools as part of the community. They are sometimes the only institution in a district that can support and offer facilitites to the community. At the primary level, there is a strong notion of community. Most parents choose to send their children to the local school. The Bill will potentially deny them that right. If demand exceeds supply, criteria will have to be introduced on which children should have the right to go to a particular school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right of children to go to their local school is fundamental. We are talking about stability—the stability that comes from children going to school with their neighbours' children, from not having far to travel and from being able to identify with the school buildings. Taking that away from children at the age of five, six or seven would destroy that stability. It will do nothing to buttress the feeling of community. We talk a lot these days about the need to guard and strengthen communities. Taking away a child's right to attend the local school will do nothing to support the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the provision remains unamended, I believe that few schools will choose to use it. There is no demand for it. Parents will jealously guard their right to send their youngest children to the local school, with their brothers and sisters and the neighbours' children. We should not underestimate the strength of feeling
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
for local primary schools. I believe that parents will do all that they can to make sure that that option remains for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as long as that provision remains in the Bill, schools might choose to deal with the problem of demand exceeding supply by selecting on ability or aptitude. We have a duty to protect the right of parents to send their children to the local primary school—the school that is nearest; the one that the child and neighbours identify with; the one that is easiest to travel to; the one that is part of the community in which the child will live during those important early years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments will ensure that parents retain the right to send their children to the local school. I therefore hope that they will find support in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. O'Hara, to the Chair. I am sure that you, like your co-Chairman, will be extremely wise in overseeing our proceedings—to borrow a phrase used last week, that you will be "judicious".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris). Selecting and labelling children at the age of five is plain daft. It is a grotesque indictment of our education system and its potential to improve the outcome for children to start thinking of children of that age as successes or failures. It is grotesque also in that it would write off 70 per cent. or 80 per cent. of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree that children should be assessed at the age of five. When we reach the clauses that deal with that point, there will be cross-party support for the proposal. The reason for making such assessments is that schools would then know what children were capable of and thus how to develop those abilities to their full potential. One would also be able to measure a school's effectiveness in achieving the best for its pupils. Such assessment would allow schools to add value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday, I visited a nursery school in Northampton. Children there are being assessed at the age of three on such criteria as emotional, social and physical development, speaking and listening skills, early literacy, writing and mathematical skills and observational skills. That is extremely sensible, as it enables the school to assess at an early stage whether it is important to intervene because the child might have special needs—in that school, 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. of the children have special needs. It also enables the staff—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would be more content if there were only one debate in the Room at any one time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that it is difficult to listen to common sense. Judging children at five is daft; I would argue that it is also grotesque.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
Another matter arising from our debate last week is the 11-plus, and I wonder how many members of the Committee remember just what it was like. I do not know whether many of them sat the exam, but I remember it. It tested not so much one's ability or one's potential, but whether one could do the particular tasks that were set in that particular test—nothing more, nothing less. Those of us who sat the 11-plus were coached for months and months in the run-up to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If our parents could afford it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant coached by our teachers. It is worth reminding the Committee of the absurdity of the test. In February, Professor Wragg wrote in 	<i>The Times Educational Supplement—[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is early in my first sitting as Chairman. I am doing my best to follow the considered arguments of the hon. Lady. I understand that it may sometimes be necessary on both sides of the Room to have discrete discussions in preparation for debate, but they should not be so loud as to disrupt the Committee, and I suggest that members of the Committee conduct other discussions outside the Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall read out one question that I imagine Professor Wragg himself faced when he took the 11-plus some 30 or 40 years ago. It asked:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it takes 10 minutes to fill a bath with the plug in, and five minutes to empty it with the plug out, then how long would it take to fill five baths and empty them, one after the other?"</p></blockquote>
[	<i>Interrupton.</i>] I am sure that it would help us perform our task as Members of Parliament to be able to answer that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Wragg then imagines the modern version of that question, which I shall share with the Committee. I shall not repeat it all, as it contains some unparliamentary language, but it asks:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it takes seven education ministers 17 years to"</p></blockquote>
something up
	<br><blockquote><p>"most of the education system, how long will it take one prime minister to screw up all of it?"</p></blockquote>
Conservative Members think that such absurd questions offer a good way to improve standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for introducing selection—be it at 11 or be it, more frighteningly, at five—has nothing to do with a concern for raising standards, promoting equality or ensuring opportunities for all; it has everything to do, I believe, with cheap and silly politics in the run-up to a general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality is this, and I quote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"England's long standing problem is the long tale of underachievement with the less able. It is difficult to see how a return to selection will help to tackle this…Policy must be geared to raising standards for all, and not to providing escape routes for a few…It is a common misconception that diversity and choice are complementary."</p></blockquote>
All Opposition members of the Committee agree with those statements; I should be interested to know whether any Conservative members of the Committee concur with them. They were made by the Conservative Education Association—a group that I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>87</span>
would have thought most people accept as being experts in education, and which has as president, vice-president and patrons among a number of distinguished Members of the House, including the Chairman of the Select Committee on Education and Employment. The statements demonstrate the thinking of Conservatives who are concerned about education; they also illustrate the Government's hypocrisy in pretending a sudden conversion to selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Secretary of State feels incredibly uncomfortable with the proposals that have been foisted upon her by the Prime Minister, and which she had to front on Second Reading. We all know from her record as a councillor in Norfolk that she played a key role in closing all grammar schools in Norfolk—not only did she sit as a member of the education committee, she was strongly involved in the campaign for their closure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has made the Government change their mind? We have had no answer to that question. Why have the Government changed their mind after years and years during which all educationalists across the political spectrum believed comprehensive education to be the best way to organise our schools to ensure that every child had an equal opportunity to achieve his or her best? Nobody can answer that question. As late as 1994, when the Secretary of State had already taken up her position, she said in a meeting with teachers in Norfolk that as long as she was in charge, nothing would change. Yet it has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not a single organisation sympathetic to the Conservative party supports the Government's proposals. Let us consider the evidence provided by grant-maintained schools in response to the consultation document. They stated that they
	<br><blockquote><p>"would resent changes in the admission arrangements to neighbouring schools that would distort the current level playing field."</p></blockquote>
The Funding Agency for Schools has also said that selection would not help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider what a number of Conservative local education authorities have said. In its evidence to the Select Committee on Education and Employment, Westminster education authority said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"By giving schools greater freedom to select pupils, one could be seen to be diminishing parent's rights to select schools. Consequently, the result of this could be fewer rather than more satisfied parents."</p></blockquote>
Bromley education authority, which has more grant-maintained schools than any other local authority, has also said that an increase in selection will have a devastating effect on its ability to house the people who live in the borough, and who therefore should have right of access to a school in the borough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
I am sure that, by Second Reading, all members of the Committee had received a briefing that includes a quotation from a disabled woman. She raises a key issue that we have so far only touched on, and says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Children will only learn about equality, social justice and respect for one another if they are educated together. It would not be acceptable for a school to select pupils on the colour of their skin and sex so the same principle must be applied for disabled children which includes children with learning difficulties.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Many children with learning difficulties may not sit examinations and if they do will not gain the same grades as their peers. As a consequence these children may not be selected on their ability and aptitude.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Where is the equality if a local authority and grant maintained school selects?</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>If an LEA school decides to select 20 per cent. of their pupils then a child with learning difficulties will only have an 80 per cent. chance of attending the school whilst a child without learning difficulties will have a 100 per cent. chance.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I believe increased selection in mainstream schools whether that is in the grant maintained or local authority means increased segregation of children with learning difficulties.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Parents and children with learning difficulties will have less choice than parents and children without learning difficulties."</p></blockquote>
That is the most resounding indictment, and it is why the proposals to increase selection and the number of secondary modern schools are dire and backward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make one or two points about issues that have not been dealt with before—although the Minister probably will not respond to them because he does not have the answers. Last week, he argued that the schools surrounding a selective school performed better. I looked at some of the evidence that supported that claim, and I did not find it convincing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall use three examples. Kent has many grammar schools and selection in its schools, but only 43.7 per cent. of the cohort in Kent gained five or more A to C-grade GCSEs. Essex also has grammar schools and, similarly, only slightly more than 43 per cent. of its cohort gained five A to C-grade GCSEs. However, Hampshire has no selective schools and a similar socio-economic structure—the Minister must be the only person in the world who believes that to be totally irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They do keep on. I will say that the results in Islington are not at all good. If anyone were to look at my record and the statements that I made when I was leader, they would see that I often said that the quality of education on offer to children in Islington was poor. Sadly, for most of the time that I was a counciller in Islington, the control of education lay with the Inner London education authority. I say that for the benefit of ignorant Conservative Members. One of my great personal regrets is that I had only two years when I was leader to start tackling the issue of low standards in that authority. Had I had longer, we would undoubtedly have done far more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Hampshire, with its similar socio-economic grouping to both Kent and Essex, 46.5 per cent. of the year's cohort got five GCSEs in grades A to C. Hampshire has comprehensive education and does not have selection. Therefore, if falls on the Government to state clearly their evidence that returning to a system of secondary modern and grammar schools will raise the standards for all children in a particular locality. The evidence from having existing grammar schools shows that that is not the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The figures show that 56 per cent. of children got five or more A to C-grades, which suggests that selection does work and raises standards all round.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that Conservative Members find it difficult to accept my argument. In selecting the three county councils to which I referred, I had regard to their similar socio-economic groupings, thereby making a fair analysis of how the different organisations of schooling impacts on the standards achieved by children. I know that that is an extremely difficult concept for the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Lady Olgar Maitland) to grasp. Perhaps she would understand it if her area were to return to comprehensive schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may assist the Committee to know that in Solihull, where the education system has been non-selective since 1971—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, my hon. Friend reminds us that it is now a Labour council. It had been a Conservative council for many years, and is probably rather similar to Sutton and Cheam. Nearly 50 per cent. of children in Solihull get five A to C grades. I note that the figure for Arden comprehensive school, which I know well, is 86 per cent. It is a non-selective school and does better than many of the independent selective schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for those figures. I have another statistic to give the Committee regarding Rugby county school, which is a secondary modern next to a grammar school. In that county council, 53 per cent. of the children in the cohort get five GCSEs A to C grades. But, the secondary modern school—Rugby county—has an abysmal performance, with only 13 per cent. of children reaching A to C grades. That is another fact—an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
uncomfortable one perhaps to Conservative Members—showing that a return to secondary modern schools, which the Bill is about, will lower standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two other issues, which have not been discussed in our extensive debates on the principle of selection both at secondary and, absurdly, at primary level. Conservative Members say that selection will increase choice, but we have argued consistently that that is nonsense and that it will enable schools rather than parents to choose. The evidence is in the appeals system. appeals have escalated during a period when the Government have introduced so-called diversity with the purpose—they claim—of increasing choice. They have failed abysmally in increasing choice because more and more parents have failed to get their first choice. In 1989–90, there were only 21,000 appeals; in 1994–95, they had increased to 54,427. If this Government introduced the legislation to increase parental choice, they have—by their own figures—failed. The Opposition argue that greater selection would add to that failure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to another subject to which my hon. Friend the Member for Yardley referred. There is much talk at the moment about family values and the importance of holding a community together. The reality is that selection—whether absurdly at the age of five, or at 11—divides families and separates friends. To institutionalise such divisions and difficulties, in individual families or in communities, by introducing processes that prevent children from going to the schools of their choice and brothers and sisters attending the same school, would be a step backwards in terms of what I thought was a cross-party determination to strengthen communities and family life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is just daft. It is crazy that children should start being selected at the age of five; to write off the future of hundreds of thousands of children at 11 is crazy and to do it at the age of five even crazier. If the Government showed a little common sense, they would concur with the amendment to ensure that at least they do not start damaging the primiary sector in the way in which they have damaged the secondary sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is rather entertaining that the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) goes on about the Government's education policies, using freely such words as "daft" and "crazy", when they would be much more appropriately applied to Islington, where she used to look after education. When we refer to Labour areas like Islington and expose their total failure, all we seem to get back from Opposition Members are excuses that it was all ILEA's fault—yet Labour was in charge of ILEA and has been in charge of education in areas such as Islington for 25 years. It is amazing that any Opposition Member can confidently say anything about education when Labour has an appalling—in fact, absolutely dreadful—record on education. Even the hon. Lady is apt to admit that it is not good.

We want to achieve good benchmarks and good practice, and to ensure that schools that achieve success are the basis on which parents can choose.

The truth is that in 1995, the percentage of Dover college pupils obtaining five A to C-grades at GCSE was 63 per cent., compared with a local education authority average of 41.9 per cent. and an England average of 43.5 per cent.

We must establish the facts of the figures in 	<i>Hansard.</i> I was quoting the 1993 examination results for Dover college, which I have here, which show that only 40 per cent. of pupils gained five or more A to C-grades at GCSE. I am sure that members of the Committee are delighted that Dover college has raised its standards, especially as its
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
pupils are funded at twice the level of the LEA schools in the area. Indeed, it has improved to such an extent that it has even surpassed Hillview secondary modern school, where 50 per cent. of children gained five A to C-grades.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now that the hon. Gentleman accepts that the figure was 40 per cent., he should realise that in 1993, the Government were deciding which schools would remain on the assisted places list. I have the figures for 1995–96, which I quoted last year, which show that Dover college received £140,672 for 27 pupils under the assisted places scheme. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to do a little simple arithmetic, he will find that that is well in excess of £5,000 per pupil. So what I said was correct; I quoted the figures for the tables of 1993 and last year's figures for the number of children and the amount of money they received under the assisted places scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have no difficulty in opposing the amendment because what Labour is doing is deeply upsetting many Labour sympathisers in my constituency. Last week, I visited another school in my constituency—I go round

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>93</span>
the schools frequently. I find that although not all teachers support Conservative philosophy, Labour-sympathising teachers hate Labour using the word "failures". When I visit non-selective schools in my constituency, I find that they are proud of their successes; they are proud of sending pupils to Oxford and Cambridge; they are proud that they take pupils who have not passed the 11-plus and ended up at grammar schools—pupils whom they do not regard as failures—and make them successes in their own time and using their own abilities and skills. Those schools deeply resent Labour using the word "failures"; they do not like it, and nor do the parents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will tell the hon. Gentleman; that has already happened in my constituency.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will have to disappoint Opposition members of the Committee, because I have made the points that I wanted to make, and I want to hear from my hon. Friend the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I joint the hon. Member for Yardley in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. O'Hara. On the basis of the Committee's first two sittings, I can assure you that our proceedings so far this morning have been untypical. I think that you will find that we will quickly get into our stride.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the elegant and brief speech of the hon. Member for Yardley. She made her points succinctly; we understood them well and I will attempt to reply equally briefly, if not with the elegance that she displayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue before us is straightforward, and it is important to recall its context, which is that no distinction is made in the current legislative and regulatory regime between the secondary and primary sectors. That is important, because that system has operated perfectly well and satisfactorily to date and is reflected in the provisions of the Bill—with the exception that under the present regime, the guidelines
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>94</span>
allow a primary school to select upto 15 per cent. of its intake, whereas the Bill will increase that proportion to 20 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we are discussing the difference between a 15 per cent. and a 20 per cent. regime. That difference does not merit the amount of excitement that has been displayed this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister has no intention of misleading the Committee, but he will recognise that we are not just debating a 5 per cent. difference; we are also debating whether or not statutory proposals must be published—a critical issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, of course, underlies the philosophy of the whole Bill, but I was trying to concentrate on the primary argument advanced by Opposition Members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister know how many primary schools have exercised their right to select up to 15 per cent. of their pupils by ability or aptitude?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Lady asks me that question; I asked it of my officials yesterday in anticipation of our debate. The answer is that we do not know. By definition, schools that have exercised their discretion to select up to 15 per cent. of their pupils have not had to come to the bureaucracy and heavy hand of the Department for Education and Employment for permission. So—joyously, I might say—we do not know the answer, because we have made it none of our business. We want through the provisions of the Bill to make it further none of our business; that is the whole point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister actually saying that he writes policy without reference to those people who will be affected by it? He has no evidence about how many schools have exercised their right to select up to 15 per cent. of their pupils. Therefore, he does not know whether there is demand for the limit to be raised to 20 per cent. Is he really so isolated that he utterly ignores what those who are affected by his decisions have to say?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is missing the point. Time and again, in her brief and elegant speech, she displayed the dilemma that always faces Opposition Members. I have said before that they cannot decide whether to be worried about the huge impact of the freedoms that will result from the Bill, or whether to hope that so few schools will exercise the option that it will not make a hap'orth of difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have that problem. We want to give schools and communities that discretion and choice. We want to allow them to exercise discretion. It is not for me to make the sort of judgment that the hon. Lady invites me to make. In that regard only, I am able to display a degree of indifference that she may find difficult to understand, but with which I am extraordinarily comfortable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why the Government have changed their view on comprehensive education at primary or secondary level?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware that the Government have ever changed their view on comprehensive education, but would it necessarily be a bad thing if we had? The hon. Lady may be trapped in an Islington time warp, but most of us are capable of moving on from time to time. In the House the other day, I mentioned the attitude of the Hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) in 1981 to school uniforms. For all I know, the hon. Gentleman may now take a different view of school uniform, which I would welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same spirit, the hon. Lady can surely accept that if there had been a change of view on comprehensive education, it might be welcome. However, I am not aware of a change of view on that subject. The hon. Lady seems to imagine that, years ago, Conservative Members were enamoured of comprehensive education and that we are now changing our view. Neither of those propositions is true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the 1980s and most of the 1990s, there appeared to be some consensus that comprehensive education was the best way in which to pursue equality of opportunity for most children. I reminded the Minister in my speech that as chairman of Norfolk education committee, the Secretary of State played a leading role in ensuring that the remaining grammar schools in the Norfolk county council area were closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not denying the Minister the right to change his mind; I am asking him to explain why he has changed his mind and why he thinks that selection at 11 or five will raise standards for all our children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether or not I have changed my mind does not matter. If any members of the Conservative party once thought that comprehensive education was successful and that a monolithic comprehensive education system was the best available, I would be quite happy to accept that they had changed their minds. We can demonstrate many times over, by the measures that we have taken to open education up in order to display its successes and its failures, that monolithic comprehensive education has disgracefully let down generations of pupils, not least in Islington. If there has been a change of mind among Conservative Members, that is why it has taken place. I should have thought that that was obvious, even to the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with another matter raised by the hon. Members for Yardley and for Barking. A little confusion seems to have arisen in their minds about baseline assessments. Either we can agree that it is perfectly feasible, possible and even desirable to assess a child at the age of five, or we must contend that that is impossible and undesirable. I get the impression from Opposition Members that the concept and practice of baseline assessment is now widely agreed as being
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>96</span>
achievable, practical and desirable. To the extent that that is so, it seems perfectly feasible that a school should be able to make an assessment of a child, even at the age of five. The non-feasibility argument has no legs, but the hon. Member for Yardley may be about to explain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's statement is important. The Secretary of State has given an assurance that baseline assessment will not be used as a means of selecting pupils at the age of five. What the Minister said seems to run counter to that. The notion of baseline assessment is that the abilities of children can be judged, so that one can identify the strengths and weaknesses of those children at five and work out what the school has added by the age of seven. Is he now saying that the Government intend that information garnered in baseline assessments can be used as a means by which primary schools can select children at five?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am saying something much simpler than that. Methodologically, it seems that the techniques are available to make an assessment of a child at five.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister understand that there is a difference between a technique that can evaluate the skills a child has at a particular point and one that can evaluate the child's potential? That is the problem. If a primary school chooses to select children at five on the basis of information from baseline assessment, all it is doing is selecting children on the skills that they have at that point, without regard to potential or future ability—that is what is damaging about selection for primary schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I am happy to accept that the technique used would have to be different—it would be in a school's interest for it to be different. I do not think that we need to fall out over that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we may have to fall out over that as it is serious. If the Minister now accepts that baseline assessment is not a suitable way for primary schools to select children at five, will he say what research he has carried out and what methods of selection he will recommend to primary schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot, as I am certainly not going to pre-empt any consultation that may take place on that. As the hon. Lady knows, we have insisted that extensive consultation be held on baseline assessment, and I am happy to say that that has been fruitful and positive. The process is well known and familiar, and there is no reason why it cannot be repeated. For Opposition Members to make heavy weather of alleged problems concerning selection at five runs counter to the emerging and welcome consensus on baseline assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe not only that the Bill's modest measures, which affect secondary and primary schools equally, are well founded in existing legislation and regulatory arrangements and practice—they do not make a significant difference to those—but that the problems that the hon. Lady suggested might arise because of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>97</span>
lack of demand are of no relevance, as the whole point of the provisions is to enable demand to find its own level. We are neither forcing demand nor resting our argument on it; we are saying that in so far as a reasonable demand is established, we want to make provision for satisfying it. That is the essence of the provision and, indeed, the whole Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Kilfoyle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Walton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that that is the essence of the provision. If so, will he now deal with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Yardley about the 15 per cent. leeway? How does one begin to evaluate the demand if one does not know what the current take-up is under the 15 per cent. leeway?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, we are, perhaps inevitably, at cross purposes. I do not need to assess the demand. Through the provision, we acknowledge the importance of local decision-making; we want to honour it and provide mechanisms through which it can be expressed. In that context, the extent of the demand is irrelevant. To give an extreme example, if there were an established demand from one school to go down that route, would not it be desirable to allow that demand to be met? I do not believe that the question, as expressed by the hon. Member for Walton, is relevant and I ask the Committee to oppose the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Other Committee members will want to speak about this and the Minister will have the chance to respond, but I ask simply whether he can tell us what evidence he has—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He will not respond now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There seems to be some confusion about what is happening. The Minister has sat down. There will be a short, I trust, clause stand part debate, when Committee members will be able to make that point to the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been interesting. It is clear that there is no demand for selection at primary schools—I have heard of no demand, and the Minister has made no attempt to establish whether there is a demand. We must oppose selection for primary schools because the action of one school will affect many other schools in the community. If there were a notion that we could let one school select and that that would not damage anyone else, the Minister's arguments might hold some sway. But that is not the case. If one school selects, many more will be affected. Therefore, we must ensure that primary schools are not allowed to select their intake on academic ability or aptitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the Minister does not have the faintest idea of whether or how primary schools can select on ability or aptitude. He has completely misunderstood the need and purpose of baseline assessment, which is damaging for the consensus that the Secretary of State has built up with schools, parents and local authorities. The fact that he sees it potentially as a way
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>98</span>
of selecting pupils at five and seven for primary schools is very damaging to the welcome consensus that has developed about baseline assessment.

We in the Opposition want to defend parents' rights to send their children aged five or seven to the nearest local school, to which the child's brothers and sisters and other children in the community go. It was interesting that when the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) intervened in the speech of the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw), he quickly finished his speech and did not say how he would explain to parents why he was removing their right to send very young children to the school nearest to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given the extended debate that there has been on a small number of amendments, I trust that members of the Committee will discipline themselves so that this debate will be relatively short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be disciplined. I want to make a brief point that is crucial to the debate about selection and which follows on from my hon. Friends' speeches, especially that of my hon. Friend the Member for Yardley whose two excellent contributions went straight to the heart of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was right: my hon. Friend the Member for Yardley was eloquent, but she was also right. She said that choice for one child and family can mean a reduction of choice and opportunity for another child and family. The Government, Ministers and Conservative Members have all failed to grasp that. They have certainly failed to respond to the points that we have put to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a child is given the opportunity to be selected for a place in a school that is full of children who come from the neighbourhood, it is self-evident that another child who would have attended it will be displaced and must go elsewhere. That child will have no choice. Children will be forced to accept schools other than those which they would have attended traditionally—the schools nearest their home where their siblings would have gone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point is especially pertinent to my constituency. I represent that part of Sheffield where the population is increasing and, therefore, the schools are generally full. There are four secondary schools in my constituency, one of which has just had a new annex built because it had been full. Two of the schools are full and can take no more pupils. The fourth school will be full in the next two or three years, according to demographic projections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the admissions policies of all those schools are related to the community, pupils' siblings and other connections with the area. But, if any of those schools went selective and chose children who were not from the locality, other children who were from the area eventually would have to be told that they could not have a place in their local comprehensive school. That is equally true for the primary schools in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Brookhouse and Brunswick—those names will not mean much to other Members of the Committee—are good local schools, and they are full. If the children who would naturally go to those schools were excluded because other children were brought in under selection, they would have to travel, according to Government policy, up to two miles to school. Given the topography of Sheffield, the point is even more pressing, as those children would have to travel up to four miles to attend another school with surplus places. It is unreasonable to ask primary children to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>100</span>
The Government have never dealt with the point that extra choice for one family—in reality, it is not the child or the parents who choose but the school—can mean less choice and opportunity for many other children. It is almost as though there is a merry-go-round—children are sent from one school to another. Instead of going to their neighbourhood school, children might apply to and, if selected, attend another school. Unless more places are created, that means that children who would traditionally attend that school must be sent to another school. Children will be shuffled around if selection is introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A rather bizarre game of musical chairs is another way of describing what will happen. At present, there are 100 chairs for children to sit on, but the Government suggest that schools can decide who sits on 20 of those chairs. If schools do so and bring in children who would not otherwise have gone to those schools and therefore would not have been allowed to sit on those chairs, the other 80 children—and perhaps others—will have to worry whether they will be allowed to sit on the chairs that will be left. There will be mad scramble among parents for a place in their local school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Selection will not be decided by academic ability. The process will mean eventually that children who do not meet the criteria will face the threat of not being able to attend the local school. They will lose out in the bizarre game of musical chairs. A school will be able to select children to sit on certain chairs, as a result of which there will not be enough chairs for other local children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not faced up to the opportunity of the measure, and it will be unpopular even though a small number of people will be in favour of it, given that some children will be selected for a place in a school that they otherwise would not have attended. It will not only be the children who are displaced at the end of process who will be opposed to the Government's policy; all parents will be worried that such selection might lead to their children not getting a place in their local school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should worry about the measure from a political as well as an educational point of view. Selection for a few can mean less choice for the many. That children will not be able to attend their local school under such a process is a matter that we shall continue to raise until we receive a sensible response to if from the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a few points to make on that theme. There is an inescapable conflict between school choice and parental choice. It is impossible to parade both choices as achievable. I explained earlier how parental choice is a big issue in my constituency because there has been a shortage of places in certain areas, given that several places are taken up by children from neighbouring districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) said, once selection is introduced, several places will be taken up on the basis of school selection, not parental choice. I find that the authority applies its judgement strictly in secondary schools. In Morley, a high proportion of children are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>101</span>
already selected regardless of geography, because they do not live in the district in which their school is situated. If schools also exercise selection under the clause, fewer places will be available for parents to choose. There is a complete contradiction between parental choice and school choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister is in favour of there being a grammar school in every town and he has done his best to engender interest in certain parts of the education world in secondary school selection. However, there is no evidence that anyone has shown a great interest in primary school selection. My hon. Friend the Member for Yardley made it clear that selection on the basis that the Minister is suggesting is likely to be damaging to children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth and my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) are proof that big mistakes are made by selection at the age of 11. As my hon. Friend the Member for Yardley said, selection at the ages of five or seven will be subject to innumerable mistakes. Selection is patently unreliable. Indeed, given the doubts about the statistical basis of selection, schools will select on the basis of whether they consider parents will give the children support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deal with the effects of choice at primary school level. There has been a shortage of primary school places in one part of my constituency. Overwhelmingly, when parents are upset it is because their children cannot get places at their local school; they must go to schools that it is difficult for parents to reach. Very young children are involved. Often parents take children even younger than the ones who attend school because they cannot leave them unattended. If we increase their journeys by not allowing their children to attend the local school, we impose great strain on families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I have handled appeals concerning primary school places, I have found that they are overwhelmingly caused by the shortage of places and because children are not able to go to their neighbourhood school—the school that could easily be reached through family arrangements. The only appeals that I have supported that have not been made on that basis have been in cases where working mothers have arrangements with child minders which mean that they want to use a particular school—perhaps one at which their child previously attended a nursery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the schools are to select, it is nonsense for them to select on the haphazard and ill-thought-out basis that the Minister proposes. I wanted to intervene on the Minister when he suggested that people had asked for the measures. Which reputable educational organisation has told the Department that it wants selection in primary schools? If the Minister cannot tell me of such an organisation, perhaps he can tell me of an individual school that has asked for selection. I have yet to hear any evidence that anybody except the Conservative party wants it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, as long as he does not labour that point excessively and too frequently. I do not consider that to be the problem that the hon. Gentleman considers it to be. In a sense, it does not matter how many schools have asked for the provision; we are giving them the opportunity, if they want to take it. Perhaps by giving them that opportunity, we may stimulate more interest—I do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members of the Committee should lighten up a bit. If nobody wants the provision, there is no problem for Opposition Members, and we can move on. If there is a huge demand out there, perhaps Opposition Members will feel uncomfortable, but I will be rather happy. Either way, we need not detain ourselves with the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is quite wrong. The Government have a responsibility not to offer choice where that choice will, if exercised, be damaging to others. If a primary school introduces choice, that will have a damaging effect on the parents and children who are unable to get places at the school and on neighbouring schools. It is all very well for the Government to say that they are willing to give people choices, but it is irresponsible of them to give people a choice that will be damaging to children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many mistakes will be made; the Minister has admitted that he does not even know what will be the basis for selection. Even if the choice is not taken up, it is quite wrong that the opportunity is being provided in the Bill. To the extent that the choice is taken up, it will damage the educational system, so it is not a choice that the Government should provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to stake out one or two points that relate to Wales. In Wales, we have no overtly or officially selective state schools. In one grant-maintained school, selection is occurring by back-door methods, but it is not officially sanctioned anywhere and, as far as I know, there is strong demand for it. Occasionally, head teachers have expressed an interest because the majority of them in an area have preferred to allow parental choice within a catchment area, but that is not the real issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Allowing schools to have a new and official way of becoming selective will add to uncertainties in the system and it will make it much more difficult for some schools to make improvements, under the current GCSE criteria. There are many schools in Wales that are trying to improve their performance, but if selection is introduced, some of those schools could find it more difficult to do so. In a school where about 20 per cent. of pupils get five GCSEs at grades A to C, parents may decide to send their children to other schools. By making that choice, the school could lose perhaps half of its best pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is imperative for the Government to ensure that all schools provide a good education for every pupil. Selection will make that more difficult. There is nothing happening in Wales that will make me support a clause that will introduce selection more widely into
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>103</span>
the system. It will create uncertainty and difficulties in the weaker schools which are trying desperately to improve standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very brief, Mr. O'Hara, as you know that selection is anathema to the Opposition. With your erudition, you will understand fully when I say that this measure is one tall poppy that we shall happily cut down when we are in Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could easily be distracted by the bile of the hon. Member for Dover, but he reveals the sclerosis at the heart of the Conservative party's thinking on selection. A particular faux pas was his reference to failure and his fear of the use of the word. No one likes to be talked of as a failure. Indeed, the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth misheard what was said in an earlier sitting and assured us that he was no failure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it is pointed out that selection implies that some will succeed, no matter what double speak or new speak the hon. Member for Dover uses, people will have a sense of failure. That sharpens up the awareness of the problems that people face under a selection system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was particularly taken by the Minister's comments. He has abdicated any interest in whether there is a take-up of the 15 per cent. in primary schools. He almost affected a sort of Maoist approach of allowing 1,000 flowers to bloom and went on to make comparisons with grant-maintained schools. He is suggesting that if there is no take-up, what is the worry? We should just make the options available and if people want them, they will take them. But that is not consistent with what the Government want to do. Time after time, they try to reinforce the position of grant-maintained schools and stack the deck in their favour. We shall see further evidence of that later in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key was when the Minister said that he had no idea how selection would be effected in primary schools. He has no interest, no idea and no way forward. The measure is just a shot in the dark that nobody wants. I have yet to be persuaded that anyone in the constituencies wants primary school selection. The Government are making the opportunity available without taking responsibility for the possible consequences, which my hon. Friends have so eloquently shown will be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For intellectual consistency if for no other reason, we shall have to press the matter to a vote. We shall vote against clause 1 stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have inevitably covered a lot of familiar ground. Nevertheless, I was grateful to the hon. Member for Attercliffe for giving me his political advice and protection. that was touching and I accept the gesture in the spirit in which it was offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Walton advised me that selection would be unpopular. That, I suppose, is a judgment that we all have to make. The hon. Gentleman obviously believes that by opposing selection, he and his hon. Friends will gain in political popularity and he warns me that I will lose political support if I proceed with the Bill. I stand duly warned.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>104</span>
I accept the fact that our judgments may differ. The electorate will obviously take that into account when the election arrives. However, it should not affect how we deal with the Bill in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have obviously judged that the principle of establishing a degree of diversity in the educational system is a good one. The historic position is that parents were forced to send their child to the nearest school regardless of what they wanted and, moreover, wealthier people could move into the area nearest to what they perceived to be a good school and thus buy that privilege for their child. Opposition Members rightly pointed out that moving away from that and giving parents an increased element of choice would mean that not all parents could have what they wanted. I accept that, but if Opposition Members are saying that to get around that problem they would go back to requiring all parents to send their children only to the nearest school, there will be disappointment in the system. Opposition Members should not pretend otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a travesty of the truth. Parents in Wales normally send their children to schools within a broad catchment area. However, parents have the right to send their children to other schools. To my knowledge, most parents in my constituency get the school that they want for their children. That is done without selection but with an element of parental preference; appeals can be made and the system seems to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 will add uncertainty to the sytem, making it more difficult for those schools that are striving to do better—those in the lower half of the league tables devised by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what Opposition Members always say. Whenever we introduce something new or different, they say it will not work. I remind them that "chaos and confusion" were their watchwords—my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth remembers that—when we introduced the Funding Agency for Schools. That turned out to be one of our most successful measures. Every grant-maintained school that I visit tells me how well the funding agency is operating, even at this early stage of its development. Opposition Members are essentially conservative in their outlook. Part of me rather grudgingly admires their conservatism. As soon as we suggest a change, their immediate and instinctive response is to say that it will not work and that it will be disastrous and difficult for schools and parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a regard for that instictive reaction. We, however, believe that education is a dynamic process, that it must respond not only to the desires of parents but to the needs of the modern world. It is the Government's duty to play our part—in co-operation with local education authorities whenever possible—to maximise the opportunity of improvement in schools generally. Whenever we see institutional failure in the system, we believe that it is our responsibiltiy to make changes. That, in large part, is what the Bill is all about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Is he saying that he has such a low opinion of himself and his civil servants that he needed the Funding Agency for Schools to run the system more efficiently than he could, or is he saying that, in Wales, where we do not have the Funding Agency for Schools, the Welsh Office and its Ministers are, by implication, providing a second-class service for the few grant-maintained schools there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman is uncharacteristically unfair. In comparing the grant-maintained community in England with that in Wales, he is comparing chalk and cheese. I regret that that is so; I should like there to be more grant-maintained schools in Wales—that is the position that Conservative Members have always held. The creation of the funding agency as the necessary framework for the growing community of grant-maintained schools in England was a justifiable move, which I believe has worked extraordinarily well. My complaint relates to the Opposition Members, who were wrong in their predictions of doom and gloom when we set up the FAS only three years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that it is the Government's responsibility not only to create opportunities but to root out failure where it exists. I refer again to the 15 per cent. and the Government's failure to analyse whether the take-up level has been a success. How can one tell whether it has been a success or a failure? How does one know where one's responsibility lies? Does the Minister believe that one can abdicate responsibility for education while evincing interest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman must recall is that it was this Government who provided the framework of the national curriculum to give every child his or her entitlement within the education system; it was this Government who, in the face of hostility from Opposition Members, opened up the education system through the publication of results; and it was this Government who provided Ofsted and the failing schools provision to root out failing schools and demand an improvement. I have no problem with those.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, it was this Government who provided local management of schools and delegated budgets, thereby giving schools—and parents and governors in the local communities—the maximum flexibility within the framework of entitlement and openness that we created. There is no contradiction here. All those measures were taken deliberately to maximise the possibility of improving standards, and it was the conservatism of Opposition Members, who resisted

In our sitting last Tuesday I made a short peroration on the high esteem in which I hold you, Mr. O'Hara; I am sure that you read it, with your usual scrupulous attention to detail, in the 	<i>Hansard</i> report. It is a case of: "I refer the hon. Gentleman to the statement I made some time ago".

12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We move seamlessly on from the debate we have just had to the debate on schedule 1. I shall speak briefly and succinctly to what is a profoundly important amendment; it is propelled by logical good sense and hardly needs elaboration. The amendment provides a small check and balance against the powers we have given school governors and would ensure that when governors chose to exercise those powers and go selective, in a primary or a secondary school, the local authority would have the duty to make sure that that did not affect the range of choices available to other pupils. The authority would also consider the proposal in the light of the proper and efficient use of resources

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>107</span>
and of matters such as empty school places in the area—matters about which the Government have in the past expressed their concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would be of great importance to Conservative Members because they are more likely tohave in their constituencies small villages, perhaps with one primary school, or small county towns with one secondary school. The Bill enables the governors of such schools unilaterally to preclude some of the children in that area. I have enormous respect for school governing bodies—many contain excellent people. In some areas, including my constituency, it is sometimes difficult to fill the places on governing bodies. Because of the pressure and work involved, many people say that they would like to serve on their local governing body but do not feel they have the time or the knowledge to do so and many governors tell me that they find it very difficult to understand many of the things that happen in the governing body. I fully sympathise with those laypeople, who are trying to come to terms with increasingly complicated education legislation.

It is interesting that in this century, developments in education have generally been based on identifying a problem and solving it through legislation, together with local education authorities and the Government. Yet over the past 10 or 12 years, local education authorities have themselves been seen as the problem. The Bill seeks to reduce the powers of local education authorities, as the locally elected bodies that represent people; it undermines the authorities' responsibility to ensure that the interests of all children, not just some, are recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that selection creates choice. We have no difficulty with parents choosing. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) said, we are in favour of parents making a choice between one school and another; in urban areas, it is possible for parents to choose between good schools. However, a system of selection immediately prevents some children from having any choice and thereby undermines what happens in other local schools. The Bill provides a choice for the few but not for the many and that is why we need the check and balance provided by the amendment, which would enable a local authority to examine a proposal to go selective and to form an educated view of the effect it would have on other children and funding in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that last week, the Minister referred to the Bill as being permissive. I know that he is one of the more cerebral members of the Conservative party; I hope that saying that does not do too much damage to his political future in his new pastures. He talked about the number of schools going grant maintained. When she was Prime Minister, Lady Thatcher said that half of all schools would be grant maintained by 1992. Just after the 1992 election, the then Secretary of State for Education, the right hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Mr. Patten), said that 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000 schools would be grant maintained. In fact, slightly more than 1,000 schools are grant maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>108</span>
The Minister always has a political alibi. As I say, he is a cerebral member of the Conservative party. He says that he is somewhat relaxed about whether schools become grant maintained. He now uses the same argument about whether or not schools become selective. On several occasions, he has said that he is somewhat relaxed about the matter. The Minister and his hon. Friends are using that as a political get-out clause because they know, as do we, that there is no enthusiasm among parents for selection at secondary level—certainly, there is none for selection at primary level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This might be of historical interest to the Minister, but I wonder how many of his constituents have written to him in the past five years to demand that the primary schools in Worcestershire become selective. I wonder how many groups of parents have asked him about that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is now going to assist us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am indeed going to assist, as ever. The answer is that politics does not work that way, as the hon. Gentleman well knows. Few, if any, parents wrote to me or any of my colleagues to demand the publication of school results, but that has become one of our most enormously successful policies in recent memory. Simply because a Member of Parliament does not receive letters demanding something does not mean that it is not a good idea or that it is not immensely popular when implemented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister because we now know how many people wrote to him to demand selection in primary schools: nil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many good authorities, including that of Devon which various parties have controlled—I do not make a political point—have published information about schools for many years. They have done so unilaterally because parents wanted that information. So there was a demand for information; parents were saying that they wanted more information about schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the end, the Government responded to a genuine perception that parents needed more information, and they ensured that all authorities followed that good practice. However, how many parents demanded an extension of selection at primary level? The answer is none. I know of no parents' group or individual parent who has demanded it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, we discussed choice within the tripartite system. In fact, there was a bipartite system in most areas. That system ensured that 80 or 90 per cent. of children had no choice and were deemed to be failures. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, who is not here now, made a revealing and moving intervention. What did he tell us about his education? He did not tell us about the people or teachers whom he knew, the subjects that he took or exams that he passed 40 years ago. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I was not successful in obtaining the 11-plus."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 21 November 1996; c. 67.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>109</span>
Forty years on, the hon. Gentleman mentioned his own failure. Does not that exemplify what is wrong with such a system? Selection gives people the lifelong perception of failure. I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has overcome that impediment in the early part of his life. However, I contest his diagnosis that others, too, must fail if they wish to succeed later in life. Such a notion will not stand up to examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment exposes a stark difference between the two sides of the Committee. Conservative Members have an obsession with the few, but the amendment shows that we are interested in the education of the many. That is important. If the amendment were not accepted, just the few would be covered by the Bill. The interests of the selected few will be preserved. The many will go unregarded. We want to ensure that safeguards will be created for pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether my hon. Friend was about to touch on this matter, but will he comment on the position when increased selection can constrain choice, something of which we have already had experience. Sixteen of the 17 secondary schools in Bromley have opted out. After one school decided to increase its selection, the other schools decided to do so because they feared that they would be disadvantaged if they did not. There is now 15 per cent. selection in secondary schools throughout Bromley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the Greenwich judgment, children can come from out of the borough. One secondary school advertised in the 	<i>Evening Standard</i> for pupils to apply for the school's selection process. At the end of last year's summer term, when all their friends were about to be bought new school uniforms and visit their new secondary schools, 10 little 11-year-olds in a primary school in Mottingham, in the less advantaged part of Bromley, did not have a school to go to. Eventually, the FAS shoved them into a school, but the impact of their not having the choice was not just devastating to their psychological preparedness for secondary school, but demonstrated that increased selection was bound to limit the choice for others wanting a place in the borough in which they live.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has explained fully what happens when a substantial number of, or all, schools become selective. That is not just a problem in Bromley. There are other areas where places in local schools are not available to children. Some of them are bussed substantial distances to schools that will take them. It is bad enough for a child of 11 or 12 years to be "carred" around the town, but it is serious for a child aged five who lives in a village and who is denied a place in the local school. I am sure that the Minister will give us his response to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, I always try to do so. What conclusion does he draw about the quality of education offered in Lewisham and Greenwich? Many parents who live in that area want their children to attend the excellent Bromley schools. Have any children in Bromley been deprived of a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>110</span>
school place because of the choice of a parent from Southwark to send his or her child to St. Olave's in Bromley?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have no problem with people moving from one area to another and choosing schools. I made that clear a moment ago. The point that we are making is that one person's choice should not be another's disadvantage. The Bill's provisions will further disadvantage substantial numbers of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised at the Minister making disparaging comments about comprehensives. I recall that last week he said they were grey and monolithic. Is that how he would describe those comprehensives that are performing extremely well in his constituency, in Worcester and throughout the country? I cited the example of a comprehensive school in Solihull, where 86 per cent. of the children get five GCSEs at grades A to C. It is an excellent school. Is the Minister saying that it is monolithic, grey, dull and boring?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had the pleasure of visiting a school that the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment visited recently—the Tavistock community college in Devon. It is an excellent college and comprehensive school. I know from the staff that the Under-Secretary was extremely impressed and I saw that the local newspapers reported her praising the wonderful diversity of work in the school. That is an example of quality comprehensive education. The Under-Secretary rightly praised a superb school that has no intention of becoming grant maintained. It is supported by its local education authority and much of its success is down to that authority enabling things to happen. Its new status as a specialist school was assisted by the local education authority. The Under-Secretary has been silent until now, but I hope that we shall not hear from her mouth the general blanket condemnation of comprehensive schools as monolithic, grey and uninteresting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking about choosing between one school and another, but if we were, surely the choice is between one which is good and another which is good. It is not a matter of choosing between a selective school and one that is non-selective; unfortunately in this instance there is nowhere else to go. That is no choice for parents. The real choice is for schools such as Tavistock community college when there are no other local ones within easy reach. Tavistock college is a good 10 miles from the next school. The real choice is offered by a good comprehensive school because good comprehensives offer a wide-ranging curriculum and diverse activities. They are not grey or monolithic but offer excellent choice and have massive diversity within their walls. The Minister must take note of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in areas such as Devon do not exercise great choice in secondary education because of the distances involved. The cost of transporting people would be extreme. In the past, many of the people in the area have voted Conservative—I do not know whether they still have that in mind for the next election. People want a good school in their areas which offers choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>111</span>
I hope that the Minister will tell us what will happen to schools such as Tavistock college. It is an excellent school that is oversubscribed and has difficulty containing all the people within it. What will happen if it chooses to go 20 per cent. selective? It will probably attract those parents who can afford the transport from other areas. Their children can be brought to schools by minibus, as happens in some parts of the country. What will then happen to the local children who will be denied a place in Tavistock college? That is the key question. Who will find a place for those children? Those from lower income backgrounds, with no transport, will have problems because the nearest school is 10 miles away. Parents will have no choice whatever in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one matter that the Minister must make absolutely clear in his summing up. The schedule gives the power to governing bodies to act—without consultation, as we heard last week. The Minister does not have any idea how consultation might take place. Perhaps that is another thing that he is relaxed about; governing bodies can go ahead without talking to anyone. We say that they should at least talk to the local education authority and that the LEA should have a view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister can clarify the matter. Paragraph 2(1)(b) of schedule 1 states that a school can
	<br><blockquote><p>"alter the proportion of pupils so admitted in that age group."</p></blockquote>
Would that apply to a school that was partially selective or wholly selective, such as a grammar school? Could a governing body decide, under that provision, on less selection and could a grammar school decide to reduce the amount of selection?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us get this clear; from a sedentary position, the Minister said, "yes." I hope that he will confirm that. I am not sure whether that is what he intended. I am not sure whether Conservative Members know. I am not sure whether the hon. Members for Rugby and Kenilworth and for Sutton and Cheam realise that the schedule enables a governing body of a grammar school or a partially selective school to reduce the number of children selected, without consulting the parents or the local authority, and without recourse to anyone. Let us hear the Minister's answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was doing quite well. He is now running ahead of himself; he is mixing two points. The answer to the specific question of whether the Bill gives discretion for schools to move up or down the scale is yes, because we on the Government Benches like to give that sort of discretion. I know that heavy-handed Opposition Members hate the idea of any local discretion of any kind whatever—that is the tenor of all their comments, which I regret.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in speaking about consultation, the hon. Gentleman was talking about something quite different. We shall come to that matter later in the Bill and I shall deal with it when it arises. I shall not be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>112</span>
misled or led down that path by the hon. Gentleman. The answer to the question he asked before he became mixed up is yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that anyone has been misled. The Minister has made it absolutely clear that if the governing body of a grammar school or a partially selective school decides to reduce the number of selected pupils, it can do so without consulting anyone. In answer to my intervention last week, he said that he did not have in mind any obligatory consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for giving me the chance to raise the matter. We shall shortly be debating amendments Nos. 50 and 51, which deal with that specific point. The Minister is wrong; schools can sometimes exceed their selective levels. They may want to bring down their selective levels, but cannot do so without first consulting and getting the approval of the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We look forward to clarification of those matters when the Minister answers the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can now all see why the amendment would be a central addition to the Bill. If we are to have increased of decreased selection, and if the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam is likely to see grammar schools reduced in number, I am sure that she will want to know that the local authority will have a view on the effect on other schools. For instance, the local authority may want to inform the secondary modern schools that more able children will be going to their schools. Those other schools would need to know that and the LEA should plan for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is essential. I look forward to hearing the Minister passing comment on the business of the LEA having some say and at least protecting those parents who are not successful in the selection procedure. I should be particularly interested to hear the Minister clarify the position on grammar schools—especially for his hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is our old friend, the Opposition obsession with local education authorities, which I suppose I understand, it is distinctly unhealthy and, given the recent abysmal performance of a number of LEAs, rather bizarre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Government have, over the past several years, provided mechanisms whereby education can be diversified, not least away from the monolithic and heavy-handed control of LEAs. The hon. Member for Devonport no doubt wishes, like me, that accountability were better exercised at local level—perhaps we also share the desire for a higher turn-out in local elections—but the reality is that Conservative Members prefer accountability and discretion to be exercised as locally as possible. That is why we provided the grant-maintained option, delegated budgets, local management of schools and all the other measures to allow schools to get out from under those LEAs that have failed them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know from the publication of results and Ofsted inspections, for instance, that some LEAs have persistently failed their pupils—Islington is a good
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0161">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>113</span>
example. Against that background, I find it odd that the hon. Gentleman, who has a deep-rooted concern for children's welfare, should move such an amendment, which would not only establish but protect and ring-fence LEAs' role in such matters. That is the paradox, which I find rather difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am comfortable with the idea that we are trying to find ways in which we can sensibly move education forward and allow schools reasonable discretion to make decisions, in the light of what they see as local circumstances, free of the constraints imposed by LEAs—which are, to say the very least, variable in the quality of education that they have provided under the responsibilities that they have had certainly since 1944.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to look and sound innocuous, but it is a cleverly worded attempt to undermine the whole principle and direction of the Bill, and I hope that the Committee will reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments have a simple purpose. They require consultation to take place before a school moves to increased selection up to its percentage limit. A county school would consult its local education authority; a voluntary school would consult its voluntary sponsor in the LEA area. and a grant-maintained school would consult the LEA and any voluntary authorities with schools in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>114</span>
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not—as the Minister put it in his comments on the previous amendment—ring-fence the outdated role of local education authorities. On the contrary, we believe in partnership, and we believe that it is better to have co-operative consultation than the unbridled free market in educational provision. We do not believe that the two are congruent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's consultation requirements are wholly inadequate given the potential impact of selection of up to a maximum of 20 per cent., or 30 per cent. in the case of special schools, on the parents of pupils in the school and in the local area, on governing bodies of nearby schools, on the local education authority and on Church authorities. We contend that schools are part of the wider community and that they should be governed in the interests of the school and of that wider community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Governing bodies are charged with looking at the narrow interests of the school. There is nothing wrong with that. By definition, the governing body's function is to look after the school, but other interests must also be protected—those of parents of pupils registered at the school and of the parents of children who might reasonably expect to attend that school in future. Changing one school has a potential impact on other schools in that area, or even in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill appears to ignore the necessary requirement for local education authorities to ensure that resources are used efficiently. I know that the Minister, and most of the hon. Members on the Government side, would be the first to stand up and abuse local authorities that did not deploy resources for education as efficiently as possible, but can we afford to see education money being spent on transport because parental preference cannot be met as a result of selective places denying children places at the local school that their parents want them to attend?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's changes are not minor; they could have a major impact on education in a given area. Local education authorities have a duty to ensure that there are sufficient places for pupils within their areas. It is only just that the pupils who happen to meet the admissions criteria within an area must include all pupils, not just some. It is also right that those who have a legitimate interest in the actions of a school should know what is intended, how that might affect them and that their views will be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is necessary to amend schedule 1 to attend to the rights to consultation of all concerned before changes take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have now reached the point at which it is appropriate to discuss consultation. I shall try to deal comprehensively with that point because a number of Opposition Members have raised it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I want to make it clear that we are committed, as we always have been in legislation and guidance, to trying to ensure the fullest possible consultation with everyone who has a legitimate interest in any changes propoesed by a school, an education authority or whoever. We have a good record on consultation. Existing legislation requires those bringing forward
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0162">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>115</span>
proposals to consult such persons as appear to them to be appropriate. I refer the Committee to circular 23/94, a copy of which I took the trouble to bring with me, which sets out in some detail those who should be consulted for various different types of proposal. I mention that to set the scene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultation is already well established not only in statute but in the form of circulars, which is the way in which the Department promulgates the detail underpinning statute. That means that if those concerned do not act reasonably in deciding, for example, who to consult, they can rightly be challenged in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is that model that the Bill is intended to follow, in particular in clause 6 and in paragraph 6 of schedule 1—to which the hon. Member for Devonport referred a few moments ago—which require those proposing to make changes to consider who to consult in the light of guidance from the Secretary of State. That is a phrase on which Opposition members of the Committee have not concentrated, but which is the key to the approach that I shall describe in a moment. Paragraph 6(3) of schedule 1 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In discharging their duty under this paragraph the admission authority shall have regard to any guidance given from time to time by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
That is familar territory to old hands at education legislation, because we always resist attempts to include too much detail in the Bill, but then use circulars or guidance to flesh out such details. As the Committee will recall—I have said this often before—the reason that we do that is that as soon as something is included in the Bill it is set in concrete and is difficult to change, whereas circulars and guidance are much more flexible and can be changed according to changing circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister is talking about what is written in the Bill, paragraph 6(2) of schedule 1 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the admission authority shall…carry out any consultation (if any) as appears to them to be appropriate."</p></blockquote>
Why are the words "if any" included? Those who drafted the Bill must be assuming that there are circumstances in which no consultation will take place. Will the Minister give us an example of when no consultation will take place when a school moves towards selectivity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that point. The hon. Gentleman looks unusually pleased with himself. He obviously thinks that he has scored a bulls-eye, but all that he has done is to anticipate the fourth paragraph of my notes—I have only reached the third paragraph. I have regard for his anticipation in this case but, if he will allow me, I shall first complete the third paragraph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unusually, I have a note in my hand from which I am reading systematically in order to ensure that I get the matter more right than Opposition members of the Committee may think that I usually do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had reached the important point that arises from paragraph 6(3) of the schedule about consultation being undertaken in the light of guidance from the Secretary of State. That brings within the ambit of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
legislation not only changes that no longer require the publication of proposals but other non-statutory changes in admission arrangements. The latter changes are not at present subject to a statutory duty to consult, so in some respects the Bill will strengthen current requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in order to cater for minor changes in admission arrangements—this is the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question—we felt it right for the legislation to allow for circumstances in which, having considered the issue of consultation, governors properly decided that it was not necessary. But the Bill does not weaken the requirement to consult those who have legitimate interests, including other schools in the area, and who may be affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was slightly difficult to follow and I hope that the Minister, who has had the opportunity of reading and absorbing it, will correct me if I am wrong. As I understand it, the Bill and the schedule clearly layout those circumstances in which consultation is not required. For example, paragraph 2 of schedule 1 is full of references to situations in which consultation will not be required, later amendments expand on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet the Minister has said that he wants to retain flexibilty as to who should be consulted, where consultation is appropriate. Does he accept that in some matters, such as selection, there are legitimate interests, such as those of neighbouring secondary schools, feeder schools and the LEA—because of the impact on total numbers—which are so obvious that it would be sensible to put the obligation to consult them on the face of the Bill, just as the Minister has specified in it those areas where no consultation is necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I gave way to the hon. Lady. Not only was her intervention lengthy, but it anticipated the next part of my notes. That is the second time that has happened and I am more than ever convinced that my officials, whose wisdom in such matters is unbounded, know exactly what points members of the Committee will raise and therefore give me notes that deal with them before they are raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am not anticipating something even further down the Minister's notes. Did he say that a school that made a small change to its admission arrangements would not necessarily need to consult? If that is the case, could a school select, say, 2 per cent. one year without consultation, a further 2 per cent. the following year and so on, on an incremental basis, until it became fully selective?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this occasion, I have instant advice. The answer to the question is that such a school would get away with it, if I can put it like that, for one year, but not incrementally. We want to ensure that procedures are laid down that will try to stop incremental increases. [Hon. Members: "How?"] We shall deal with the "how" later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to probe the Minister on that. Is he saying that there are measures still to be put before the Committee or are they already included in the Bill? If so, can he enlighten us as to where the power to pre-empt such an incremental approach is set out in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not in the Bill. I am trying to enlighten hon. Members about something that is not in the Bill, but they will not let me. If Opposition Members will settle down and allow me to get on with paragraph 4 of my excellent notes, they might get the answer to some of their questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall illustrate what we have in mind by reference to proposals from grant-maintained schools to introduce selection. In such cases, we would expect the guidance to say that those whom the Secretary of State considers should be consulted include the following: any LEA likely to be affected; the Funding Agency for Schools; other county, voluntary or grant-maintained schools in the area, including feeder primary schools; parents and teachers who may be affected; the appropriate diocesan authorities where a school has a particular religious affiliation and any connected or other charitable body in the case of a non-diocesan school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidance will be likely to say that schools that already have an element of selection will still need carefully to consider whether to consult on further proposed increases in their selective proportions. However, depending on local circumstances, it may be decided that consultation on an increase of up to 5 per cent, in the same subject may not be necessary, provided the change would not take the school above a threshold of 50 per cent. If it were proposed to increase the percentage by selecting an additional subject, consultation would be required. We also intend that guidance should give advice on the procedures to be followed in carrying out the consultations; it would also probably state that the proposals should be clearly set out in writing and that interested parties should be given a reasonable period, of at least one month, in which to comment. There should be a clear statement of where comments should be sent and of the final date for their receipt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to break into the Minister's peroration, but we need some clarification. We are told that schools do not need the mass of consultation in certain circumstances but that they do in others. To take a precise example, what threshold of selectivity must a county school cross before it triggers the consultation arrangements? If the Minister does not know the answer, the clause will be wholly unworkable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>118</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard that one before. I am not so green as to fall for those sorts of questions. I am describing the guideline and consultation procedure that is envisaged under the Bill, but I do not know the answers to all those detailed questions because we have not yet consulted on them. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is not good enough for Opposition Members to try to make me say in enormous detail what the underpinning arrangements are because we have not yet reached that stage of the procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may recall an exchange that he and I had last Thursday—recorded in columns 79 and 80 of the 	<i>Official Report</i>—when I cited the example of the consultations that the Welsh Office held on possible selection arrangements in which only one head expressed any interest in selection; all the other heads in the local authority said no. When I asked whether that head could go ahead with selection in his school under the new procedures, the Minister indicated that the head could do so and that the other schools would have to learn to adapt. So it seems that the consultation procedure will be meaningless as the Minister will give his approval to any school that wants selection even though all the other schools in the area do not want it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether ministerial approval is involved depends on the extent to which schools want to change. We must be careful to avoid transmuting consultation into referendums. Opposition Members might be comfortable with the idea that there must be a formal referendum for everyone in a catchment area before any change is made. That seems to be the Opposition's policy. They would let an unspecified local electorate decide on the status of, for example, a grammar school. If that is not the policy of the hon. Member for Bath, perhaps he will enlighten us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not enlighten the Minister on that point; I should be ruled out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been considering what the Minister said about consultation on consultation and, in doing so, I have enjoyed looking at his officials, to whom he has referred on several occasions. I want the Minister to give simple answers. Is it his intention that there will be consultation on the proposed consultation arrangements to be included within the guidance notes? If so, what is the implication for the introduction of the Bill's provisions? Can we assume that they will not be introduced until that consultation has been completed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be the normal practice. However, the hon. Gentleman does not know when I would start the proceedings. If he thought, for example, that the implementation of the Bill's provisions could be delayed, I could arrange for the consultation to take place so that the time neatly dovetailed and, therefore, the problem did not arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be issuing threats which imply that he will do something if we think that the implementation of the Bill will be delayed. I am not

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>119</span>
threatening the Minister, but merely asking him to give us straightforward pieces of information. First, will there be consultation on the proposed guidance and, secondly, when will that take place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would expect there to be consultation. We consult on anything that moves these days; it is perfectly normal practice. I would expect it to be done as soon as it is required to facilitate the advancement of the Bill and to coincide with its enactment—I do not think that there is any difficulty in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Opposition Members now understand the significance of paragraph 6(3) of schedule 1. We are in well-established territory in relation to the range and extent of consultation and the fact that that consultation would be a serious and integral part of the Bill's proceedings. Given that and given my explanations, I hope that the Committee will agree that the amendment is otiose and that we can safely reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a suspicion that the Minister and his friends the officials are making this up as they go along. He talks about a curious process of consultation on consultation, with no time frame, but we are supposed to accept his word that it will be carried out concurrently with the Bill's progress. I await with eager anticipation the details of the form, if nothing else, that the consultation will take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that, despite the evidence that the Secretary of State gave the Select Committee, the Government have no intention of implementing the Bill before the general election? They know that they will not be in office after it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true to say—we have put it on record—that the first part of the Bill concerns the political agenda leading up to the general election; the debate is part of that. It would be indulgent of me to pursue the matter further on behalf of Opposition Members of the Committee, although we would like to return to it in some detail at a later stage, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 26 in page 52, leave out lines 41 to 44.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 23, in clause 4, page 4, leave out lines 24 to 29.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. The amendments are probing; they are designed to further our understanding of what is meant by the process of consultation. Lines 41 to 44 of schedule 1, as I read them, suggest that if the appropriate threshold is exceeded because of the variation in admissions policy, consultation should take place; if the threshold is not exceeded, consultation will not take place. Paragraph 2(3), therefore, seems to suggest that even if an increase in selection in a particular school takes the proportion
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>120</span>
over the threshold, there will be consultation only if another condition is met, that condition being that there is—
	<br><blockquote><p>"a significant change in the character of the school".</p></blockquote>
I tabled amendment No. 26 to establish whether paragraph 2(3) introduces another condition that must be met before consultation is triggered. If so, the result could be the recipe for chaos that we have outlined in other discussions on consultation. For example, in an area such as Bromley, where most schools are selective, people may have less choice because fewer places are available. I give an example. If a school selects 20 per cent. of its pupils and then decides to select an additional 5 per cent., would that trigger consultation because the character of the school has been changed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is an attempt to understand whether there are two conditions. The Minister has frequently talked about the importance of parental choice; he says that he wants the fullest possible consultation with all those who have a legitimate interest, and I think that he would agree with us that there should be openness and transparency in consultation. If so, will he make it clear whether there are two conditions that need to be met?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 26 and 23 would remove provisions for controlling changes in the proportion of selective admissions when, both before and after the change, the proportion would remain above the relevant threshold. The provisions confirm that, in such cases, statutory proposals would be needed if the change would amount to a significant change of character. For example, if a county school that had already selected 40 per cent. of its pupils wanted to move to 50 per cent. selection, the LEA would need to consider whether the change would produce a significant change of character. If the question arose, it would be settled by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 1 and clause 4 are intended to deal comprehensively with any change in selection admissions. The amendments would mean that they would say nothing about changes above the thresholds. The assumption would, therefore, probably have to be that such changes would be dealt with by the existing statutory proposals regime, which requires publication if the change amounts to a significant change in the character of the school. That, of course, is exactly what the proposed subsection and paragraph—which the amendments would remove—provide for, so the amendments would probably have no practical effect and, I believe, would make the Bill less clear. I ask the Committee to reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We tabled the amendments to seek clarification of the provision. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is to prevent reductions below the selection threshold, once it has been exceeded, from being subject to control by the Secretary of State. Paragraph 2(4) of schedule 1 requires the Secretary of State's approval for a significant change of character of the school if the selective proportion of the school's intake is changed to exceed or fall below the 20 per cent. or 30 per cent. threshold under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals would change the measure so that only a change to exceed the relevant threshold would require the approval of the Secretary of State. Conversely, a school that had previously selected more than the threshold and which changes its admission arrangements to reduce its selective intake would no longer require the Secretary of State's approval. On thresholds being exceeded, we accept that the purpose of the Bill is to allow schools to become more selective, but we believe that it is reasonable to set definite limits to the extent to which that can happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we cannot see any justification for mechanisms to prevent schools from becoming less selective. Let us consider the circumstances in which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>122</span>
that might happen. Any degree of selection depends on there being a greater number of potential pupils seeking places from which a lesser number can be selected. The proportion of pupils that can be selected will, therefore, depend on the school being oversubscribed. If the number of pupils—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the number of pupils seeking admission under the selective criteria falls below the appropriate percentage, the selective percentage must also fall unless the number of pupils admitted under the non-selective admissions procedure is reduced to a balancing level. If applications under the non-selective criteria are buoyant, pupils could be turned away while surplus places remain in the school. In our opinion, that would be nonsense. It would be a denial of parental choice and it might be unlawful under the present—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
