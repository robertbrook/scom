	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Atkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ribble)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook.

Is that a mistake that should be corrected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only assume that, if it is not a typographical mistake, the Committee was called at this time of day in the hope that the right hon. Member would be awake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Simon Burns)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Professions Supplementary to Medicine (Arts Therapists Board) Order of Council 1997.</p></blockquote>
The order creates an Arts Therapists Board under the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act 1960. Arts therapists are specialist practitioners who bring psychotherapeutic techniques to bear on enabling clients with severe communications problems to externalise feelings through a particular artistic medium. The broad effect of the order is to extend the 1960 Act as if the profession were included alongside those that the Act already covers: chiropodists, dieticians, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, medical laboratory scientific officers and radiographers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board's function will be to promote high standards of professional education and conduct, under the umbrella of the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine—the CPSM—whose duty it is to co-ordinate and supervise the activities of all the boards. The board's main duties are: to prepare and maintain a register; to approve training courses leading to state registration and the institutions providing them; to determine applications for admission to the register on the basis of qualifications and experience acquired either in the United Kingdom or elsewhere; and to set up investigation and disciplinary committees to produce guidance on conduct and to deal with individual cases of misconduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Practitioners who are registered by the board will be entitled to call themselves state registered arts therapists. The use of that title by a person who is not registered will be an offence, as will the use of any title or description which falsely implies that he or she is registered under the 1960 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act requires that the board should have a majority of members from the professions concerned. It
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
will have 17 members appointed by the CPSM, of whom nine will be nominated by the profession in the first instance, and thereafter elected by registrants. Of the remaining members, three will be doctors nominated by the Scottish and English royal colleges and one will be an expert in professional education; two will represent the interests of employers, one will represent the interests of patients and carers and one will be from the health or social care professions other than medicine or the professions regulated under the Act. Neither patients nor employers have hitherto had a voice on boards. The creation of this board offers a good opportunity to fill that significant gap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of members on the CPSM itself will also increase from 24 to 27 because the Act requires that all boards have a professional representative on the council, and that the number of medical and professional members should be equal. The third lay member preserves the balance of representation between professional, medical and other members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arts therapists comprise a small, highly specialised group. The UK work force number only about 1,500 practitioners. All were originally hospital based, but now increasingly work in community, general practice, education, social services and prison settings, generally in the mental health field. Only a minority—about 30 per cent.—are directly employed in the national health service, although practitioners in other sectors accept referrals of NHS patients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not mean to delay the Committee unnecessarily, but I should genuinely like to know what orthoptists, prosthetists and orthotists do. Is my hon. Friend able to tell me?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for that question. The answer is yes, I certainly will. If he will bear with me, I should like first to finish describing the purpose of the draft order as it relates to arts therapists, and will return to his question when I reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
State registration of arts therapists will give a clear and objective signal to the public—and to colleagues making referrals—of the high standards of training, conduct and practice that they can expect. The paramount interest is that of patients and carers, who will often be in no position to judge the standing of practitioners. They can be assured that both those falsely claiming such standards, and those falling short of them, will be effectively dealt with in work planning by keeping a continuous record of the pool of registered practitioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, state registration will provide a benchmark for employers, offer an opportunity to strengthen the collaboration between the health professions, provide a coherent mechanism for dealing with overseas qualified practitioners—including those from the European Union wishing to exercise the right of freedom of movement—and assist in work force planning by keeping a continuous record of the pool of qualified practitioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will provide a scheme of self-regulation at arm's length from Government. We are satisfied that arts therapy, though still a relatively young profession, has sufficiently developed to join the family of mature professions regulated by the CPSM.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did I hear the Minister correctly; did he say that there will be three representatives from the royal colleges? Have I misread the diagram, which appears to provide for only two—one from the Royal College of Physicians in London and one from the Royal College of Psychiatrists?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to clarify that point for the hon. Gentleman. Of the remaining members, three will be doctors nominated by the Scottish and English royal colleges and one will be an expert in professional education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.37 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Fisher 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to say that it is unusual to have a Committee considering a statutory instrument attended by so many distinguished former Ministers. I shall reconsider that, however, because the right hon. Member for Ribble Valley—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: South Ribble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, the right hon. Member for South Ribble (Mr. Atkins). He is continuing the great tradition of those who sit in the back row of classes. As a former teacher, I remember that those who sat in the back row were always the most mischievous and those who asked the most difficult questions. Like the right hon. Gentleman, I await the Minister's advice on both the pronunciation and the responsibilities of the three professions that he mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the draft order; it seems to be a sensible initiative that recognises the development of practices within the national health service and in health care generally. This short debate gives us an opportunity that we have probably never taken before to discuss and attend to a small but important area of health care and of the arts that has been growing for the past 20 years. I was interested in the figures that the Minister gave us; from the little background reading that I managed to do, I had not realised that there were so many practitioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt from the evidence that is beginning to be reported in both arts and medical journals that the arts can give health care a great deal of help—and, I believe, the benefits do not flow only one way; the work of artists and society generally can benefit from those activities. The few arts in health care projects that I have visited during the past 10 years undoubtedly demonstrate that they can change the whole atmosphere and morale of practitioners and patients in the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we consider a hospital such as St. Mary's hospital, Isle of Wight, which has been planned with the participation of artists and architects from the beginning. That creates a very positive atmosphere in which to try to recover health, rather than the critical one of so many Victorian and later-era hospitals. Obviously, there is much to learn, but we welcome this sensible initiative which brings such workers within the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was grateful to the Minister for briefly stating the responsibilities and remit of the council, such as keeping a register and overseeing training, admissions
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
and disciplinary procedures and other professional practices. However, I wonder whether one or two other matters come within the council's remit. Although art therapy is growing quickly, it is still a small area of health care. If it is as beneficial as everyone seems to think, the dissemination of knowledge on its potential and best practice is an important role. Will the council take on that role, at least to co-ordinate the awareness and promotion of therapists' work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister said that there were 1,500 arts therapists, he seemed a little imprecise—understandably, I think—in that he said that about 30 per cent. of them worked in such-and-such an area. There are many potential areas—prison care, schools and voluntary, public and private sectors—in which arts therapists could work usefully. Is there a need for the board to establish an up-to-date database on exactly which forms of art therapy are being developed in which areas of the health service, so that potential geographical or discipline weaknesses could be identified?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help the hon. Gentleman to know that there are 900 arts therapists, 395 drama therapists and 207 music therapists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for putting that on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this is a new area of health care, will the council have responsibility not just for commissioning research, but for ensuring that it is done? The council is looking at the work of the Gulbenkian Foundation and the health care trust, so a certain amount of research is being done. However, such voluntary organisations undertake research in response to particular needs or funding opportunities. If health care is to get the best out of this developing work, establishing an orderly and coherent research base would be a good initiative. Does research into such matters come within the remit of the Medical Research Council and, if so, is it eligible for funding from it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be a good case for saying that the role of the arts, artists, arts organisations and companies is not fully taken into account under the extension of the council. What relationship will the council have to regional arts boards, the Arts Council and its client bodies? A greater awareness and understanding of arts therapy and how it might develop is as important among general practitioners and health trusts as among artists and arts organisations. There is generally a low level of awareness of best practice in arts therapy. Everyone would benefit from greater understanding and knowledge of arts therapy. The Opposition welcome this extremely good initiative and commend the Government on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.44 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Atkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Ribble)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Government Whips are fool enough to put me on one of these Committees, the least they can do is bear with me while I make a short contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fascinated by some of the bodies represented here. I wonder whether my hon. Friend the Minister can tell me who actually set up those organisations? Who defines what they do and how they do it?

	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
I speak as a former Minister with responsibility for sport. I am puzzled by the note at the bottom of page 1, which refers to "remedial gymnasts". I am not sure what remedial gymnasts do—do they make a contribution to the arts or to sport? Presumably, bodies related to sport as well as to the arts can be included as professions supplementary to medicine. I know nothing about such organisations. How are they constituted, what do they do, what rules are set to guide their behaviour and how does the Department of Health regulate their operation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) for his kind and constructive comments. They are greatly appreciated and I know that they will be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for South Ribble (Mr. Atkins) asked earlier in the debate about orthoptists. He probably now realises that they help correct squints and other visual defects. Prosthetists are responsible for designing, fitting and evaluating artificial limbs and surgical appliances. I hope that that explains sufficiently the responsibilities and functions of both groups of practitioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central asked whether we could discover whether the provision of those services was patchy in certain establishments and generally in the country. My answer is that the database to be used to register members can be used for precisely that purpose. The hon. Gentleman asked whose responsibility it was to disseminate and co-ordinate awareness and what activities would be involved. I assure him that it will be the board's responsibility. The board will also provide guidance on professional conduct and behaviour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fisher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that answer, which seems sensible. However, because so little is known about such matters, promoting best practice and
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
widening awareness could be an expensive operation if taken seriously. Will the council have a budget and will it be responsible for ensuring the work of education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The council's education work and the training of members is done through approved courses at universities and colleges. In that way, and through field work, members will gain the qualifications necessary to take part in their chosen profession—in drama or the arts—and to undertake their other responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the promotion of the board, there is obviously a general awareness and understanding of its work, but clearly it will be up to the board to promote itself. It must ensure that those who wish to enter such a vocation are aware of the best way to approach the matter. Another of its functions is to raise and maintain standards. It must also police itself, ensuring that members behave properly and that there is a proper procedure for those who, sadly, cause problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned research, but that is not a matter for the CPSM. He also mentioned the Medical Research Council; it would be up to that organisation to decide whether to place and commission research. Employers in universities can also commission research if they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for South Ribble raised the issue of therapeutic exercise—or of, in the phrase he used, remedial gymnasts. That function is a matter for health and is now merged with that of physiotherapists; only a few remain under that title, but they will not be covered under the umbrella of the CPSM. I hope that that explains the situation to my right hon. Friend, and I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
