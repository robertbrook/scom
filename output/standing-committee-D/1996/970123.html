	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Committee has considered the Cosmetic Products (Safety) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 2925).</p></blockquote>
Welcome to the Committee, Mrs. Dunwoody. We are privileged to have you as Chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister is familiar with the background to these important regulations, but other members of the Committee might not be. Until 1995, the European Parliament sought to have regulations and laws to protect consumers who wanted to buy products that were not tested on animals. Indeed, the European Parliament went beyond that and sought to ensure that cosmetic products and toiletries would not be tested on animals. Those measures were supposed to become effective in 1995, but they have still not been enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations represent an attempt to enact part of those measures, as Ministers decided to remove from the European Parliament's proposals the complete ban on animal testing. Therefore, the regulations represent the outcome of the Government's deliberations on ensuring that information on whether products have been tested on animals is made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial purpose of the regulations is to ensure that British consumers who oppose the testing of cosmetics on animals can make an informed choice when they shop. The regulations will allow leading British companies to continue to make and sell products with labels that state how the products have been made and tested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating a serious attempt to frame a law that will protect the rights of millions of consumers and enable them to exercise their free will to choose products that have not been tested on animals. Yet British manufacturers and retailers have advised us that the way in which the Government have drafted the regulations creates a major loophole which could completely undermine their ability to give consumers the information that they want about the goods that they buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support 95 per cent. of the regulations. I do not want to press the motion to a Division and perhaps have Labour's position misconstrued. My purpose this morning is to articulate the concerns of millions of consumers, animal welfare organisations and British manufacturers and retailers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
We welcome all practical attempts to strengthen laws that end animal cruelty. I hope that the Minister can convince the Committee that the regulations are such practical measures. There are two sides to the argument: on one is Robert Vanhove, secretaire general of the European Toiletry and Perfumery Association, and on the other there are world-beating companies, such as The Body Shop and Yardley, and leading retailers, such as the Co-op, Boots, Tesco and J. Sainsbury. We are entitled to ask why the Government appear to side with the European association and ignore the powerful case that British companies have advanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British public undoubtedly feel strongly about inflicting suffering on animals simply to improve the performance of shampoos, lipsticks and other cosmetic products. The Co-op's survey of 1,000 people, undertaken by National Opinion Polls, showed the strength of public feeling. There is an overwhelming desire to ban animal testing for toiletries and cosmetics once and for all. Four out of five consumers favoured banning such tests; only 7 per cent. endorsed continued testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Co-op survey contains two other important findings. The public know that cosmetic and toiletry ingredients are likely to have been tested on animals in the past, but they are stunned to discover that such tests continue. Most shoppers—three out of five—get information about animal testing from product labels and two out of three shoppers say that they would consider boycotting products that have been tested on animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first thing that we want from the proposed legislation is a clear instruction to ensure that the label on cosmetic and toiletry products lets consumers know whether a product has been tested on animals. The information must be written on the label. The Government are not making that a requirement, however. Our job today is to ensure that consumers can make an informed choice. The major continental cosmetic manufacturers have conspired to frustrate that choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Parliament sought a comprehensive ban long ago, which was in line with British public opinion. The Council of Ministers has now set a deadline for 1998, but I believe that it has let European manufacturers off the hook by saying that they can continue to test on animals until alternative tests have been developed. It has been left to manufacturers to develop those alternative tests because no time scale has been set, so 1998 will come and go. The overwhelming opposition to animal testing will be ignored. As the Co-op's survey of public opinion found, when consumers were told about the loophole allowing tests to continue, nine out of 10 people wanted the animal testing ban to be enforced by the target date of 1998. That will not happen, but that is a debate for another time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Animal testing labelling is the focus of concern today. In July 1996, the Government proposed draft legislation to put the directive into effect. The Department of Trade and Industry sought the views of industry, consumers, animal welfare experts, such as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection. They all warned that the wording of that legislation would harm—perhaps fatally—the pioneering work done on behalf of British consumers by British companies. The wording on which the Minister is insisting is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a relevant reference to animal testing is made, suppliers are under an obligation to disclose any tests which they have established have taken place, and not just tests which were carried out by them or at their behest."</p></blockquote>
A cogent case was put by retailers such as The Body Shop for enacting the directive, but a key adjustment was urged on the Minister to ensure that the directive would give consumers the information that they want and need to choose products that have not been tested on animals. I shall let the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection spell out the problem, rather than the manufacturers and retailers, who are in complete agreement with BUAV. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would be virtually impossible for these companies to say that none of their ingredients had been tested on animals—as almost all ingredients have been tested at some time in the past."</p></blockquote>
I mentioned that the draft regulations fail to require companies to divulge if the product has been tested on animals. However, they hamstring the ability of British and other companies to promote their products that have not been tested on animals. Some leading British companies have a clear policy. They do not and never have tested their ingredients or products on animals. They refuse to buy supplies from any other company if they are, or recently have been tested on animals. Because animal tests were the norm for decades, many of today's products contain items that were tested on animals at some stage—often long ago. The Body Shop leads the field in that policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider a practical example. Coal tar is an ingredient in soaps and shampoos. It was last tested on animals in 1921. Under the draft regulations, a label stating, "We do not test any of our products on animals or allow our suppliers to do so either" would be illegal, even if only an element of the product was tested all those decades ago. The proposed legislation does not put an onus on companies that continue to test on animals to put that on the label. There could be two products side by side on a shelf, one of which has been tested on animals and the other which has not. Under the draft regulations, a claim that the product is cruelty free—not tested on animals—would have to disclose that one of its ingredients had been tested 76 years ago, but the other product, which had been actively tested on rabbits, need not mention one word about that. Surely that cannot be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a list of other ingredients that have been tested on animals. Dimethicone is a silicone lubricant used in the cosmetics industry; as far as we know, it was last tested in 1953. Under the regulations, even modern cosmetics, which are light years in advance of those in the 1950	<div class='sub'>s</div> <!-- sub -->, would not be able to carry the claim "We do not test on animals" if they contain a trace of that substance. Other examples include ozokerite wax, which is widely used as a base wax in lipsticks; I am told that it was last tested in 1962. Beeswax is commonly used in creams, lotions and balms; it was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
last tested in 1970. Sodium laureth sulphate is a common base for shampoos; it was last tested in 1971. Lanolin was last tested in 1974. Water is used in almost every process as a dilutant, but if it has been tested on the skins of animals it would have to be declared as such on the label if a company makes any claim whatever about animal testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No wonder, then, that foreign competitors of United Kingdom companies are rubbing their hands with glee. Many of them sponsored the sixth amendment to the cosmetics directive to make it virtually impossible for companies to promote their ethical stand on testing on their products. That seems to have been swallowed hook, line and sinker by the Government and is reflected in regulation 4(4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I find astonishing is that the only beneficiaries of the Government's dogmatic insistence on not listening to The Body Shop or other United Kingdom businesses are foreign cosmetic and perfume manufacturers. French perfume manufacturers and the German cosmetics business can now send products here without a mention of cruel animal tests on the products that are offered for sale, whereas British manufacturers such as The Body Shop and Yardley, and retailers such as the Co-op, Boots, Tesco and Sainsbury, will be hamstrung—they will be unable to claim that their products are not tested on animals as, back in 1921, a trace ingredient was tested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is worse is that, as The Body Shop has told the Minister, the directive could easily open the way to industrial sabotage. The Body Shop does not carry out tests on animals. It produces a face cream that contains bananas as one of its ingredients. If a French rival company takes that Body Shop product and commissions unnecessary animal testing, The Body Shop would have to remove any claim on the label that the product was not animal tested or else face the humiliation of putting a warning on the product that it had been tested on animals. That cannot be right, but it is the effect of the regulations as drafted. The French are not rushing to implement them; they do not intend to do anything until further discussions on the directive are completed at some unspecified time in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the Roddicks have given the moral lead on animal testing, that The Body Shop has become an international brand name, that its 3,000 workers and its millions of consumers can say with pride, "We make and use cruelty-free products", that its export contribution to the United Kingdom economy is enormous and that it allows Britain to speak with authority against animal testing, is it not an irony that the only people who do not listen to its pleas and warnings are the very Government-the British Government—who benefit most from its contribution to the economy? The Minsiter must convince the Committee of why he and his civil servants are right and The Body Shop, Boots and Tesco are wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has been lobbied by the European Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association, which represents continential companies that are frustrating the will of millions of British consumers who do not like their products because they are actively tested on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
animals. Those companies look enviously at our great export record. British companies export about £1.2 billion worth of cosmetics and toiletries every year. We import less than £750 million worth of them. Within the European Community we are net exporters—in 1995, nearly £700 million worth was sold to Europe, whereas £550 million worth was imported, even taking into account the highly lucrative and protective French perfume market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The representatives of the French industry are saying that no company can truthfully state that products or their ingredients have never been tested on animals. Under the regulations of label that states, "We do not test any of our products on animals or allow our suppliers to do so", would be illegal, even if some element of the product was tested all those decades ago. The regulations do not place on companies that continue testing on animals the onus to make that claim on labels. It is therefore important that the Minister listen to the concerns of the industry whose firms support cruelty-free products and answer the grave charges made against him by British companies and retailers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Mr. John M. Taylor)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be proper for me to address the main issue at once, bearing in mind the support of some of my hon. Friends in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are endeavouring to create a synthesis, which we are obliged to do. We are signatories to the treaty of Rome, from which obligations flow—although this is not the time to be discussing those obligations. It is a morning on which to remind ourselves that the United Kingdom has a record on animal welfare that is second to none. We have led the initiatives in Europe for the protection of animals and for the minimisation and ultimately the elimination of the testing of products on animals; meanwhile we have kept alongside the ultimate need for human safety. I shall return to that in a while.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In commenting on the directive, I have very much in mind companies such as The Body Shop. If such companies wish through their annual statements to make their position on animal testing clear, they may do so: if through their public documents and in their shops they wish to state that they are against it and want it done away with, they are at liberty to do that. They will strike a chord with many purchasers among the British public on account of their position. They will gain commercially from that reputation, and why not? Britain is the fifth largest manufacturer in the world and the third largest in Europe. There are markets to be penetrated, not least in Europe, which is the most important cosmetics market in the world. Harmonisation is often criticised, but if we can achieve it our penetration of the French and Italian markets will be much greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those aspects come together this morning in a discussion that is about human safety and about allowing people to make clear their position on animal
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
testing. It is also about firms wishing to say something about animal testing on the labels on their products. If they do, they must tell the whole truth, not merely state "We are against animal testing." They must state "We are against animal testing. This product has not been tested on animals. Furthermore, none of the upstream ingredients have been tested on animals." That is a critical turning point. I and other members of the Committee know that this is a rubbing point between The Body Shop and these proposals—the company may be prepared to state that it has not tested itself, nor commissioned testing—but this is also an upstream argument about ingredients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Michael Clark 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rochford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I listened to the comments of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths), it occurred to me that the fact that a product was last tested on animals in 1926 or 1937 is hardly a reason for not allowing a manufacturer to say, "Our products are not tested on animals."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a test had been made say, a year ago, that would be another matter. But if it was 50 years ago, would we be right to prevent a firm from labelling a product "Not tested on animals" when the event had long since passed into history.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may return to the matter, but the general principle is that, if the purchasing public are anxious to know whether a product has been tested on animals, they are entitled to the whole truth. If the truth is that ingredient No. 7, out of perhaps 25, was tested on animals—but a long time ago—that knowledge will allow people to make whatever discount they wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the Minister's response to the charge that industrial sabotage is more likely—in fact, it is almost permitted under the provisions—when a product of The Body Shop can be tested by a rival? As a result, the organisation might be compelled to put on the label that the product was tested on animals, even though it did not sanction such testing and the ingredients were never previously tested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether such a situation will arise. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will permit me to reflect on the matter. May I also thank him for his courtesy in giving me prior notice of some other matters that he would like me to deal with?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a slightly lighter note, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South said earlier that the Government has 95 per cent. support from the Opposition for the proposals. I am reminded of Mayor Ed Koch, who was successfully elected three times mayor of the city of New York, something which I had thought to be impossible. When addressing a public audience, he said, "If you agree with me on seven points out of 10, vote for me. If you agree with me on 10 points out of 10, go and see a psychiatrist." On that basis, I consider that, being possessed of 95 per cent. support from Labour Members, I am halfway between securing the morning and seeing a psychoanalyst.

My hon. Friends have always been friendly towards me, notwithstanding all my frailties, so I hope that they will be kind enough to allow me to read into the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
record of our proceedings some significant remarks. The subject we are discussing is important; it has a European dimension, a consumer safety dimension and an animal welfare dimension. In the face of those three elements, I stand in a position of relative humility and I want a proper argument put into the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom has a long history of introducing measures to safeguard the health of the consumer. The proposition that cosmetics should be safe will, I hope, provoke no disagreement. Cosmetics are applied to the skin and mucous membranes throughout a lifetime. They are applied several times per day, every day. The existence of regulations in this area are of paramount importance to protect human health and safety. Far from being innocuous, cosmetic products have in the past contained some ingredients that are poisonous and others that are linked with cancer and birth defects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations implement the EC cosmetics directive 76/768 and all subsequent amendments to that directive. They consolidate the previous United Kingdom regulations and also implement for the first time the sixth Council amendment agreed during the UK presidency in 1992 and adopted in 1993.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say which other member states have used the exact wording of the regulations that we are discussing when implementing the directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be able to respond to that point shortly, but I am bound to say, particularly to those of my hon. Friends who are hostile to the goldplating of European directives, that the regulations are, as near as can be, a copy-out of what is proposed for all member states. I naturally wish all member states to abide by the same general ground rules, which will help British exporters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to develop the argument that the application of cosmetics by people to themselves is rather more important than simply wanting to be beautiful, to smell nice and to be a nice colour. It goes further than that; of the three important factors that I mentioned earlier, human safety is not to be diminished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the words that I shall use now should be put on record, Mrs. Dunwoody, although I do not normally use such language at home. I am bound to say that a cosmetic product is defined in the regulations as a product applied to the epidermis, the hair, the nails, the lips, the external genital organs, the teeth or the mucous membranes of the oral cavity to clean, to perfume, to change the appearance, to protect, to keep in good condition, and to correct body odours. The definition includes anti-caries toothpaste, anti-dandruff shampoo, and sunscreens to protect against sunburn—all products that are important to human health. Wow! I am glad to have finished that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations proscribe ingredients that must not be used in cosmetics. For example, until it was prohibited by regulation, mercury was used in mascara and also as a skin whitener in soaps. At present, 767 substances are banned from being used in cosmetics, including the poisonous elements of arsenic, lead and cadmium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
The regulations also list ingredients that are permitted subject to appropriate restrictions and warning labels. In the case of the more hazardous classes of ingredients, the directive prescribes approved or positive lists of the only preservatives, colouring agents and ultraviolet filters that can be used in cosmetics. Limits are placed on the use of other ingredients that are considered safe only in certain proscribed amounts and concentrations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that although the regulations are consolidating regulations, they introduce a number of new provisions contained in recent directives. One is the requirement for safety dossiers. Suppliers will now have to hold sufficient information in safety dossiers to demonstrate the safety of their products and will have to make that information available on request to the competent national authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Full ingredient listing is another new substantive provision, which forms part of regulation 6. Before placing a cosmetic product on the market in the European Union, suppliers are now required to label the ingredients used in cosmetics. To facilitate full ingredient labelling, the industry has compiled a common labelling nomenclature, which covers more than 6,000 ingredients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main benefit of full ingredient labelling is that it will help consumers to make a more informed choice when purchasing cosmetics, especially if they know that they are allergic to a particular ingredient. I say that with personal feeling because almost every aftershave product on the market brings me out in a rash. I am therefore sympathetic to people wanting to know the ingredients of the cosmetics products that they seek to purchase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would appreciate the Minister's comments about his gentle skin even more if he would address the Chair. All his wise words could then be properly recorded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, if I have directed my comments other than to the Chair. I will put that right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a question on the Minister's point about his personal reaction to a particular type of product. I, too, have such a reaction, but I would have to do much research on myself, as well as having a list of ingredients, to determine the specific ingredient to which I react. Has the Minister carried out such research, and does he think that many people will do it if they have a full list of every substance within a product?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the Minister will want to reply to some parts of that intervention. However, it would be helpful to avoid a chemistry lesson.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a chemist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely why I made that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I used to be a chemist before I came here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was a chemist or a pharmacist, but I know that I am very lazy. As soon as I found that using aftershave was uncomfortable, I did not take the trouble to read the ingredients, I simply stopped using it. That seemed to be the simplest way to the right result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations make provision for the way in which suppliers claim whether their product or its ingredients or both the product and its ingredients have been tested on animals. The transposition of that provision has given rise to much debate among United Kingdom manaufacturers and retailers about its scope and application. I understand the desire of many in the industry to satisfy their customers about the steps that they take to distance themselves from animal testing. Equally, we must ensure that customers are not misled as to whether the product that they purchase, or its ingredients, has been tested on animals. I believe that the formulation that we have adopted strikes the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a manufacturer wants to make a claim about animal testing on a product label, the consumer is entitled to the whole truth. If manufacturers want to make their position politically clear in public documents and advertising campaigns, and give their broad view on animal testing, they are fully entitled to do so. An informed consumer can have his or her own choice about that. I return to the key point: if a product label is forthcoming on animal testing, it must tell the whole truth. That is the proper and fair position, but I accept that it involves a tough decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.04 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke on Trent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The points that I want to make fall into two categories. First, I want to press the Minister a little further on the scope and application of animal testing and on the information that the regulation requires manufacturers to give to consumers. Secondly, I want to deal with the obfuscation and delay in seeking alternative testing methods, as requested under the European directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first category, the Minister's position—which my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South has amply argued against—involves significant dangers. For example, on at least three, possibly four occasions, the Minister talked about the principle of the consumer having the whole truth. I am not sure what is the whole truth—the Minister failed to explain that. I am not sure whether the consumer would want the fact a product was last tested in 1921 to prevent a company that has not tested and does not test its products on animals from promoting that product. I am not sure what consumers would think about that. I suspect that some might say, "We need to know", even though a product—coal tar—that was last tested in 1921 has caused no problem whatsoever during the past 70-odd years. I am perfectly prepared to accept that some may say, "We wish to know", but I suspect that the vast majority of consumers—the public—would say, "That is absolute nonsense."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
The Government are insisting on the whole truth—although I wonder whether the regulation will not face legal challenge concerning what is considered to be the whole truth. I also wonder whether, now that the Minister has clearly announced that principle—as he described it—the Government will apply it to all other product information. If so, by goodness, the Government will have their hands full in their dying days reinterpreting every regulation governing consumer information that has been issued by the European Union and incorporated into United Kingdom law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very much in favour of the maximum possible information being given to consumers—there is no difference between us on that. But when the Minister says that consumers require the whole truth, we have entered a debate that will keep us busy for the rest of our natural lives. I challenge the Minister to say what he means by the whole truth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact of the matter is that cosmetic product manufacturers and retailers—retailers in particular—do not have to make statements about animal testing on their products. What I am saying is that if they introduce animal testing as an issue in their description, they should tell the whole truth. They do not have to make it an issue, but if they do, they must tell all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, there is not a lot of difference between us. The Minister knows that I consider him to be one of the most courteous Ministers the Government have produced—I am happy to put that on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Praise indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, praise indeed. I am sure that the Minister will include my comment in his election address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is one thing to say that it is up to manufacturers; it is entirely another to say that the Government are going to force the principle of the whole truth. I take issue with the Minister on that—what is the whole truth? The hon. Member for Rochford made a pertinent and relevant intervention. What would be the public perception of the proposal without a dilution of the principle of consumer safety? Is it reasonable to say that an admission that a product last tested on animals more than 70 years ago—or more than 20 years ago—which had produced no problems in the interim should be part of the whole truth?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the principle of consumer information to which we all subscribe must, as the Government state, be based on stating the whole truth, no doubt we, through my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South, will challenge the Government on every regulation emanating from the European Union and implented here. I do not claim any expertise in this area and would welcome the views of members of the Committee, but this is a concept of which I had not heard before. I have not seen it in EU directives, regulations or Acts or Parliament, nor have I heard it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
mentioned by a Minister or a member of any other party until now. It is an extremely important point on which we challenge the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second aspect of the principle of whole truth enunciated by the Minister is the effect on large companies that are in the forefront of the battle to ensure that eventually animal testing for cosmetics research is banned. Companies that have taken this view—for which I commend them—will see the proposal as an obstacle to further progress if they have to adopt the line reflected in the regulations and clarified by the Minister. It will also be a bolthole into which those who do not wish to make progress will run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister proudly described the Government's record on animal testing, and I accept that it is far better than that of most members of the EU. However, their objective will be seriously compromised by the terms and interpretation of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to reflect, not because it is a party political issue or because I, as a Labour Member, am criticising a Conservative Member in the party political knockabout, but for sound practical reasons related to the interpretation of the regulations and their effect on our shared objective and that of the directive—the ultimate banning of animal testing for cosmetic research—testing for which I, for one, see no justification. I have no hesitation in putting that on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Does someone want to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Michael Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for intervening; I was merely pointing out to the hon. Gentleman that his next point was his third.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. It was my fault; I accept that, but my first two were sub-points of the first point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very nice to have such an orderly Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the help of the hon. Member for Rochford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make two sub-points on the issue of developing alternative methods. First, such methods are quite well developed. There is sufficient scientific information to justify an extension of the ban to at least five other tests including those for skin penetration, mutogenicity and skin irritancy. Can the Minister enlighten the Committee about the Government's attitude to alternative testing? I accept that the alternatives are not comprehensive, but sufficient progress has been made for the Government to press the matter vigorously so as to validate them and incorporate them in regulations as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Dicks 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hayes and Harlington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the point that if alternative methods are not available, there can be no cosmetics—that there can be no justification for ever using animals for cosmetic testing? And if there is no alternative, who cares?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put on record earlier my personal opinion on the matter. I am now attempting to reflect on the practicalities. In other words, I feel that we are entitled, on this subject at least, to say to the Government, as a leading member of the Commission and the Council of Ministers, "We believe, having considered the evidence, that some alternative methods are now available. They should be validated and those tests on animals banned."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it has to be said that the Commission's record on activity—or non-activity—in this respect has been appalling. It has tried to walk away from its clear responsibility. The RSPCA brief states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Commission had to oversee the development and validation of alternative tests to animals, so positioning it as the coordinating body."</p></blockquote>
The Commission's attitude since the passing of the European Community directive has been abysmal. The Government should press the Commission on this issue because, unless it is prepared to take more of a coordinating role—with the agreement of member states—to initiate research and to insist that the industry adopt a more positive approach, I suspect that in five or 10 years' time some Committee or other will sit in this venerable institution debating why there has not been sufficient progress to enable cosmetic testing on animals to be banned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.19 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Michael Marshall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Arundel)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One pleasure of being a Member of this place who is soon to retire is that one has the opportunity of paying tribute to people such as you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am delighted to see you in the Chair, and I shall long recall your iron fist as you helped us along our way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today the Committee can usefully do a job of work in examining ways in which the regulations can be improved so as to take forward the process of opposition to animal testing. To that extent, I find myself in agreement with the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South; I too give 95 per cent. support to the regulations. The broad principle is right but, as in so much of our delegated legislation involving the European Union, the devil is in the detail. The hon. Gentleman made a number of references to The Body Shop, whose headquarters are in my constituency; I shall come to some of its concerns later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I want to put on record the view of the British Union for the abolition of Vivisection, whose submission to the Committee gives pause for thought. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under the proposed interpretation, cruelty-free companies would be discouraged from making non-animal testing claims, and would be no better off, from a commercial point of view, than companies which did carry out animal tests. The incentive to develop non-animal alternatives would be greatly reduced, which is the precise opposite of the general aim of the legislation. Finally, no other EU country has yet implemented the relevant part of the Directive".</p></blockquote>
BUAV adds that there is no precedent for what it regards as the Department of Trade and Industry's hostile interpretation. That is a serious matter, some aspects of which have been mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
I turn to The Body Shop's view on the directive. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Minister, to whom I gave notice of my concerns in a letter; he was good enough to reply on the same day, which in my 23 years' experience has been a rare occurrence. I put on record some of what he said in what I know was a genuine attempt to meet my concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has rightly been said, one is entitled to give The Body Shop—in the person of Anita Roddick, who is so well known as to be a world figure—particular recognition for its crusade against animal testing in cosmetics. The United Kingdom has the largest non-animal testing cosmetic industry in Europe, and The Body Shop is the largest British-based retailer of cosmetic and toiletry products, so it is fitting that it should be seen to have a leading role in the campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Body Shop's labelling is designed to a common, worldwide format and currently includes the use of the statement that its policy against animal testing is endorsed by leading animal welfare groups such as the Humane Society of the United States, the International Fund for Animal Welfare and the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, which I mentioned earlier. The Body Shop told me:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have never tested our products or their ingredients on animals. We will not use any ingredient tested on animals by suppliers for cosmetic purposes after 31st December 1990."</p></blockquote>
That is an important date, as it reflects the practicality of what can reasonably be assured to the public—it represents the period during which effective monitoring has been feasible. As is well known, The Body Shop is a major British success story; it has 1,500 shops in 46 countries and more than half those shops are in the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, one is entitled to give The Body Shop's concerns the greatest attention. It is particularly concerned about the delay that is expected in the implementation of the legislation. It believes that the animal testing ban should be implemented with effect from 1 January 1998, as that is the only effective way to force the cosmetics industry to provide the resources and effort necessary to verify alternative tests. Although The Body Shop remains content that current United Kingdom legislation contains the ban, it is concerned that the subsequent delay, which may be agreed to by Her Majesty's Government, could create difficulties in driving the process forward. It urges the Committee to give unequivocal support to the ban and to press the Government to argue for carrying it forward within the European Union. It would also like the ban to be retained whatever future decisions are taken by the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his letter to me, the Minister said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Sixth Amendment also provides for the Commission to make proposals to postpone the ban in circumstances where there are not validated alternatives to animal tests. The Commission has now indeed proposed such a postponement, which is still under discussion. Should the Directive be amended, then I would also expect our Regulations to be amended. It would clearly be wrong to expose UK consumers to products, the safety of which had not been established by validated tests. However, in discussion of the Commission's proposal we have called for a total ban on finished
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
product testing, reaffirmed our commitment to the cessation of animal testing and expressed our full support for early development, validation and use of alternatives."</p></blockquote>
I welcome those assurances, but what is the likely duration of that postponement? Can my hon. Friend advise us on the state of the discussion and on how far such postponement is measurable in terms of its effect on this country and the commercial and moral arguments that are being put forward? When my hon. Friend refers to looking forward to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"early development, validation and use of alternatives",</p></blockquote>
will he tell us what he foresees as a reasonable time scale?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the much more difficult question of labelling. From what my hon. Friend the Minister said, I understand that The Body Shop can issue promotional material, show it at the point of sale and use national advertising. He seems to be using the old argument about Ministers giving every assistance short of actual help. The labelling that is currently used worldwide, which is part of the image of The Body Shop and its fight against animal testing, will be watered down. Effectively, it will have to remove its current labels. The proposals calling for different labelling are neither practical nor realistic. The Body Shop cannot say for certain, when a whole list of ingredients is involved, whether such ingredients were subject to animal testing back in the 1920s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Body Shop is concerned about the watering down of its labels. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is our view that the proposals on labelling will deny consumers choice in the products they buy, unfairly restrict our right to campaign against animal testing and damage British business both at home and throughout the EU."</p></blockquote>
Comparisons have been made with other European cosmetic companies, the United States and beyond. The Body Shop continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We therefore believe that any labelling restriction should relate to product claims such as Not tested on Animals' but not to statements of corporate intent such as 'Against Animal Testing'. We would welcome a government commitment to retaining the right of companies to express their views on this issue on product labels and in other promotional material."</p></blockquote>
In responding to that argument, my hon. Friend the Minister, in his letter, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As regards the position on animal testing claims made by manufacturers and retailers, we have tried to strike an appropriate balance between two important principles."</p></blockquote>
He has outlined that argument again today. It is important to put the contents of his letter on the record because I understand the genuine difficulty with which he and his officials have been wrestling. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The first is that manufacturers and retailers who take steps to distance themselves from the practices of animal testing should be able to draw attention to that fact. The second is that customers should not be misled as to whether the product they are purchasing, or its ingredients, has been tested on animals. I believe that the Regulations achieve this. Manufacturers and retailers remain free".</p></blockquote>
He then went on to refer to promotional material and so on. I do not believe that his assurances meet the concerns of companies such as The Body Shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context, and given the sort of practical problems that clearly remain, will my hon. Friend the Minister seek to find opportunities to carry the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
discussion further forward? If there is to be a delay—in effect, a postponement—a window of opportunity will have been created. I therefore urge my hon. Friend to give careful and sympathetic consideration to the matter. In particular, I ask him to say whether, in discussion with industry and with our European partners, we can establish if we have a majority; I suspect that we have, because the claim of foot dragging reflects on only a relatively small number of countries in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I refer to the 7th report of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, which has been tabled for our consideration today. It draws the Committee's attention to the regulations on the grounds that they make unusual and unexpected uses of the powers conferred and that they are defectively drafted in two places. It goes on to say that the Department has confirmed the defective drafting. It is therefore right that we should hear the Minister's opinion of the views put forward by the Joint Committee. If technical problems still exist, surely that is another argument for using what I called a window of opportunity to reconsider many aspsects of those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can give some assurance on that matter. We fully recognise what he is trying to achieve; in that, he has our support. I hope that he will support me in trying to reassure my constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.32 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief; I certainly shall not try to give the Committee a chemistry lesson. I am far less capable of doing that now than when I was first elected to the House. If anyone can give the House a chemistry lesson, it must be the chairman of the all-party group on the chemical industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask a series of questions, to discover why the EU has issued a directive. There is no reason to doubt the RSPCA when it says that it wants to stop the marketing of cosmetics containing ingredients tested on animals. It is obvious from what has been said that the Committee regards that as a worthy objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister then devoted some time to the question whether cosmetics should be made safe. We all believe that they should. Other elements could be added to the list given by the Minister of mercury, cadmium, arsenic and lead. Other elements may similarly be unacceptable in cosmetics, but people already know that and will not need labels to tell them that cosmetics do not contain those other elements. Certainly, no further testing would be needed to discover that such ingredients could be fatal. I am sure that we could add to that list of elements, but labelling would then be so complex that people would not read the labels and would not understand them if they did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's comments were helpful. He said that his skin was affected by most brands of aftershave, and that it was best not to use it—especially as he did not want to have to read the labels on all brands to decide to which substance he might be allergic. I suspect that he takes more care than most. Nevertheless, he takes the commonsense view that if the product affects him
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
in that way it is best not to use it. One or two people might examine carefully the effects of various samples of different companies' products to discover, from labels with long lists of ingredients, which substances affected them. However, they would be in the minority; in practice, the majority of people do not read labels carefully. Giving them the whole truth would be misleading. Less will be gained from doing so than will be gained by issuing a statement such as that issued by The Body Shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Few people, including myself who have been trained in chemistry, would understand the chemical composition of the substances. It would be counterproductive to give information in the sort of detail which the Minister described. Such labelling might be described as being nearer to the whole truth but, in terms of practicability and advice to consumers, it would be misleading. People may not wish to use certain products that could not possibly harm them because they were offput by the length of some of the chemical names on the label.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the change be helpful to those companies that take seriously testing on animals? The hon. Member for Arundel (Sir M. Marshall), who has the headquarters of The Body Shop in his constituency, outlined clearly that it would be unhelpful to such companies and make them less competitive. We know from letters that we receive from our constituents that the animal lobby is strong; I receive more letters on animal issues from constituents of various political persuasions than on any other issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people who buy cosmetic products take into account whether the products have been tested on animals, and it is important that they are well aware that companies also take a strong view about it. I suspect that the reason why The Body Shop has such a large share of the market is that it takes a strong line on animal testing and people are aware of that view. People know that they can buy products from The Body Shop without having to read their labelling, because they know the company's policy. The regulations under discussion would make the situation more difficult. Given that those shops that take the same line as The Body Shop are part of British industry, it would not be in our commercial interests to adopt a line that would be helpful to competitors abroad and unhelpful to British companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection has suggested that the correct meaning of the directive would be reflected if, in regulation 4(4), the words "by or on behalf of the manufacturer or with his express or implied
	<br><blockquote><p>consent for the purposes of cosmetics manufacture" were added after the words "carried out".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will consider that wording. I accept that it is necessary for the regulations to be drafted clearly. That is a mouthful, but if it were presented on each label on the back of all cosmetics that were sold, it would soon be taken for granted by the majority of people and would not be read. Nevertheless it is important, in furtherance of the original purpose of the objective and for practical reasons, that a slight change is made. I hope that the Minister can respond positively to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Michael Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, will attempt to be brief, as we want to hear some answers from my hon. Friend the Minister. As the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) said, this is not a political issue; it is not even a European Union issue. It is principally an issue of human safety, animal welfare and commercial enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that we want the whole truth. Yes, we want the whole truth, and people who buy cosmetics, which are basically chemicals, want to know the whole truth about the safety of what they are buying. They would be disappointed if they thought that those chemicals had not been tested and that a cosmetic could injure them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Minister said, cosmetics are not just for changing the colour of our skin, smelling nicer or improving our appearance; they are chemicals, which can directly affect the skin or—by migrating through the skin—the blood, the gut or other internal organs. Therefore, although we should think of animal welfare, we must also think of human safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If chemicals come into contact with humans, whether through being eaten, applied to the skin or taken as medicines, they should be tested rigorously to ensure that they come into the category designated for human contact. I am almost certain that, at some time, all such chemicals have been tested on animals. I have no complaint about that. In fact, if they had not been tested on animals, there would have been a dereliction of duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once a chemical has been cleared as fit for human consumption or contact, it does not change its molecular nature because 50 years have passed—it is the same chemical and, if it is made to the same degree of purity, the testing that took place in 1926, or 1876, will still be valid in 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfortunate that those companies that try to move forward into the 21st century in their attitude to animal testing might be disadvantaged. It would be unfortunate if those companies that try to be progressive were brought down to the same level as those that do not try to be progressive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South talked about a bolthole. I think that he and I are thinking about the same thing. If the regulations force companies, such as The Body Shop, to lose the advantage that they have gained through their conscience and concern, they will be pushed down and other companies, which do not deserve it, will be allowed to rise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dicks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it difficult to go along with the point that my hon. Friend is making. If The Body Shop makes great play of the fact that it does not test products on animals—I am glad that it does not—why should it not be made to state that it uses products that were once tested on animals? Surely it cannot emphasise one thing and hope that the other goes away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that point. I shall try to conclude in time to give the Minister a chance to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
In the few minutes that I have had, I hope that I have developed my argument sufficiently to say that safety to humans is paramount; animal welfare is secondary, although its importance is growing in everyone's mind. I want no one to think that, because I say that animal welfare is secondary to human safety, I am decrying animal welfare. Priorities must be set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I agree that labels might become too large, presumably there is nothing wrong with allowing The Body Shop and other responsible producers of cosmetics to state on labels that products have been appropriately tested, or that they have been manufactured to British standard specifications—which implies that there may have been testing on animals in the past. However, companies that have responsible care policies with regard to animals must be allowed to include something on the label to give them commercial advantage. So the third item on the label could be on the lines of, "No chemicals in this product have been tested on animals since 1926." However, that is not especially attractive. Or the label could say, "No products in this cosmetic have been tested on animals during the past 50 years." That is a rounder figure, and would give a stronger message.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are to have the whole truth; and the whole truth is that companies that have responsible care policies, such as The Body Shop, do not use animals for product testing. That is the whole truth. Why cannot we have on labels, as part of the whole truth, the words, "We do not use animals for product testing"? That does not say that no products have ever been tested on an animal; it talks not about the past but about the present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will answer my hon. Friend in my final remarks, but the critical matter is not the testing of products, it is further upstream—it is the testing of ingredients in products. Very few retailers test products on animals; that almost never happens. However, the discriminating purchaser may want to know whether ingredients have been tested on animals. So the claim, "We do not test on animals" could be misleading. The whole point is that nobody has to say anything about animal testing on a product, but if they do, the information must be comprehensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May we have short interventions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was drawing my remarks to a conclusion, but now I am afraid I shall not. If we are obliged to have not only the whole truth but a contrived whole truth, there is hardly a chemical that comes into contact with humans that has not at some time been tested on animals. We will therefore oblige The Body Shop and others to list all the testing that has occurred in the past, or prevent them from ever making a statement about morality and the concern for animals that is at the very core of their existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By doing that, we return to the bolthole, if I may use that shorthand. We demean organisations such as The Body Shop and allow others to draw level with such moral organisations when they have no right to do so, because they still use animals for testing. There will be no difference between companies and organisations
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
that want to take a moral stance and not use animals for testing and those that could not care a monkey's—forgive the pun—and used animals for testing only last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is my concern, and if my hon. Friend the Minister wants my support, he will have to address it. Yes, we want the whole truth, but as the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) said, the whole truth can sometimes be misleading. There is a case for not going down the route that my hon. Friend proposes. Let us allow labels such as, "We do not use animals for testing our products" or "We do not use any products that have been tested on animals during the past 25 years"—or 50 years, or whatever period companies choose. There must be something to differentiate The Body Shop and its ilk from cowboy outfits that do not care at all about animal testing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.50 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dicks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not mean to intervene in the debate. I share most of the views that have been expressed but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford said, although the Body Shop is to be congratulated on not selling goods that have been tested on animals, it does sell goods that contain ingredients that were tested on animals some years ago. In other words, it sells products that have been animal tested—whether that was in 1950, 1921 or 1900 makes no difference. I see no problem in The Body Shop being in the forefront of not using animal-tested products, but it should admit that, through no choice of its own, it uses ingredients that were animal tested in 1921. If it wants to be the greatest thing since fish and chips, it should not use any ingredients that have been tested—the clarity and logic of its argument would then be apparent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot advocate one organisation because it now, rightly, does not use cosmetics tested on animals and at the same time run down other organisations that still use animal-tested products. Do not get me wrong; I have no time for such organisations and I am opposed to testing cosmetics on animals. I would prefer that, from tomorrow, no cosmetics were tested on animals, and to hell with the lady who cannot have the right shade of make-up because it cannot be tested on a monkey or some other animal. I could not care less about that, but I do care about the slightly confused logic of some hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Evans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Welwyn Hatfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that many people might get some comfort from the fact that the product that they were using had been tested on an animal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dicks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that there are some bemused people, even in the House of Commons, who would take a perverse pleasure in thinking that a product has been tested on an animal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not argue against using animals in medical testing, but I have always been opposed to the testing on animals of cosmetics that are put on the face of beauty queens, my wife or somebody else's mother-in-law. However, there is a confused logic. We cannot advocate buying a company's products because it does
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
not use cosmetics that have been tested on animals, because we might find in the small print that some of the ingredients have been tested. Either a company says that nothing that it uses has been tested on animals, or it says that something has—one cannot differentiate along the lines suggested by some hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.52 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have retreated a little in distance so that I can remain in the forefront of your attention, Mrs. Dunwoody. I take it that it is in order for me to speak, even though I am not in my usual position on the Front Bench.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Michael Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That's all right—we can hear you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is customary for the Minister to sit on the Front Bench, but he has my undivided attention anyway. To be serious for a moment, it is usual for the Minister to speak into the microphone above his head, which is why I insist that he faces the Chair. It is a matter not just of courtesy, but of record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well, of course I accept that, Mrs. Dunwoody. I find it uncomfortable trying to answer the perfectly proper questions of my hon. Friends with my back to them, but that is part of the configurational original sin of being a Minister in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking the comments of members of the Committee in no particular order, perhaps I may first engage with the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South, who made kind remarks about me? I should tell him that I admire his debating skill. If those who put products on the market want to make public statements distancing themselves from animal testing, they may. Furthermore, they may do so in their own terms. They may also want to deal with the subject of animal testing on the product label, although they do not have to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall retreat a little, and perhaps mend a fence with my hon. Friend the Member for Rochester, who will perhaps be more comfortable—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend mean Rochford?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do mean Rochford; I beg my hon. Friend's pardon. I shall have to retreat a little from my insistence on the whole truth, which has an Old Testament ring to it. I shall content myself with the less onerous stricture, "They must not mislead." That is probably the more comfortable position and, I think, the right one. After the 90 minutes of our deliberations, I shall rest more comfortably with the term, "They must not mislead", rather than the whole truth, which is perhaps a little harsh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel rightly said that the devil was in the detail. Before discussing that, I refer again to the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford. He asked whether the label could say, "Not tested on animals since 1926". The answer is yes, if that was true. He asked whether it could perhaps say, "Not tested on animals in the last 50 years", and my answer is again yes, if it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
was true. Another suggestion was, "We do not use animals to test our products". We could say that, but that would lead us into the twilight zone, and the consumer might think that none of the ingredients had been tested on animals. The fastidious consumer who wishes to be distanced from animal testing might care to know not merely whether the retailer had tested the product on animals but something about the ingredients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a retailer does not want to make any claim about animal testing, he need not do so. Forgetting the label on the product, a retailer can make his case against animal testing on his own terms as loudly and often as he likes. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel asked how long the postponement would be, if it happened. I think that the more worldly among us suspect that there will be a postponement. That has still to be discussed, but we will not support a lengthy postponement. The pressure must be kept up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South asked whether the words, "By or on behalf of the manufacturer, or with his actual or implied consent" could be added. The directive does not allow that limitation to be written into the regulations. It would open a possible loophole, in that manufacturers might still be relying on tests carried out by third parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the questions of which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South kindly gave me notice. If time runs out, I shall write to him with answers to his three specific questions. First, he asked whether we had taken any notice of the trade in framing our regulations. We have taken note of concerns expressed by the industry. There were problems over the late publication by the Commission of names to be used in ingredient labelling, and we drafted the regulations accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman asked about industrial espionage. The issue is not so much whether a test has been undertaken but whether manufacturers are aware of the test when making their claims. It is unlikely that a finished product would be tested by a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
third party. Animal tests must be licensed and properly justified. The rules require that industrial espionage is not regarded as a proper purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the hon. Gentleman asked whether the regulations require all companies that are still testing to include this information on the label. A requirement of this type could easily be evaded by the use of test results from third parties; it would therefore be ineffective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In concluding, I remind the Committee that this is a difficult issue; it has European, animal welfare and human safety components, all of which are tricky. I place the regulations before the Committee in all honesty, personally believing them to be the best reconciliation that can be achieved at this time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
