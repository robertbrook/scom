	<div class='legislation'>Draft Local Authorities (Contracting Out of Allocation of Housing and Homelessness Functions) Order 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. James Clappison)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Local Authorities (Contracting Out of Allocation of Housing and Homelessness Functions) Order 1996.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the draft Allocation of Housing Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 2753), and the Homelessness Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 2754).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It gives me great pleasure, Mr. Maxton, to serve on the Committee under your chairmanship. It may assist the Committee if I set out briefly the background to where the regulations fit into the scheme of the Housing Act 1996. They take forward its policies, the aim of which is to ensure that subsidised social housing is allocated on a fair basis to those who need it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three main objectives underly the policy. First, it will ensure that all allocations of long-term tenancies in social housing are made through a single mechanism—the new housing register. This will mean that everyone's needs are viewed together, whether they are statutorily homeless or on the waiting list. The second objective is to steer local authorities towards a broader view of housing need and homelessness. Under part VII of the 1966 Act, housing authorities will be required to ensure that advice and assistance are provided to all residents in their district who request it. This will help focus on the reasons why people lost their homes rather than dealing only with the effects of homes being lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third objective is to preserve, through the Housing Act 1996, the essential safety net of homelessness legislation which has been in place since 1977. The Housing (Homeless Persons) Act 1977 introduced the duty to accommodate any family or vulnerable person who was unintentionally homeless. In the 1996 Act the definitions of homelessness and threatened homelessness remain the same, as does the definition of priority need. On the whole, we are building part VII of the 1996 Act on earlier legislation. In these respects, the system remains the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interim duty to accommodate pending inquiries, essential for families who are thrown out of their homes, also continues to apply. The order differs from the 1977 legislation in that there is a new duty on local authorities to provide suitable accommodation for homeless families and vulnerable individuals for a
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
minimum period of two years. During this time, the longer-term needs of a homeless person or family will be assessed alongside those of others on the housing register. The difference between this and the previous system is that all needy households, the statutorily homeless, and others in need will be allocated long-term housing by the same criteria. The Committee may be familiar with the powers of local authorities when the two-year period ends and the duties that may fall upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much work has already been done towards implementing parts VI and VII of the 1996 Act. On 31 October my Department issued a code of guidance on those parts; on 30 October regulations on allocation of housing and on homelessness were made. These are the regulations that are being prayed against today. They set out detailed arrangements that give full effect to the provisions of the Act. It is essential that they be passed into law if local authorities are properly to implement the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Raynsford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that the orders must be passed if local authorities are to implement the Act. Will he give some thought to timetables? When the regulations were laid, the Government envisaged their becoming effective on 20 January, but I understand that the implementation date is to be 30 April 1997. Will the Minister please enlighten the Committee on the reasons for the change in the timetable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. It was originally intended that parts VI and VII would be implemented on 20 January. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that it was announced that part VII would still be implemented on 20 January, but that the implementation of part VI would be delayed until 1 April. That is because we listened to representations from local authorities, which told us that they were finding it difficult to get ready to implement the Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to answer the hon. Gentleman's first point before I respond to the second. He is aware of the background to the matter and the timetable of the Bill, which received its Royal Assent in late July. The hon. Gentleman is more familiar than most with the detailed debates that we had in the Standing Committee. There was widespread anticipation of the contents of the regulations. Local authorities had to prepare for the implementation of the Act. They received detailed guidance in October and thus had a considerable time for preparation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We listened to the representations that we received; it was important that the Bill should be implemented properly and sensibly and we agreed to delay the implementation of part VI until 1 April. The delay was approved as a sensible step by informed opinion in the housing world, including the Chartered Institute of Housing. It was the proper step in the circumstances, but we set it against the background of the time that local authorities have had to prepare. We want to ensure that the Bill is implemented properly and effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister please explain why the three statutory instruments before us today, including the one that relates to housing allocations, which he has told the Committee will not come into effect until 1 April, state clearly that they will come into force on 20 January?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows what the timetable is because I have just told him. The hon. Gentleman was, and remains, as anxious as anyone that we should get the policy right and have an appropriately informed debate on it. The reviews were published last week and the changes in the implementation date are contained in legislation. The hon. Gentleman is the last person to take account only of the technical detail; he knows that the implementation date for part VI, which relates to allocations from the register, will be 1 April. I shall be happy to deal with any other points that he may wish to make, but I want to say something about the regulations as they relate to allocations—the main feature of part VI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Allocation of Housing Regulations do several things. They set out cases in which allocations provisions do not apply; they set out which people who are subject to immigration control are entitled to appear on the housing register; they set out that most people who are owed a duty under the homeless legislation have a right to appear on the register; they set out that certain other people from abroad do not have the right to appear on the register and they lay down the information which must be contained on the register and the procedure that must be followed before someone can be removed from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Homelessness Regulations introduce several important measures. They make supplementary provisions for people who are subject to immigration control, but who are also eligible for assistance under the homelessness legislation; they specify other people from abroad who are not entitled to homelessness assistance; they set down the periods of notice which local authorities must give when they are to cease to accommodate someone beyond the two-year period; they specify a period during which the local authority cannot transfer responsibility for households which are placed out of the area to another authority. We debated that subject at length when we considered the Housing Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the affirmative resolution—the Local Authorities (Contracting Out of Allocation of Housing and Homelessness Functions) Order—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough and Horncastle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand one aspect of the homelessness regulations. Paragraph 4, which is entitled, "Descriptions of persons who are to be treated as persons from abroad ineligible for housing assistance", states that it applies to,
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person who is not habitually resident in the Common Travel Area other than—"</p></blockquote>
and lists exceptions that relate to EC regulations. Who will be covered by those regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that that interests my hon. Friend. My hon. Friend should examine paragraph 2 before he considers paragraph 4. Paragraph 2 defines the common travel area, which should be understood before considering paragraph 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To explain the matter broadly, people from within the common travel area are eligible for housing. The regulations refer to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person who is not habitually resident in the Common Travel Area",</p></blockquote>
but their effect is that people who are habitually resident in the common travel area—the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland—will be eligible. Those who are not habitually resident in the common travel area will not be eligible for homelessness assistance unless they fall into the categories enumerated in paragraph 4(a)(i) to (iii). In broad terms, the exceptions are people who work in Britain under European legislation. If my hon. Friend requires more detail, I shall be happy to provide it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Townend 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridlington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend explain why, in this day and age, it is necessary to treat the Republic of Ireland differently from other members of the EC?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend needs to examine benefit regulations. They align homelessness entitlement with benefit regulations when the criteria of the common travel area apply. My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. It has wider ramifications for other legislation and policies. My hon. Friend smiles. I think that he understands the purport of my answer. I hope that my hon. Friend and my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) understand the paragraph's aim. Someone who does not fall into the categories outlined in paragraph 4(a)(i) to (iii) will not be eligible for homelessness assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand the confusion of some Conservative Members. Paragraph 4 is drafted in an extraordinary way. It is based on three negatives. It contains not a double but a triple negative. It begins by describing people who are "ineligible"; it goes on to refer to people who are
	<br><blockquote><p>"not habitually resident in the Common Travel Area".</p></blockquote>
"Other than" constitutes the third negative. The wording is so opaque that it is understandable that Conservative Members who are suspicious of anything European are in a state over it. I urge the Minister to get out of this curious position by persuading his civil servants to write in plain English in future. They should express the regulations positively, and not use triple negatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Veterans of the Standing Committee which considered the Housing Bill will remember the comments that the hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford) made on the Bill's drafting. Those of us with non-technical minds found his comments interesting. I warn the Committee that if we seek improved drafting, we will not be able to conclude our proceedings in the time scale that we envisaged. On the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0273">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Housing Bill, the further drafting for which the hon. Gentleman called took some time to complete. Whatever the drafting, I hope that the hon. Member for Greenwich will accept that the measure will operate in the way that I described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move from the regulations on homelessness and on the allocation of housing to consideration of the contracting-out order. I hope that it will draw a warm glow of approbation from certain quarters of the Committee even though they may not approve of its drafting. The order will perform an important function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transfer of local authority housing stock—large-scale voluntary transfer as it is often known—is an excellent way to increase investment in local authority housing, and improve tenants' living conditions, by mobilising private finance. Since 1988, 53 authorities have transferred almost 233,000 dwellings, generating more than £3.7 billion in private finance. Transfer is the best way to get more investment in housing, to improve the condition of the stock and to offer tenants a higher standard of management. That all comes to pass when transfer takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants like transfers because they get an accelerated programme of repairs, guaranteed rent levels for up to five years and often closer tenant involvement in mangement. Local authorities also feel the benefits through large capital receipts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have introduced the order to enable authorities to contract out their executive functions under parts VI and VII of the Housing Act 1996. That will be particularly relevant to authorities that have transferred all or part of their stock to a registered social landlord under the large-scale voluntary transfer—LSVT—arrangements. It will also mean, however, that other authorities may participate in a common housing register run by another body if they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of an LSVT authority—an authority which has transferred its stock to a housing association or another registered social landlord—the registered social landlord has become, in effect, the main provider of social housing in the authority's area. The authority retains the strategic responsibility for ensuring that housing needs are met in its area and, in keeping with that, the order will enable an authority to contract out only executive functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, an authority will be able to contract out lettings under its allocation scheme, but it will itself have to set out the terms of the allocation scheme and decide which classes of persons are or are not qualifying persons entitled to appear on the register. Under section 72 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994, local authorities remain ultimately reponsible for functions carried out by the contractor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order needs to be made before enforcement of parts VI and VII of the 1996 Act in order to allow authorities to enter into new agreements with their registered social landlords. In accordance with the requirements of the Deregulation and Contracting
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Out Act 1994, we consulted local authority associations in England and Wales in October and we received no objections to the proposals set out in the order. Copies of the Department's consultation letter and a list of reponses have been placed in the Libraries of each House. Copies of the reponses have been placed in the Department's library.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is welcomed by local government generally and it is needed by local authorities who have transferred stock. I commend it and the two sets of regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.48 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister has made clear, we are dealing with three statutory instruments. The link between them is that they all relate to homelessness. They arise from the Housing Act 1996, which made far-reaching changes to the framework under which local authorities have responsibilities to assist the homeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, of course, immense need for such provisions. The numbers of homeless people in Britain are currently recorded in official statistics at about 120,000. That is double the number officially recorded as homeless in 1979 when the Government came into power. Many people—mainly single and childless—are not recorded because they do not approach a local authority, but they are also homeless. The most extreme examples of them sleep rough on our streets. They are a visible reminder of the existence of deprivation and homelessness in our society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The framework established in 1977 has lasted 19 years and has been almost universally regarded as sensible and effective. When the Government proposed the changes in the Housing Act 1996, there was a hugely revealing response to their consultation. Some 10,000 organisations and individuals responded, an overwhelmingly large response to any consultation exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 10,000 almost unanimously told the Government not to do what they proposed. It was not only the local authorities, or just the housing associations, or just the voluntary organisations or just the churches. It was the entire range of organisations that understand the problem and the needs of homeless people. And they all said, "Don't do it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their characteristic way, the Government chose to ignore all who had some experience in the field and to proceed with legislation that is uncalled for and will have very damaging consequences for homeless people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government would have us believe —the Minister followed the line in his introductory remarks—that we have before us merely a rearrangement of priorities for the allocation of social housing. Reading the proceedings of the Committee that considered the Housing Bill, I found exactly the same line being adopted by his right hon. Friend, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration, the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry). He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Let us get one thing clear. The Bill will not change the supply of social housing so the proposals will have no effect on the number of families allocated to social housing in a given year."</p></blockquote>
We challenged that Minister on that point. I said to him then:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not accept his premise. His assumption that somehow there will be no change in supply—that it will be merely a matter of adjustment between different routes—is wrong. We know what the Government are doing. They have cut the housing programme remorselessly in recent years. We have seen the Housing Corporation budget cut by £300 million last year and by £300 million the year before that. We have seen the local authority housing investment programme cut again and again. Output of social housing is at its lowest level since the end of the war. By weakening the obligations to the homeless, all that we will do is provide the Treasury with more excuses to cut the housing programme even further. The Bill will merely open the way for more cuts in the housing programme and fewer homes for everyone, whether they are on the waiting list or homeless."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 21 March 1996; c. 785-6.]</p></blockquote>
I was clearly apprehensive then about the implications of the Housing Act. But even I did not expect the savage cuts made to the housing programme in the Budget. Those cuts prompted the chairman of the Housing Corporation—a Government appointment—to protest at their damaging consequences for homeless and badly housed people. If press reports are to be believed, the cuts led him to offer his resignation because he had undertaken the job on the understanding that he would have a programme, an understanding that the Budget rudely destroyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background to this evening's deliberations. Savage cuts have drastically reduced the number of homes available for people in housing need, whether homeless or on waiting lists.

Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), repeated two weeks ago, that we will make those funds available to ensure that homes can be provided for the homeless.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Townend</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell me where the £5 billion will come from?

The Government have slashed investment in housing and have betrayed people in housing need, be they homeless or badly housed. The Government have made it quite clear that they are willing to sacrifice the interests of the homeless and the badly housed to their own short-term electoral considerations. Cuts in housing investment to try to convince the electorate that they are a Government worth re-electing are entirely in vain, I can assure them.

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
The first of the three statutory instruments before us deals with the allocation of housing. It is somewhat curious because it tells us that it comes into force on 20 January. Paragraph 1, the citation and commencement, reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These Regulations may be cited as the Allocation of Housing Regulations 1996 and shall come into force on 20th January 1997."</p></blockquote>
We have heard from the Minister that they will not come into force on that date, and I look forward to hearing the Minister tell us why we are invited to agree something that is manifest nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can assist the hon. Gentleman and save the Committee some time fleshing out with a little more particularity what I was suggesting to him earlier. The commencement date will be 1 April. To put the complete gloss on the detail, statutory instrument 3221 containing regulations and decisions on homelessness review which was made last week but has not yet been printed changes the commencement date of statutory instrument 2753 from 20 January to 1 April. I hope that will satisfy the hon. Gentleman's appetite for particularity in technical details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to know that the Minister has found a way of getting out of his embarrassment on this issue. But we are considering regulations which say one thing when we are told that something quite different will happen. This is not uncommon with the Government. I look forward to seeing how many other bits of nonsense we shall encounter as we go through these regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background to the change of date is well known. The Government imposed a completely unrealistic timetable which made it impossible to consult, as they had promised. They therefore breached their pledge to consult about the regulations before making them. They would even so have gone ahead had they not been faced—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.59 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee was suspended, I was explaining the arrangements under which the timetable had been changed because the Government had been confronted with the threat of legal action by two local authorities. One of those, interestingly, was the City of Westminster—not normally renowned for its opposition to the Government. It was so exasperated by the impossibly tight timetable set by the Government that it threatened legal action if it was not amended. That is why paragraph 1 of the regulations is inaccurate, and the measure will come into effect on 1 April, not 1 January.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Paragraph 2 concerns interpretation, so no points of substance arise, but I note the significance of the reference to the group known as EEA nationals. That term is defined as meaning
	<br><blockquote><p>"a national of a State which is a Contracting Party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area signed at Oporto on 2nd May 1992 as adjusted by the Protocol signed at Brussels on 17th March 1993".</p></blockquote>
In case I provoke an outcry in Committee, I shall not say more about the possible European implications other than to note the strange complexities of the statutory instruments with which we have to deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3 brings us to the meat of the regulations, as it sets out the groups to whom part IV of the Housing Act 1996 does not apply. The types of people mentioned are existing tenants transferring to other accommodation, people who are being rehoused under the Land Compensation Act 1973 and people who are being rehoused from defective dwellings. All those are sensible exclusions, which we debated in Committee at the appropriate time. However, we also debated other exclusions. The Minister confirmed in Committee, on 12 March at column 609, in response to Opposition amendments, that certain categories of people who were nominated by social services or health authorities to go into housing should not be subject to the common allocation rules through a common register. He accepted that there was a case for exemption in such instances, said that he would give sympathetic consideration to including them in the regulations that would follow, and invited Opposition Members to withdraw the amendments. On that undertaking I did so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations before us make no mention of the categories of people that I have listed—those referred by social service or health authorities, or those leaving hostel accommodation, who need to be rehoused directly in council housing. If the Minister assures us that regulations to the effect that I outlined will be presented, I shall be happy. Otherwise, there will have been a straightforward breach of an undertaking, given in Committee, that account would be taken of the groups to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4 of the allocation regulations sets out the groups that are debarred from consideration for housing, giving effect to the mean-minded and vindictive measures that the Government introduced primarily against asylum seekers, which will result in severe injustices. Already we know of people being left destitute and homeless as a result of the Government's action—to the extent that courts have found it impossible to accept the outcome and have reached decisions under which social services departments are in the unenviable position of being expected to help people to whom benefits cannot legally now be paid. Apart from the issue of basic humanity, there is also the question whether it is right to deny allocations to people who are in the United Kingdom on terms which make them subject to an agreement not to receive public funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implication of that is interesting and I hope that the Minister will explain it. Are the Government implying that having a council tenancy involves being in receipt of public funds? Any fair minded observer
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
looking at the current state of public housing finances would realise that council housing is making a profit; there is a net flow of funds from council tenants to the Exchequer. The general housing subsidies going to council subsidies total almost £720 million whereas the clawback of housing benefit through the housing revenue account is £1.2 billion for the current years. Far from receiving public funds, council tenants are contributing to the Treasury. Why should individuals be debarred access to council housing on the basis that they would be in receipt of public funds? I should have thought the Minister would recognise the merit of having more people contribute to the Treasury because of the net flow to the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The homelessness regulations No. 2754 follow broadly similar lines and highlight the exclusions from assistance under part VII of the Act. There is, of course, the familiar exclusion of asylum seekers who have not made an application on arrival at the port of entry. This is an extraordinary harsh and unjust rule whose consequences for constituents a number of hon. Members have highlighted. Many of these people arrive in the country often late at night, confused and sometimes unable to speak English. I well recall one such person who did not make an application at the port of entry because he had no way of knowing at the time that that was what he should do. His application two days later was apparently not good enough for Her Majesty's Government, who would regard someone in those circumstances as a bogus asylum seeker. What nonsense, what an inhumane measure and how shameful for our country that such a system is being perpetuated by the provisions of the orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contracting-out regulations raise different issues about which one point of principle should be covered. A conflict of interest can arise where a local authority contracts out its responsibilities for allocation of housing and its homelessness functions to another body. If that other body happens to be providing housing in the area, it could in certain circumstances be both acting as an agent for the authority in determining whether someone should be allocated housing, and receiving he or she as a provider of housing. I have in mind a housing association or a private housing company, both of which offered services to the authority and provided housing in an area. Is it right that they be put in a position of judging whether it was appropriate for someone to move into a particular type of accommodation which they also provide?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the draft regulations were first prepared for consultation with the local authority associations, they excluded the possibility of allowing an organisation that had assumed functions under them to carry out reviews of entitlement because there was perceived to be a conflict of interest. That proposal has disappeared from these orders. Will the Minister say whether he accepts that there is a conflict of interest and, if he does, whether he also accepts that it is a dangerous precedent to set?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have covered some issues of detail in the orders and spelt out our objections in principle to what the Government are doing about homelessness. I look
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
forward to the change of Government that will follow a general election when, as my right hon. Friend, the Leader of the Opposition made clear in his speech two weeks ago, Labour will restore a proper statutory framework, with the emphasis on securing permanent accommodation for homeless people. That will end this shabby little interlude at the fag end of a discredited Government's life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.24 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Littleborough and Saddleworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Hon. Member for Greenwich and I had the pleasure of attending a conference in Chester last week at which aspects of these housing measures were discussed. We discussed the politics of housing in the morning and I understand from the chairman, to whom I spoke later, that the delegates, who were experts on housing matters, mostly from housing associations and local authorities, left for lunch in a good frame of mind, positive and buoyed up by the fact that soon people in positions of influence would have a different approach to housing from that of the past 17 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the afternoon, however, the conference discussed the detail and application of the 1996 Act, and the chairman tells me that the delegates, who are responsible for putting into practice the terms of legislation, left in a depressed frame of mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That shows how unwelcome the Act has been with those at the coal face and how the Government's claim that the legislation is necessary is bogus. The reality, as has been said many times on the Floor of the House and in Committee, is that the Act will cause massive confusion and hardship. It is a sad, though amusing, fact that the Government's thinking is so flawed that they cannot even get the dates right on the draft orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government said that the implementation of the measure will be put back by three months. I listened with interest to the comments of the hon. Member for Greenwich and I acknowledge his expertise. Having deferred implementation by three months, why do not the Government save themselves bother and grief by putting it back another three months and let someone else clear up the mess?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.27 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already dealt with the timing and I shall not delay the Committee any longer on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich referred to the regulations and to the other referrals. He told the Committee that he was expecting other categories in paragraph 3 of the allocation regulations. I can tell him that we are not planning any further regulations, but that is not a breach of what we said in Committee originally. It is merely that we intend to achieve the same result but in a different way. It has always been our intention to ensure that referrals by social services departments, people with special needs or those leaving hostels for rough sleepers—the categories to which the hon. Gentleman adverted—should be safeguarded with the new allocation arrangements. In the light of discussions with local authorities, however,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
we have reconsidered the provisions in part VI and concluded that they allow an authority to enter into referral arrangements as part of its allocation scheme if it so wishes. It would be unnecessary, and possibly confusing, to make regulations treating referral arrangements outside part VI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many authorities set aside a quota of anticipated allocations for groups with particular characteristics, perhaps allocating accommodation on the basis of referrals from social services departments, welfare bodies or specialised agencies dealing with rough sleepers. Such quotas can form part of an authority's strategy to intergrate the prvision of housing with other social policies—for example, as part of a care-in-the-community package or to enable individuals to move on from a temporary hostel. It is inherent in section 167 of the Housing Act 1996 that authorities retain that discretion, providing that the people who are subject to such arrangements fall within one of the categories of reasonable preference set out in subsection (2) of that section.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am partly reassured by what the Minister said. Will he please enlighten the Committee on why it is felt necessary for the regulations to specify people who are rehoused under section 39 of the Land Compensation Act 1973, and people who are rehoused from properties that were defined as defective dwelling houses? Why are they specifically exempted in legislation if it is not necessary to do the same for those who have been rehoused as a result of nomination agreements through social services, voluntary organisations or a health authority? That seems bizarre to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's question. However, if he reflects upon it, he will see that the characteristics of the categories referred to in paragraph 3 are somewhat different. For example, they cover people who already have secure tenancies in other parts of the United Kingdom. If they have a secure tenancy elsewhere, they may not fall within the ambit of section 167 and the categories to which reasonable preference is given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister looks closely at paragraph 3(4), he will see that it refers to former owner-occupiers, not just statutory or secure tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It refers to a number of categories, but the hon. Gentleman should bear in mind the underlying point. A degree of flexibility is necessary to meet the needs of the categories to which he referred—people who have left hostels and those with special needs who have been referred by social services. We think that those needs can best be met under the legislation as it stands and without further regulations. Indeed, it would be difficult to achieve the same degree of flexibility for such categories through regulation. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurances on what we are seeking to achieve and on how we intend to go about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
The next point made by the hon. Member for Greenwich was about asylum seekers. He highlighted them in the context of the allocation, not the homelessness, regulations. He will see that some categories of asylum seekers fall within the scope of the homelessness regulations. Therefore, they are owed a duty under the homelessness legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will have to accept, however, that the allocation regulations deal with an entirely different subject. The position of asylum seekers is different under those regulations, given that they may be in this country on a short-term basis and may be waiting for their cases to be dealt with. Therefore, it is not sensible for them to appear under the allocation regulations, but there is a case for them to be covered—as in fact they are—by the homelessness regulations. Some categories may be owed a duty under them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman's point about social housing. He said that a profit was being made from letting out social housing facilities. I shall read his comments with interest, but I think that there was a degree of sophistry in them. The hon. Gentleman is nodding his head and smiling in an endearing manner, so I take it that his remarks were not intended to be sophisticated. However, they underestimated the value of the public expenditure that is put into the provision of social housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Social housing is widely regarded as a valuable social resource, and the hon. Gentleman mentioned the scale of, and the controversy about, expenditure in the housing programme. He knows that valuable public funds have been going into both housing association and, originally, local authority propeties. Those properties are a public resource and we have an interest in ensuring that they are used properly in order to meet the needs of those who require social housing. The regulations achieve that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a wider point about capital receipts and suggested an alternative policy. I shall observe your injunction, Mr. Maxton, and will not stray too widely, but I should like to answer the hon. Gentleman's points about the housing programme. When the hon. Gentleman said that he would pay for more social housing from capital receipts, he stirred up a hornet's nest. On reflection, he may regret his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not an accountant, but I see implications for public sector borrowing in the hon. Gentleman's suggestion. The set-aside rules reduce the burden on council tax payers and rent payers of servicing local authority debt. It is a myth that capital receipts can be spent without any effect on public expenditure. Releasing them would raise public expenditure and would require an increase in the public sector borrowing requirement, cuts elsewhere or increased taxation. That is not a pain-free, cost-free option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point was made about the piggy bank that is rattling around. It may be in the wrong place. As the hon. Member for Greenwich knows, many authorities that have capital receipts are in wealthier areas which have less clear housing needs. Some authorities that have the greatest housing needs have no capital
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0278">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
receipts. We have yet to hear from the hon. Gentleman how redistribution will take place between the authorities. I am sure that the ratepayers of Barnet and Enfield will be interested to know how their receipts will be redistributed to, say, Lambeth. That is causing some embarrassment to the hon. Gentleman, so I shall move quickly on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Not at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman denies it, but he put little flesh on those bones. He will have to do better than praying in aid the capital receipts. I have heard them spent many times over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister's comments may or may not be causing the hon. Gentleman some embarrassment, but they are way out of order. Will the Minister return to the orders before us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, I join the hon. Gentleman in what he said about homelessness. Although I take some issue with him, I regard it as an important function of government to meet social and housing needs. We are no less committed than he is to alleviating homelessness. He will be pleased to note that during the life of the Government there has been promising evidence of a reduction in homelessness. I am sure that he will welcome that. He referred to people sleeping on the streets. He will join me in welcoming the success of the rough sleepers initiative in taking many kids off the street. We have a proper social housing policy. The regulations contribute to that policy by fleshing out the Housing Act 1996. They are sensible regulations, foreshadowed by that Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
