Draft Social Security (Incapacity for Work and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Social Security and Disabled People (Mr. Alistair Burt)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Social Security (Incapacity for Work and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1996.</p></blockquote>
I am delighted to welcome you, Sir David, as Chairman of this Committee.<br><br>
The Regulations before the Committee today represent the first changes to the legislation since incapacity benefit was introduced in April 1995. They include a number of tidying-up measures and points of clarification which we have identified over the first 18 months of operating and monitoring the new arrangements. In addition, we are taking this opportunity to respond to a recent judgment by the High Court. That decision concerned the beneficial provision contained in regulation 27 of the Incapacity Benefit (General) regulations, which allows people with certain conditions who would otherwise fail the all work test to be treated as incapable of work.<br><br>
We are debating these regulations today under the agreed special procedures for parliamentary scrutiny which were laid down in the Social Security (Incapacity For Work) Act 1994. These require regulations made under certain powers in the Act within four years of Royal Assent, however minor, to be passed by affirmative resolution of each House. Opposition Members were central to the development of that procedure, which ensures that, while the new system is bedding down, any changes will be formally debated by Parliament.<br><br>
The introduction of incapacity benefit last year represented a major reform of the benefits for people who are incapable of working because of the effects of an illness or disability. Experience has shown that when introducing any reform of this magnitude there will always be a need for some fine-tuning in the light of practical operational experience. To a large extent that is what these regulations provide. They introduce a number of changes to three sets of the regulations which contain the detailed rules for determining entitlement to benefits for incapacity: the Social Security (Incapacity For Work) (General) Regulations 1995; the Social Security (Incapacity Benefit) Transitional Regulations 1995, and the Social Security (Overlapping Benefits) Regulations 1979.<br><br>
I should say at the outset that none of the amendments we are considering today introduces any significant changes to our established policy in this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
area. I have written to members of the Committee with a summary of what each of the regulations sets out to do, and I hope that that will assist our debate.<br><br>
Included are amendments which are directly beneficial in nature; others, by clarifying the existing regulations, will ensure consistent application of the all work test procedures. I hope that they will be recognised as such and welcomed by all hon. Members. An example is the proposed amendment to the current provision which allows incapacity benefit recipients to care for a close relative without that being treated as work, which could affect benefit entitlement. The amendment broadens the definition of "close relative" to include, among others, spouse, grandparents and grandchildren.<br><br>
Another beneficial measure concerns the long established provision under which people who refuse to undergo medical treatment which might improve their condition may be disqualified from benefit. We are restricting the circumstances in which that provision can be used, to ensure that it can only be considered in respect of treatment that has been recommended by the claimant's own doctor or hospital.<br><br>
The new all work test of incapacity is, of course, the key to the reforms that we introduced last year. We have therefore been monitoring its application very closely, and have undertaken a number of exercises to assess the experience of the Benefits Agency doctors and adjudication officers who have been applying the test over the first 18 months of live running. The detailed activities and descriptors which make up the all work test, and which allow the claimant and the doctor to express the extent of someone's physical and mental impairment in specific functional areas, are set out in the schedule to the general regulations. Our monitoring has shown that, in a few areas, the wording of some of these activities and descriptors needs to be more precise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stratford-on-Avon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that he attaches great importance to the evidence obtained from doctors employed by the Benefits Agency medical service. Will he say why he has just announced that he is lowering the standards required of doctors recruited by that service?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not lowering the standard: we are widening the range of doctors who can be used by the Benefits Agency medical service. We want to broaden the criteria for the experience required of doctors before recruitment to the service. The previous regulations demanded five years' experience of general practice, which ruled out some doctors whose experience might have been in hospitals but who had sufficient knowledge of the areas of functional limitation to make them useful in dealing with the test. That is the reason for the change. I can say more about that later, but I do not want it to be thought that there has in any way been a lowering of standards.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0358">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Stanley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tonbridge and Malling)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that my hon. Friend said that he had sent members of the Committee an explanatory letter about the regulations. I regret that I have not received one. Can he arrange for copies to be made available?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to help my right hon. Friend as quickly as I can by giving him a copy of the letter.<br><br>
Having identified the areas I have mentioned, we sought advice from the Department's lawyers and medical advisers as to how we might improve the wording. In doing so our aim has been to ensure that the amendments more accurately reflect the original policy intention. Hon. Members may recall that that was established in the light of a consensus agreed following the development work for the test, which included assistance from a panel of 80 experts appointed to help with its detailed design. I reassure the Committee that none of those improvements represents any tightening of the functional descriptors in the test beyond the original policy intention.<br><br>
I can perhaps best illustrate the sort of amendment proposed by giving an example. One of the functional areas assessed under the all work test is manual dexterity. The activities specified in that area measure a person's ability to perform various tasks with his hands. We want to make it clear that the ability to turn a tap refers to an ordinary sink tap; and that the word "control" in the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"control knobs on a cooker"</p></blockquote>
is intended to be an adjective, not a verb. That is the sort of detail into which the regulations go.<br><br>
Several of the activities in the test relate to an inability to perform particular tasks with either hand, or with either arm. We want to make it clear that those references relate to disabilities in both hands or arms, rather than in one or the other. Separate descriptors are, of course, specified to assess people with disabilities in just one hand or arm.<br><br>
We are also making absolutely clear the general requirement, already set out in the regulations, for the award of points under the all work test to be linked to the existence of a medical condition.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will acknowledge the importance of removing such areas of ambiguity in which a lack of precision in the original drafting might lead to an inconsistent application of the test.<br><br>
I turn to the effects of the High Court decision to which I referred earlier. It concerned the application of the beneficial provision in regulation 27 of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995. We recognised from our work in developing the all work test of incapacity that a minority of claimants who are clearly incapable of work could fail the test because their current condition causes only limited functional impairment. Regulation 27 allows a person who fails the test still to be treated as incapable of work if the examining doctor considers that one of the specified exceptional medical circumstances applies.<br><br>
The question of whether not one of those circumstances applies is, of course, a medical one. That is why the application of the provision was conditional
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
on the recommendation of the examining doctor. The High Court decided, however, that it was wrong to make the doctor's opinion binding on the adjudication officer. The practical effect of the judgment is that lay adjudication officers and social security appeal tribunals are no longer bound by the examining doctor's opinion on the application of regulation 27 and can take into account other evidence when considering whether exceptional circumstances apply.<br><br>
We are amending the provision in the light of the court's decision to assist the adjudicating authorities in their determination of the question. The proposed wording more clearly defines the circumstances in which that exceptional provision applies. Adjudication officers will still be required to take account of the examining doctor's opinion. That must be right, given that we are talking about a specialist medical question; but they will also be able to consider other medical evidence—for example, that provided by the claimant's doctor—and give preference to such evidence if they consider that it outweighs that of the examining doctor.<br><br>
The all work test arrangements are fair in principle and in application. The draft regulations introduce important fine-tuning to those arrangements and I commend them to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.39 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I echo the Minister's sentiments about your being in the Chair, Sir David.<br><br>
I am always slightly apprehensive when a Minister whom I greatly respect comes to the Committee suggesting that all that is on offer will be a significant improvement for claimants the length and the breadth of the nation. I suspect that when we look at the regulations in more detail, we may find that they will not help claimants, but will narrow criteria for eligibility for benefits.<br><br>
Although the Minister talked about small changes, minor amendments and easing up the system, all the small changes that we increasingly see in regulations brought before the House add up, of course, to significant changes affecting claimants' daily activities in the benefits culture. It is important when we are dealing with regulations to put them in a wider context and recognise that small changes can add up to considerable developments.<br><br>
First, the regulations before us today, and many that have emerged previously, shift the balance of advantage from individuals to the Government. In a democracy, we should be concerned about that. Secondly, such regulations create obstacles in the path of benefits claimants. The overwhelming majority are claiming benefits which they are fully eligible to obtain. But regulations are often aimed at narrowing the criteria for eligibility. Imperceptible changes, when viewed over a long period, can add up to significant change. Thirdly, regulations create more and more powers for Secretaries of States to intervene.<br><br>
A fourth point which is causing me great concern is that regulations and legislation are based on an assumption that people are not deserving or genuine.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0359">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
If such a culture is created within the benefits system, people who genuinely need to claim can be discouraged from doing so because they do not want to experience the indignity attached to some aspects of the all work test.<br><br>
It is important to provide the context for our specific concerns. There are three issues that I want to address. The first is regulation 27, the second is the amended physical descriptors and the third is the sensitive issue of mental illness.<br><br>
Regulation 27(b) of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 covers exceptional circumstances where it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Although a claimant may not satisfy the all work test, he or she may still be treated as incapable of work in specific circumstances, as approved by a doctor approved by the Secretary of State";</p></blockquote>
This applied when
<br><blockquote><p>"he suffers from some specific disease or bodily or mental disablement and, by reasons of such disease or disablement, there would be a substantial risk to the mental or physical health of any person if he were found capable of work".</p></blockquote>
In practice, the existing regulations allow claimants with progressive illnesses such as severe heart conditions to be treated as incapable of work. It was accepted that claimants with long-term, potentially life-threatening illnesses could not return to the work place. The proposed amendment to regulation 27 makes no mention of the risk to new claimants in a similar position.<br><br>
An article in the <i>Daily Mirror</i> on 14 November illustrated that point. It is a dramatic piece, and I am not using the drama to suggest that all cases are like this. The headline read,
<br><blockquote><p>"Heart Man Dies After 'Back To Work' Order",</p></blockquote>
and the article said:
<br><blockquote><p>"A heart patient collapsed and died after being told he must find a job or lose his state benefits. Stricken David Holmes, 54, had another heart attack which friends believe was brought on by distress over his treatment by Government bureaucrats."</p></blockquote>
That gentleman was certainly not fit for work and died a week after undergoing the stress of the all work test. That is an extreme situation, but it underlines the fact that the regulations that we had before provided important protection. We have to go beyond a hard all work test to recognise that there are issues of people's general state of health. If we dismiss those, there could be serious consequences.<br><br>
In the eyes of the disability lobby in particular, regulation 2(9) is an extremely damaging change to the exceptional circumstances in which a disabled person who does not pass the all work test can still be deemed incapable of work. There are currently four such exceptional circumstances, but the new regulations reduce them to three. They eliminate the condition of a person who
<br><blockquote><p>"suffers from some specific disease or bodily or mental disablement"</p></blockquote>
where it was deemed that
<br><blockquote><p>"by reasons of such disease … there would be a substantial risk."</p></blockquote>
The Disability Law Service argues for the retention of that condition because some disabling conditions might not allow a person to score sufficient points on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
the all work test, but might still make it impossible for him to work without his condition seriously deteriorating. The Government should bear that important consideration in mind when they make changes that seem minor on the surface, but which can be deadly for claimants.<br><br>
The second issue that I want to stress is the amendment of the schedule of physical descriptors in 3(b) to 3(e). Original descriptor 3(b) awards 15 points against the scoring system when a person cannot
<br><blockquote><p>"sit comfortably for more than 10 minutes without having to move from the chair."</p></blockquote>
The amended descriptor reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Cannot sit comfortably for more than 10 minutes without having to move from the chair because the degree of discomfort makes it impossible to continue sitting."</p></blockquote>
I sometimes think that I do not have the intellect to understand the regulations that emanate from the Department— [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am grateful and reassured that the Government Whip has kindly suggested from a sedentary position that I do have the intellect—perhaps other factors are at work, then.<br><br>
That is just one of the changes, but alterations have been made to another four descriptors. Why is it that when the knife is put in, it has to be twisted? What is the game plan behind some of the regulations? Of course, the Government have to save money—that is the raison d'être behind the proposals. There has been a huge expansion in the regulations governing incapacity benefit and its predecessor, invalidity benefit. We are, however, dealing with real people, and I would be grateful if the Minister dealt with the slight changes before us, which could have devastating consequences for those involved.<br><br>
The third issue that I want to discuss is mental illness. The original regulation 10 in the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 covered people with a severe mental condition who should be treated as incapable of work. Regulation 10(2)(e)(viii) verified that a person shall be treated as incapable of work if a doctor who is approved by the Secretary of State certifies that he is suffering from "a severe mental illness". The amended and much expanded regulation stipulates that such an individual should be treated as incapable of work should he suffer from
<br><blockquote><p>"a severe mental illness, involving the presence of mental disease, which severely and adversely affects a person's mood or behaviour, which severely restricts the social functioning, or his awareness of his immediate environment."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will explain why there is such an expanded definition. Is it perhaps too prescriptive; and what is the definition of a mental disease? In their haste, the Government are pushing into regulations definitions which would be accepted by few experts in the field. Many of the lobbies that work day in and day out on behalf of claimants would not accept those definitions. Once again therefore we must deal with changes of words and small modifications that may have significant consequences for eligibility criteria.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0360">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
In dealing with mental illness it is important to adopt a higher level of sensitivity. I appreciate that we are dealing with vast sums of taxpayers' money, but we are also dealing with people who have severe problems and who should be given maximum credibility.<br><br>
The Minister should address himself to the definitions and the impact of the changes that he is about to implement in January. They will not enhance incapacity benefit but will detract from the Government's efforts to achieve the requisite fairness, equity and high degree of sensitivity.</span></p>
<p>4.51 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Liz Lynne <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rochdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I too welcome you, Sir David, as Chairman. The Minister has claimed that many of the provisions are simply tidying-up measures. So they are, but they also have worrying aspects. I am particularly worried that life-threatening conditions have to be discovered by the Benefits Agency medical services doctors. In the past, any consultant could establish whether someone had such a condition. Some of the BAMS doctors may be very good but the abilities and skills of others may be fairly mixed. According to the British Medical Association on Friday, following a written parliamentary answer on the 12th of this month, the situation could get worse. The Minister touched on it briefly, but I would have preferred rather more enlightenment. The BMA is obviously not convinced by his argument.<br><br>
The Government say now that only three years is needed for post-registration experience; yet, in the past, eight years were required for such experience. That is worrying, especially since the BMA Council is now advising doctors not to take on work for BAMS. The Minister may not be aware of that but, if he is, he should tell the Committee his view about it. If doctors do not carry out work for BAMS, who on earth will carry out the medical examinations?<br><br>
The Minister knows that the all work test has denied many people much benefit to which they should be entitled. Moreover, 50 per cent. of cases are won on appeal. That shows that something is seriously wrong with the original judgements. Consultants' letters are not taken into account in the original tests. If a claimant turns up with a consultant's letter from a hospital saying that he or she is ill and is unable to work, why should it not be taken into account? It will be taken into account during the appeals procedure—I am glad that the Minister mentioned that in his opening remarks.<br><br>
I know of cases where the doctor will not sign patients off the sick, so what happens then? They go along to try to get work but cannot sign on for it because their own doctor has not signed them off. There are several such examples. I shall not detain the Committee for long, but I want to mention a case in Rochdale. Eight years ago, Mr. Hooper, one of my constituents, was shot in an armed robbery and has not been able to work since. He still has an open wound in his back which has to be dressed twice a day. He is registered as 20 per cent. disabled. Mrs Hooper claims that her husband was never examined properly by the BAMS doctor. She also claims that her local GP
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
would agree that her husband is unable to work. Yet Mr. Hooper was denied incapacity benefit, even though he had an open wound in his back which had to be dressed twice daily.<br><br>
Another case was referred to me by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, which said that it was one of the most horrific cases of which it was currently aware. A man was initially awarded just three points by the BAMS doctors but was awarded 58 points by the tribunal on appeal. As we know, 15 points is the qualifying level for incapacity benefit. Most disturbing is the fact that the tribunal revealed that, initially, on six separate grounds he was awarded three points but the BA MS doctor then changed his mind. One can only speculate as to why he changed his mind—wrongly—on so many grounds. Was he perhaps under pressure to fail a minimum proportion of the people that he assessed? That appears to be the case.<br><br>
I repeat that almost 50 per cent. of claims are granted on appeal. If the Government want to save money, they could start by saving money on appeals and ensuring that BAMS doctors know what they are doing and take evidence from medical practitioners, whether GPs or consultants. I wish that that would happen. It is extremely worrying that incapacity benefit is being denied to so many people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Without being unnecessarily disputatious, I think that the hon. Lady will be aware that the success/failure ratio of appeals under the previous system was very similar to what it is now. She has maintained before that a quota is being applied, but there is not. The number of successful appeals is reasonably similar to that in the past. Does not the hon. Lady agree that the rules are simply being applied similarly?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Lynne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister cannot be happy with the fact that almost 50 per cent. of cases are won on appeal. Whatever the situation was before, it does not mean to say that the situation is right now. If the Government want to save money, they should make sure that the original benefit claim is examined properly and, if appropriate, granted. I quoted a case from NACAB but there are reports from different organisations throughout the country of people with real problems, such as the man in my constituency who had a gaping wound in his back but was denied incapacity benefit.<br><br>
The Minister cannot complacently say, "Things are no different now from what we had before". He is the Minister responsible. He must address the problems and ensure that incapacity benefit is awarded to genuine claimants not just on appeal but when they have their original test. We want to achieve that, not a 50 per cent. successful appeal rate. The Minister ought to think again about incapacity benefit and the all work test generally, but he must specifically reexamine the regulations.</span></p>

<p>4.58 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government have sought to suggest that the alteration to the regulations that we are considering is of fairly minor import. The explanatory note from the Department emphasized—</span></p>
<p>4.59 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>5.10 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the suspension I was about to make the point that the Department's explanatory note hardly led us to expect significant changes to the regulations. However, such changes are proposed and although we are grateful to the Minister for his child's guide—a crib—to them he does not give us any clue as to their significance.<br><br>
It is a little premature for the Government to introduce such substantial changes. The take-on of cases has proved to be slower than anticipated and the report on and analysis of the all work test evaluation is to be published early in the new year. Would not it have been more appropriate to allow hon. Members the opportunity to study the findings before asking us to comment on the specific changes?<br><br>
It is particularly important that regulations under the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) Act 1994 should be carefully scrutinised by Parliament. The primary legislation was justifiably criticised as a skeleton Bill—it provided broad-brush powers—and a great deal of the important detail was left to be amplified in secondary legislation. We face a difficulty because, by convention, statutory instruments are not amendable.<br><br>
That does not have to be so, however. The Procedure Committee in its first report—admittedly a number of years ago, in 1977–78—suggested that, while there should not be a wholesale move to amendable statutory instruments,
<br><blockquote><p>"There may, however, be occasions when it would be desirable for the house to be given an oportunity to express a view on delegated legislation which the Government intend to lay before Parliament, but before it is formally laid. This practice is already frequently followed in respect of Northern Ireland Orders, when they are debated in the Northern Ireland Committee in their preliminary of 'Proposal' form. A similar procedure might prove advantageous in respect of other statutory instruments containing major legislative provisions."</p></blockquote>
Having a formal opportunity to scrutinise and to amend draft regulations before they were laid in their definitive form could be another, perhaps more useful, way of dealing with the problem. However, the Government do not choose to proceed in that basis. That is a pity, but it means that there is an obligation on us to consider the regulations with great care.<br><br>
There are four significant areas of change under the regulations. They alter some of the descriptors in the all work test, add definition to severe mental illness as an exempt category, redefine exceptional
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
circumstances, and clarify the fact that decisions about exemptions and exceptional circumstances are to be made by adjudication officers rather than BAMS.<br><br>
I have no difficulty on the last point, but should observe that the other changes carry us further than was implied by the Moule judgment, which I take to be one that the Minister has in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I draw attention to regulation 2(2) (b) which inserts a new definition of medical evidence—it has to be
<br><blockquote><p>"from a doctor approved by the Secretary of State"</p></blockquote>
and
<br><blockquote><p>"evidence … from any other doctor, or a hospital or similar institution,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>or such part of such evidence as constitutes the most reliable evidence available in the circumtances".</p></blockquote>
It would be helpful if the Minister explained the intention behind that change. In the consultation paper entitled "Improving Decision-Making and Appeals" the Government suggested that the objective should be to avoid setting one medical opinion against another. What is the purpose of the change? Is it to ensure that a BAMS doctor's judgment can be preferred to a GP's?<br><br>
Changes to some of the descriptors will make it harder for some people to score and therefore qualify for incapacity benefit. Some of the changes are no more than clarifications, but others have more serious implications.<br><br>
Two of the descriptors have been changed in ways that will make it more difficult for people to score on the mental disabilities scale. The first such change can be found in proposed new regulation 27(2)(11)(c), halfway down page 4 of the order, where the words "or television" are to be added after "radio". The full descriptor will therefore specify that a person cannot concentrate to read a magazine article or follow a radio or television programme.<br><br>
Surely it is easier to follow and comprehend a typical television programme—if there is such a thing—than a typical radio programme, given the accompanying visual stimulus? Will the Minister make it clear whether he envisages that people will be disqualified if they can follow a television programme; or will the test remain dependent on the capacity to make sense of a radio programme?<br><br>
That is a relatively minor matter, but the second descriptor change is more serious. That can be found at proposed new regulation 27(2)(11)(c)(ii), which is a tougher test of dangerous behaviour. The new descriptor will now require that
<br><blockquote><p>"agitation, confusion or forgetfulness has resulted in potentially dangerous accidents in the three months before".</p></blockquote>
Who decides what is potentially dangerous? How is it to be proved? What guidance will be given to Benefits Agency medical service doctors as to how to assess the matter?<br><br>
A third change will also make it harder for people to qualify for benefit. Item 13 relates to continence, and the regulations will mean that a person who is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0362">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
incontinent at night will not be able to score three points. This descriptor clearly carries a good deal of value in the system.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) noted, the exceptional circumstances in which people may qualify for benefit even though they fail to score 15 points under the all work test have been severely restricted. In the 1994 consultation document "The Medical Assessment for Incapacity Benefit", the Government noted that exceptional circumstances provisions were needed because it was recognised that a minority of conditions do not lend themselves to a functional test.<br><br>
In a memorandum to the Select Committee on Social Security, the Department stated that, although information on exceptional circumstances has not been collected as a matter of routine, a small sample of cases between October 1995 and April 1996 found that, in 13·7 per cent. of examined cases, the claimant scored fewer than 15 points but was nevertheless found incapable of work because of exceptional circumstances.<br><br>
The regulations substantially tighten the provisions by placing a more demanding test on life-threatening and uncontrollable diseases and by removing the provision under which people could be found incapable of work because they represented a risk to themselves or to other people. Comparing the existing regulations with the proposed substitutes requires a detailed textual exegesis, but hon. Members who care to undertake it will find that my description of the effect of the changes is accurate.<br><br>
I am worried that the success of the new provision will depend crucially on the quality of examinations and procedures. Evidence to the Select Committee on Social Security tells of the cursory examinations lasting in some cases only a 10th of the alloted time. As the hon. Member for Rochdale (Ms Lynne) has already pointed out, the success rate for appeals against negative findings in the all-work test is 47 per cent., which suggests that something is wrong with the current decision-making process.<br><br>
Under the Government's new proposals, a
<br><blockquote><p>"previously undiagnosed potentially life-threatening disease"</p></blockquote>
under the old regulations, has now to be
<br><blockquote><p>"discovered during the course of a medical examination carried out for the purpose of the all work test by a doctor approved by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
It is surprising if the Minister seriously means to rule out an earlier diagnosis as admissible evidence. I presume that a consultant's diagnosis would be more authoritative than the BAMS doctor's diagnosis. Will the Minister advise me if I have misunderstood the purport of his proposals? On the face of it, it seems dangerous and restrictive.<br><br>
The new provisions also take out the circumstances in which someone may be a substantial risk to others in a work environment; but it is important to keep that in. It is particularly important as a safeguard for people with mental health problems. Severe behavioural problems may be a threat to others. We should be concerned about that but, above all, we should be concerned for the well-being of the person
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
suffering from a severe mental condition. The system must surely find that such a person can be incapable of work and should receive benefit.<br><br>
There is the additional problem that the current all work test is not designed to take proper account of mental health conditions—a fact acknowledged by the Government and by other commentators. Hitherto uncontrollable diseases had to be sever condition but now they have to be a "severe life-threatening disease". That makes the threshold harder to cross. Some fairly severe restrictions are built into the new system, so the Minister should acknowledge that he is making the test much harder, especially for those with mental health problems.<br><br>
I wish to echo the question but by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central—why is the term "mental disease" substituted for "mental illness" in the new definition? What does that mean—that the condition should have an organic rather than social cause, if that is a meaningful distinction? At all events, the Minister should clarify what is intended and explain the significance of the term "disease". That question is even more important because the new definition is being written into the regulations rather than remaining in the handbook of advice for doctors as it was before, which gives the definition an added status.<br><br>
On Second Reading of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) Bill in 1994, the Secretary of State said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have no savings target"</p></blockquote>
and he went on suggest that, if savings turned out to be less than expected,
<br><blockquote><p>"we should certainly not change the severity of the test, which will have an objective rather than a financial basis."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 24 January 1994; Vol. 236, c. 44.]</p></blockquote>
I find it difficult to reconcile that statement with the promulgation of the present regulations, which clearly make the test more severe—without explanation and without any objective research evidence to justify them.</span></p>
<p>5.24 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have three questions that I should like to ask my hon. Friend, all of which relate to regulation 2(3)(c) which introduces a definition of "severe mental illness".<br><br>
First, like the hon. Members for Fife, Central and for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Howarth), I should like my hon. Friend to explain more fully to the Committee why it is necessary to insert a definition into legislation when no such definition previously was present. My hon. Friend will understand the concern on both sides of the Committee that the introduction of such a definition, while it could be said to be beneficial in that it provides a basis in law for the protection of individuals who might be able to benefit, could equally be said to be detrimental to the interests of potential beneficiaries because it replaces an element of discretion and judgment with a legal provision.<br><br>
Secondly, will my hon. Friend tell the Committee whether the definition of severe mental illness is sui generis to the regulations or is precedented elsewhere,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0363">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
either in the mental health legislation or the benefit legislation? The Committee would be reassured, as would I, to know that this is a familiar definition of severe mental illness and is well precedented in existing legislation. If, however, it is wholly sui generis here, the Committee is dealing with something more substantive and the wording takes on considerable significance.<br><br>
My third and final question concerns what appears to be one significant ambiguity in the wording of the definition. It is not clear whether the severe mental illness has to be continuous or whether it may be intermittent. That is obscure. It will be within the experience of every member of the Committee that there are some types of mental illness which have a severe manifestation on an intermittent basis. I hope that it is the Government's intention that such individuals should receive the necessary protection.<br><br>
On my reading of the definition, I am uncertain whether it covers individuals who, in a usual state, apparently are not suffering from a severe mental illness, but who might intermittently suffer from such an illness—for example, epileptics. There are many others with even more severe forms of mental disablement. I would feel more comfortable with the definition if that point had been made clear and if in the first line, after the word "which", the words "either continuously or intermittently" had been added. That would have avoided the ambiguity to which I have referred. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister responded to each of those three points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already sat down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Has the hon. Gentleman risen to make another speech?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir J. Stanley) has just made an important point about people who may suffer from intermittent severe mental ill health. Has the Minister considered what the implications should be in terms of amending the linking rules to cover people in that predicament?</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought when I looked at the list of members of the Committee that I was in for an interesting afternoon and that you, Sir David, and the Committee were in for an enlightening afternoon; and so it has proved. I am grateful that the expertise and experience of members of the Committee has been put to such good effect. I am happy to deal with the variety of questions that have been asked.<br><br>
When sending round a note to illustrate the regulations that are before a Committee, it is difficult not to go into so much detail that it would be unnecessary to come to the Committee. The points
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
that were raised show that the Committee process works to bring out questions and, I hope, to have them answered.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Fife, Central began with a few wide-ranging remarks about regulations. For the life of me I cannot see in the regulations any suggestion of a split between the deserving and non-deserving. I think that that went a bit wide, even for the hon. Gentleman. Regulations following an Act such as the one on which these are based are designed to provide the necessary fine-tuning to the Act without our having recourse to primary legislation, which is a good thing for reasons that will be clear to all members of the Committee. There is nothing sinister in the regulations and I hope that by the end of the sitting I will have been able to explain in more detail the theory behind some of the changes and to reassure colleagues as to the reason for them.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon wondered whether the regulations had come before us too soon. The Government are always caught between accusations of bringing measures in too soon or acting too late. I understand the evidence that the hon. Gentleman is waiting for—as are we—but he will appreciate that in the course of the constant monitoring of incapacity benefit, certain matters are thrown up. This was a convenient opportunity for us to do some fine-tuning based on information that has already come to us—there may be more in the future. We cannot hope to get it right without taking such opportunities. The hon. Gentleman will know that the regulations have been before the Social Security Advisory Committee and have therefore already been considered in considerable detail and approved by that body. It is not a question of their being hastily thrown to members of the Committee—they have already been thought through by us and by the Social Security Advisory Committee. Rightfully, they are now being given time by this Committee.<br><br>
With regard to the substantive matters that were raised, I should like to comment first on the recent changes to the recruitment of BAMS doctors, which was announced the other day. For the benefit of members of the Committee, BAMS is a convenient shorthand for the Benefits Agency Medical services. It is much easier to refer to the acronym than to spell it out each time.<br><br>
The changes will allow the Benefits Agency to trial new arrangements for the recruitment of full-time medical advisers to deal with claims for incapacity benefit. I can assure hon. Members, as I did earlier, that the changes will not lead to a fall in standards. Operational experience so far has shown that experience in particular areas of medicine is as important as general clinical experience for the assessment of capacity for work. The initiative is designed to provide the agency with an opportunity to test out the possibilities of operating some flexibility to ensure a continuing capability to recruit appropriate medical support.<br><br>
The trials are going to take place in Newcastle and in the Manchester and Merseyside area. They will involve the recruitment of up to 20 doctors. Applicants
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0364">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
will be required to have three years post-registration experience, including at least one year in general practice and at least six months' experience of psychiatry or rehabilitation or occupational health medicine, rather than the five years' general practice experience that is currently required. All doctors who are recruited in the trial will undergo the current rigorous training and approval process and receive additional monitoring as part of the evaluation of the trials. I hope that that explanation reassures hon. Members about our proposed change.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Lynne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on the BMA's announcement that it will recommend that doctors do not offer their services for BAMS?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter for the BMA. It has made similar noises in the past, but doctors must decide whether they want to be recruited and work for BAMs—and many do. We shall give the BMA every assurance about the changes and I am sorry that it has issued such a recommendation. I am confident that there is no diminution in the Benefits Agency medical services' proposed standards. I would prefer the BMA to consider our proposed changes more carefully and see how they work before it makes such recommendations.<br><br>
I want to deal now with some of the substantive points that hon. Members, including the hon. Lady, have made. I mentioned the number of appeals and their success or failure. The hon. Lady was afraid that there was a quota. If that were true, the number of appeals would presumably rise because doctors would arbitrarily knock out people who should otherwise qualify. The number of appeals and the ratio of success to failure would also be far greater than before. My point was, however, that there was no evidence for that. That is because there is no quota. I agree with the hon. Lady—and, I assume, with all members of the Committee—that we do not want large numbers of appeals and that it is better to get provisions right first time. That is what the regulations are about. The changes will make it easier for doctors to do their job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case though—with these and other regulations—that the same matters always come to the fore? I am not concerned about the number of appeals now vis-a-vis before, but about the number of front-line decisions that are simply wrong. The Minister must forgive me if the Department has already done this, but it must review changes to particular benefits and the way in which they are processed. It must take a substantive look at why so many decisions by it and its agencies are just plain wrong. Such mistakes mean, first, that many claimants must face an agonising appeals process. Recent regulations will, indeed, make oral hearings more difficult. Secondly, mistakes cost taxpayers money. The Government could argue that paying out on the front-line decisions increases costs, but appeals are expensive for the taxpayer. Thirdly—I apologise to the Minister for this long intervention—efficiency should be a matter of pride. We should not get so many
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
decisions wrong, irrespective of the size of the Department, the claims and the budget that is being spent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make two point in response to the hon. Gentleman's numerous concerns. Of course, I have no disagreement with him. We all want a system that produces the right answer the first time. There are, however, a couple of caveats.<br><br>
First, we acknowledge that we are dealing with something that is relatively imprecise. A medical opinion is being offered about someone's fitness to work. It has always been thus, whether one relies on the opinion of the individual or the GP who knows the individual, or whether one tries to find a more objective method. The purpose of incapacity benefit was to move away from a subjective appraisal to a more objective one. One of the reasons for that was that GPs made it plain that they found it awkward to be pressed by individuals for a decision on whether they were capable of work.<br><br>
Moving towards a more objective method is an attempt to do what the hon. Gentleman wants—to try to find a system that will more often produce the right answer at first instance. Inevitably, we must have a system in which someone who fails the test and is required to go back to work can appeal against that decision. Those who are knocked off benefit will often feel sufficiently aggrieved to challenge that decision. They may be right or they may be wrong, but we must inevitably give them an opportunity to challenge the decision.<br><br>
Whatever the absolute number of appeals over a period, we would look for the proportion of successful appeals to decrease because that would indicate that the test was correct at first instance. We are searching for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Lynne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that he is looking for the number of successful appeals to come down because that would imply that the regulations were a success. Might not the fact that new regulations that have just been passed allow only five working days to prepare an appeal also be an indicator? I urge the Minister not to take into account only one indicator when he makes his assessment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady makes a fair point. It takes us slightly wide of the draft regulations, but I understand her point.<br><br>
Appeals cost money and we have no wish to encourage more than are strictly necessary. We are trying to get the balance correct. However, this is inevitably an imprecise science and if there is to be the latitude that our constituents would desire for substitute opinions to be offered and considered by another panel, there will always be appeals.<br><br>
The hon. Lady asked whether consultants' letters were taken into account. They are. Before making a decision the adjudication officer can take into account other evidence including consultants' letters. In some cases, however, consultants' letters may be time-lapsed. They may have been issued some time earlier
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0365">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
and the examining doctors may have a more up-to-date picture of the individual in front of them. All evidence can be and is taken into account by the adjudication officer. When constituents say that evidence has not been taken into account, they mean that it has not been taken into account as they would wish.<br><br>
We are all agreed that we want the number of appeals to decrease if possible and the number of successes at first instance to rise, but there is no quota. If there were, one would expect the number of successes on appeal to be much higher than it is. I would be grateful if the hon. Lady did not make that suggestion again because it just ain't true.<br><br>
I shall deal now with one or two other matters raised by hon. Members. First, the descriptors were mentioned by the hon. Members for Fife, Central and for Stratford-on-Avon and my right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling. Most of the descriptors that we are trying to get right arise from our assessment of the first year in which the test has been working. A number of points need tightening up and the Committee will understand why if I explain the rationale behind a couple of them.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Fife, Central mentioned sitting in an upright chair and wondered what on earth could go wrong with that. The activity is intended to measure the extent to which a person can sit comfortably before having to move from a chair, by which it is intended to establish the level of discomfort that makes it impossible to continue sitting. The amendment is intended to clarify the position.<br><br>
There is evidence of considerable variation in the way doctors and adjudicating authorities interpret "sit comfortably". The amendment would set out more precisely the policy intention that the degree of discomfort should be such as to make sitting impossible.<br><br>
What of the activity of bending and kneeling? The Government did not themselves sit in a room and work out the descriptors. They are based on the work of a panel of 80 medical experts. It is right for the descriptors to be changed if necessary, but they are not political creations.<br><br>
The activity of bending and kneeling is intended to assess a person's ablity to touch the knees and straighten, and the ability to manoeuver in order to pick up something light from the floor and to straighten up again. It should not matter whether the manoeuvers are achieved by bending or kneeling or by some combination of the two. In the application of the test, there have been inconsistencies in how the descriptors are applied. The proposal would amend the wording of two of the descriptors to make the intention clearer and to ensure uniform application of the test.<br><br>
With respect to current misapplication, adjudication authorities have been assessing the ability to bend or kneel rather than the ability to manoeuvre as if to pick up a piece of paper from the floor, which was the original intention. That explains why we have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
gone into some detail with the descriptors—it is nothing sinister. If we are applying a test with certain rules, it is obvious that everyone should be working at the same one.<br><br>
Some particular problems were raised about descriptors so I shall deal with them now. The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon mentioned continence. The activity is intended to identify the presence of bowel or urinary incontinence which might interfere with a person's ability to work. It is not intended to include enuresis—bedwetting—which occurs only during sleep. The amendment would make that clear. It is not included because bedwetting that occurs during sleep would not affect ability to work during waking hours. Underlying causes for the condition can be and are identified elsewhere in the test. The policy intention is not to tighten up the test but to award a descriptor where incontinence would lead to a person being prevented from working at all or having to leave the work place.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon also raised the descriptor dealing with radio and television. That particular activity is dealt with under regulation 2(11) (c) (i) and it assesses the ability of a person with a mental health problem to complete everyday tasks, including the ability to concentrate. The amendment would more accurately reflect everyday life by including a reference to the ability to follow a television programme. Current wording refers only to a radio programme.<br><br>
Once again, the test is not tightened. It will test the ability to follow a radio or a TV programme—many people do not listen to radio programmes. Watching television also requires the application of attention or concentration and it is more realistic to refer to television programmes. I stress again that nothing sinister is intended.<br><br>
Particular concerns were raised about mental health provisions. They are similar to the "exceptional" changes to regulation 27 and they have the same basis. The Moule judgment was important because the power to decide about the application of the test was moved from the doctor to the adjudication officer. It has necessitated putting further definitions in the regulations. The people who were covered by the test when it was applied by the doctor—it will now be decided upon by the adjudication officer—will still be covered. The sole reason for the change is to clarify the test, to enable the adjudication officer to make the decision. I shall make the point clearer in relation to mental illness.<br><br>
First, there is nothing sinister in the specification of a mental disease. That merely reflects the fact that the legislation requires that benefit can be paid only as a consequence of a specific disease or bodily or mental disablement. That is the reason for the term "mental disease". My right hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling also asked whether it is <i>sui generis.</i> It is indeed; the definition is specific to the regulations.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend also asked whether it will be acknowledged that mental illness can fluctuate. Yes—a number of other conditions, such as myalgic
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0366">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
encephalomyelitis and other conditions which vary from day to day are covered by the all work test. The test is not a snapshot and acknowledges that people who come before the doctor for it will have good days and bad. That certainly applies to mental illness and there is no intention to change that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister then tell us whether the question of the words "intermittent" and "continuous" will be dealt with? Hon. Members have made the point that that discretion might not be provided for. Where is it provided for, either in these or other regulations, to cover the question of intermittent illness?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the nature of the intermittent illness makes someone incapable of work when he is going through such spells, I believe that the test will apply to that. There must be a clinical decision by the doctor and a decision by the adjudication officer that takes into account the type of intermittent illness. It is not the illness that decides whether someone is incapable under the test, but its impact on the individual's day-to-day circumstances. The decision is clinical. There is nothing in the regulations that would make that impossible for the doctors to take into account. The straight answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is: yes, an intermittent illness is covered in the all work test regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Stanley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am reassured by my hon. Friend's explanation, but the legislation goes on to the statute book, not his words, though they may be taken into account if an issue goes to court.<br><br>
I still have concerns about the wording, not least because there is, first, no reference to the word "intermittent"; and secondly, the definition is couched entirely in the present tense. The second line of regulation 2(3)(c) includes the word "affects" and the third lines includes the word "restricts". There is thus no suggestion that a past occurrence of the impediment should be taken into account. The use of the words "had affected or affects" or "had restricted" or "restricts" or "in the future restricts" or "might in the future restrict" or "might in the future affect" would conform much more with his explanation. Couching the definition in the present tense suggests that there is a bias towards illnesses that are present and apparent continuously, which is at odds with my hon. Friend's explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Committee proceeds, I should say that I have allowed two rather long interventions. I shall not allow any more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, perhaps I can help my right hon. Friend. The definition has been drawn up after close consultation with the lobby and with the Royal College of Psychiatrists. It has been put together not by politicians but by the same experts who helped us to draft the test in the first place.<br><br>
A previous mental condition is taken into account by the doctor applying the test, but it is crucial—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the Minister address the Chair, please? As well as being a normal courtesy, it helps the <i>Hansard</i> writers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Sir David.<br><br>
The test certainly recognises past mental illness, but it is crucial to its nature that it assesses a person's ability to work here and now. So at the heart of the test is the impact on a person's ability to work now of a continuing condition or of one in the past. That applies both to physical and mental conditions.<br><br>
Heart disease was mentioned earlier. There will not be enough time to discuss it in detail, but that disease is one of those conditions for which the treatment varies. A person's ability to go back to work after a heart attack is infinitely variable. Some people go back to work very soon afterwards, others never do. The fact that a heart attack features in a person's history is not an automatic bar to that person's ability to go back to work in the future, but it is taken into account.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wealden)</span></span> <span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I am to complete my remarks about regulation 27, I have to do it in the four minutes remaining. I hope that hon. Members can be very brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that my hon. Friend the Minister's description of mental disease truly reflects what is in the legislation. Mental illness need not involve mental disease.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point of specifying mental disease was not to exclude mental illness, but the legislation provides that benefit can be paid only as a consequence of a specific disease or bodily or mental disablement. That is why the term is used: it is an enabling term, not a restricting term. It was put together with the assistance of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.<br><br>
Regulation 27 is important. The Committee will be aware that the term "substantial risk" has been moved from the criteria in regulation 27. We are redefining the provisions more precisely in the light of the court's decision, but it is not our intention that anyone who came under the original scope of regulation 27 should now be excluded.<br><br>
In the case of a physical disease, the substantial risk criteria apply to people with a life-threatening, uncontrolled or uncontrollable disease. As a further safeguard in mental health cases, the new definition of severe mental illness for the purpose of the exempt categories means that doctors will need also to consider carefully whether the criteria for exemption are met.<br><br>
The possibility of exemption will need to be considered again during the all work test examination. In particular, the doctor will consider whether a person's mood or behaviour is so adversely affected that the ability to function socially is severely restricted, or whether he is very likely to pose a real threat or danger to others, such as work colleagues or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0367">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
members of the public. In such cases, the doctor would consider advising that the client meets the criteria for exemption on the grounds of severe mental illness.<br><br>
The purpose of the change to the regulations, therefore, is not to restrict but to ensure that what was previously covered as an instruction to which doctors worked is now available to assist the adjudication officer. We intend that exactly the same people who would have been covered by the term "substantial risk" will still be covered. The criteria for exceptional circumstances have been expanded, so that the term "severe life-threatening disease" now covers an entirely new category which was absent from the instruction to which the doctors worked. It is intended that those who would have been covered by the term "substantial risk" are still covered by the terms of the new regulation.<br><br>
Sir David, we are near the end of the debate, and I have covered all the matters that were raised—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should point out that there is injury time because of the Division in the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case I am a little more relaxed. I was originally sent a note which said that the Committee was to finish at six o'clock. Is that not the case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret to inform the hon. Gentleman that he has until eleven minutes past six.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is rather better, because it will enable us to clear this up.<br><br>
I was making the point that the change in regulation 27 allows for the condition that was previously covered by substantial risk to be included. The life-threatening condition that the doctor is able to detect would previously have been noted under the substantial risk criterion.<br><br>
The extra time gives me an opportunity to deal with heart conditions. I recognise hon. Members' concerns about the operation of the all work test where a complainant has a heart disorder. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that many people who have a heart attack make a good recovery. It would therefore be wrong automatically to treat them as incapable of work. I hope that that is not seriously disputed.<br><br>
The goal of modern medical management is to rehabilitate patients and get them back to work, even if they cannot return to their previous job. We recognise that some people might have a continuing problem following a heart attack, despite optimal medical treatment—for example, they might suffer persistent chest pains, breathlessness or fatigue. Those problems are fully addressed by BAMs doctors, who carry out all work test examinations. Sadly, many people still die suddenly and unexpectedly from heart disease. That happens to people with no previous medical history of it, as well as those who have had a previous heart attack. No test exists which can reliably predict when a person who has had a heart attack is likely to die, and no doctor can reliably predict such an event.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
The implications are not confined to social security matters. For example, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency recognises that there is a risk of sudden death at the wheel. It is thought that 75 per cent. of all deaths while driving are due to ischaemic heart disease. It is recognised that it would be wrong to bar people from driving just because they have a heart condition, as there is no way of predicting when or whether problems might occur. Driving may resume within one month of a heart attack, providing there are no complications and if exercise testing of the person is satisfactory. That example sufficiently illustrates the many difficulties that the issue presents.<br><br>
The all work test allows full consideration to be given to people with heart conditions. People with heart disease are assessed both on their ability to perform the functional activities in the test and on the risk posed by their condition if it is uncontrolled or uncontrollable. The functional assessment that is performed by a BAMS doctor takes full account of the effect of fatigue and breathlessness—possible symptons of heart disease—on the person's ability to perform the prescribed activities. Issues relating to medical risk are covered by the exceptional circumstances that must be considered by the BAMS doctor in every case.<br><br>
I assure hon. Members that all reasonable steps are taken as part of the all work test to identify people with continuing severe symptons who are clearly not medically fit for any type of work. Any causal link between an adjudication officer's decision to disallow incapacity benefit and any customer's tragic death must remaim entirely speculative.<br><br>
A return to work after a heart attack is considered to be the major objective of rehabilitation in people of working age. Patients and their families are often anxious, but the likelihood of a substantial risk being brought about by work as opposed to other factors is usually small. In particular, where an exercise test is normal and there are no other complicating medical factors, the risk to a person's health of a return to work is very small. When providing an opinion on regulation 27 in such cases, the doctor will consider all the various factors that might be relevant to risk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if the Minister would comment on the point that I made earlier when I suggested that the new wording seems to preclude consideration of a diagnosis that was previously made by the claimant's own doctor or by a consultant who might have reported on his case. The wording now insists that the diagnosis must be discovered
<br><blockquote><p>"during the course of a medical examination carried out for the purposes of the all work test by a doctor approved by the Secretary of State"—</p></blockquote>
presumably the BAMS doctor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The adjudication officer—I reassure the Committee—is entitled to take into account all evidence presented of the individual's condition, including that presented by the examining doctor. He may also take account of other evidence, such as that of consultants and GPs—the GP's opinion is certainly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V004P0I0368">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
a standard part of the test. There is no suggestion that a consultant's opinion on the state of a claimant's health would be barred.<br><br>
We have covered a wide range of topics—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is kind and I am trying the Committee's tolerance, but these matters are important to our constituents. The right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling mentioned discontinuous conditions. Could a claimant with such an intermittent disability who returns to work but must then stop working because the condition recurs go back on to incapacity benefit at the level at which he had previously claimed? Will he have to go through the rigmarole of the all work test again? Will the adjudication officer be satisfied that the claimant has a chronic, recurrent condition and should go back on to benefit on the previous terms?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Within the limit—it is eight weeks, I think—of the linking rules provision for incapacity benefit, it would be possible for him to go straight back on to benefit. Outside that, a person would usually have to claim afresh. Clearly, the circumstances of the claim and the nature of the illness may mean that someone would be better placed to satisfy the all work test. If someone is fit to go back to work, but his illness is such that it recurs and makes him incapable of work, the benefit could be allowed.<br><br>
We have covered a range of topics. I hope that I can tell my right hon. Friends, the Members for Wealden (Sir G. Johnson Smith) and for Tonbridge and Mailing that we have made progress on mental illness. We included it in the regulations because we were moving from a situation in which the doctor could make a decision that bound the adjudication officer. The High Court has told us that we could not do that. Because the term must now be interpreted by the adjudication officer and, possibly, an appeal tribunal, it must have a greater emphasis in the regulations. We have sought medical advice to get the definition right and doctors' advice has given rise to the present definition. There is nothing sinister about the term "disease", which creates an opening, and is not restrictive.<br><br>
I hope that I have covered the intermittent nature of an illness. The all work test can look for it and take it into account in physical and mental conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How will the definition of severe mental illness cover substantial risk when there is no legislative basis for that in the redrawn regulation 27?
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
What guidance will be issued to adjudication officers and the Benefits Agency medical service? The Social Security Select Committee was told that health exemptions had been missed. Will the Minister assure us that such cases will be picked up in the future?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: None of us would wish severe cases to be missed at first instance in any circumstance. I could, however, fully satisfy the hon. Gentleman only if I could assure the Committee that no doctor would ever make a mistake, no two doctors' opinions would differ and that everything that is now picked up at appeal or at second intance would always be picked up at first instance. I cannot give that assurance. I can say only that it is in the interest of all of us to ensure that the guidance for the test is as complete as possible, that the monitoring of doctors who carry it out is as rigorous as possible and that the definitions provided by medical opinion are as clear as possible and allow adjudication officers to make their decisions. The Government have sought to do that. I hope that our detailed discussion of the regulations has done the Committee a service by clarifying how the Government will continue to deal with the all work test and its consequences.</span></p>
