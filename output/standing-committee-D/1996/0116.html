	<div class='clause'>New Clause 22</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>SEN CODE OF PRACTICE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"A careers adviser shall, in making available careers education to a registered pupil who has special educational needs, have regard to any Code of Practice issued under section 313 of the Education Act 1996".—[	<i>Mr. Win Griffiths</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move the new clause in the ardent hope that the Government will accept that it adopts a reasonable and responsible approach to how careers advisers should view the code of practice for the identification and assessment of special educational needs. Under the Education Act 1996, everyone involved in education must pay attention to the code of practice and everyone is told, in the time-honoured phrase, "to have regard to it". However, such a provision does not cover careers advisers, something which this Bill laudably seeks to deal with—at least, to some extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft leaflet on access that was published by the Department for Education and Employment mentions in its last paragraph the code of practice. The document is a draft leaflet, which is why I am sure that the Government will be prepared to differ slightly from the view that they have taken so far. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schools and Careers Services should refer to the Code of Practice on Identification and Assessment of Special Educational Needs issued by the DfE in 1993."</p></blockquote>
I do not believe that I am being over-pedantic, but to be asked to refer to the code of practice is not the same as to be asked to have regard to it. Nor is being asked to have regard to the code of practice the same as being referred to a guidance leaflet that suggests that careers advisers should refer to the code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also consider the amount of specialist training that will be required either for all careers advisers or for a group of advisers to whom anyone can have access in a particular area. Special expertise is needed to enable careers guidance advisers to give appropriate advice to pupils with special educational needs on their prospects. I hope that the Minister will say whether the Government anticipated additional financial implications in ensuring that those involved in careers guidance are properly equipped to provide such a service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of all, I hope that the Government will accept the new clause or, at least, be prepared to consider it and return at a later stage with a similar proposal to
	<span class='label label-info column'>618</span>
ensure that the careers service has regard to the code of practice and is not told in a guidance leaflet simply to refer to it when giving advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Department's code of practice on the identification and assessment of special educational needs is an important source of advice that every school is already required, under law, to take into account when they take action on behalf of children with special educational needs. The current code includes sections on preparing pupils for transition at the age of 16 and provides advice on how careers services should assist with that preparation. Obviously, it is our intention that that advice be followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides that careers education should become part of the overall educational responsibility of head teachers and governors, so the statutory duty to ensure the code takes account of that is already in place. Although careers advisers may contribute to careers education, it is for each school to determine a careers education policy that suits its particular circumstances and to decide how it can best be implemented. I believe that the schools themselves are best placed to ensure that the code is taken into account in the planning and provision of all careers education within their institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for the schools to ensure also that any input from the careers adviser takes account of the code. We therefore share the view that careers advisers should take account of the code. The Department will provide a reminder of that in its good practice guide and in advice on implementing the legislation, so the legal duty to ensure that that happens is already sufficiently in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite apart from that, LEAs are required by law to invite a member of the careers service to the first annual review of a child's statement following his or her 14th birthday. A separate section in the code of practice, entitled "The Role of the Careers Service", clearly describes the sort of information and advice that members of the careers service are expected to provide in such circumstances. As the appropriate legal duty to take account of the code in careers education provision therefore already exists—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way. I hope that we can complete the debate quickly. Why does the draft access leaflet contain the words "refer to", and not say that the careers advisers should "have regard to"? There is a slight nuance—a slight difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not yet received advice to the contrary on that matter, so I shall work on the assumption that there is no material difference; I shall let the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) know if I receive such advice. I do not believe that the distinction suggested by the hon. Gentleman exists. If it did, I should indeed want to consider the matter again, to see if there was any weakness or lack of effectiveness in the wording. On that matter, the hon. Gentleman and I—and, indeed all members of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>619</span>
Committee—share the desire to ensure that the intention and thrust of the code on special educational needs is maintained across the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing provisions—the Education Act 1996 and the code—and the Bill will ensure that our shared objectives are fulfilled. If they do not, I should want to remedy the situation. Subject to further advice on whether the distinction between the wording mentioned by the hon. Gentleman is significant, I am satisfied—I hope that the Committee, too, is satisfied—that the existing provisions are adequate and that new clause 22 is otiose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for what I think is a helpful response. I look forward to the possibility of further advice on the semantics—the difference between "refer to" and "have regard to". From what the Minister said, I am satisfied that the careers guidance service will have to operate under the code of practice, because the ultimate duty of the school will be to the pupil. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES FOR PUPIL REFERRAL UNITS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move the amendment No. 124, in page 47, line 4, at beginning insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'At the beginning of Schedule 1 to the Education Act 1996 (Pupil referral units) there shall be inserted:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"() A pupil referral unit shall have as its principal objective the satisfactory reintegration into school after a limited period of pupils referred to it.".'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to clarify the law. Again, I shall be happy if the Minister wishes to speak about existing provisions. The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear that the principal objective of pupil referral units is to ensure
	<br><blockquote><p>"the satisfactory reintegration into school after a limited period of pupils referred to it."</p></blockquote>
Some provision for that already exists in DFEE guidance note 11/94.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice though, as reflected by the Ofsted report, pupil referral units can almost become detached from the rest of the educational system. People find it all too easy to refer difficult pupils to them and then forget them. The teachers who staff those units have the difficult job of dealing with those pupils and trying to offer them a hope of returning to mainstream education, overcoming the disregard in which they are held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
LEA schools and Government advice work towards the early return of pupils to mainstream schools. Good practice and the advice already provided try to ensure that that happens. I do not think that the Government can ever argue that that fundamental objective should be contained only in a circular because it may change over time, as can be argued for many other matters.
	<span class='label label-info column'>620</span>
The fundamental objective of trying to reintegrate disruptive and difficult pupils into schools does not change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
DFEE circular 11/94, "The education by LEAs of children otherwise than at school", states at paragraph 4:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The prime aim in respect of all children who are away from school should be to secure their return to mainstream education, including special schools, as soon as practicable."</p></blockquote>
At paragraph 21, it adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where children are out of school the aim wherever possible should be to plan for their return to mainstream schooling, in the meantime keeping their education in touch with that of their peers in schools."</p></blockquote>
We believe that that good advice would be better as a statutory objective in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circular gives further specific advice on the date at which a pupil's progress should be reviewed. We should not expect that on the face of the Bill because there may be arguments about the frequency of reviews—every term or half term, six-monthly, annually or whatever. Perhaps at least each half term might be appropriate, but that kind of advice can be contained in circulars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a specific duty for pupil referral units, or other means of dealing with disruptive pupils—such as Cities in Schools in south Wales, which I have seen to be excellent—rather than a reliance on advice in guidance circulars. I cannot envisage any future change in the worthwhile objective of a return to mainstream education. It should, therefore, be a statutory obligation on the face of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two or three different strands to the argument deployed by the hon. Member for Bridgend. One is the adequacy of wording in a circular as opposed to words on the face of a Bill. He mentioned the argument, which he knows I often use, about the need for flexibility in the future and suggested that we are dealing with some kind of absolute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the terms used in the circular are, if anything, even stronger than those that the hon. Gentleman suggests. I shall quote paragraph 10 of the circular—I do not think that he did so—which says much the same thing. It states that we should
	<br><blockquote><p>"secure the early return to mainstream schooling … It must be stressed that education otherwise"—</p></blockquote>
that is, pupil referral units—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is exceptional provision: it is always to be regarded as a short-term alternative to mainstream education."</p></blockquote>
So there can be no doubt about the basic thrust of policy on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the potential risk of isolation of pupil referral units from mainstream education, but one of the objectives of having proper management committees for those units—one of the subjects of the Bill—is that they will contain representatives of local schools. We believe that they will try to deal with the problem—I acknowledge that it has sometimes arisen—that pupil referral units do their own thing, so there is a risk that they become
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0441">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>621</span>
isolated from the schools with which they are supposedly to work closely. Therefore, the Bill already contains a real attempt to deal with one of the problems that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real difficulty that I have with the rather absolute nature of the amendment and with the argument that the hon. Gentleman deploys, which in itself is absolutely laudable, arises from the types of pupil referred to such units—for example, persistent non-attenders, those who suffer from neurotic disorders including social phobia, those who are pregnant or young mothers who are therefore unable to attend ordinary school. Some pupil referral units include all those groups; others tend to specialise in some of them. Frankly, it is not realistic—it might not even be desirable—to place an absolute obligation on pupil referral units so that, in every case, they make it their priority to return all those types of young people to mainstream education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I slightly overstated my case. The amendment states that reintegration should be the "principal objective"—it is not absolute—so there would be flexibility to take account of what the Minister says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I accept that. That is in the amendment's wording, and perhaps it might provide a bridge between us. However, the wording of the circular already goes that far—some might argue that it goes further. I am not conviced that there is a need to include in the Bill a form of words that states that reintegration is the principal objective but allows other possibilities—as the hon. Gentleman has kindly conceded—such as those that I have suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the combination of the guidelines in the circular and the need for flexibility suggest that it is unnecessary to alter the wording of the Bill, even in the way that the hon. Gentleman has suggested. However, if it were to be demonstrated in the future that pupil referral units were failing to give priority to the return of pupils to mainstream education whenever possible, desirable and beneficial—we all agree that they should do that—we might want to reconsider such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the inspection of pupil referral units is a vehicle by which we are likely to know much more than we have done about the vital role that pupil referral units play. That is why we want them to be managed effectively, why we want there to be links between them and mainstream schools and why we are now having them inspected. So, in future, we shall know much more about them than we do now. The amendment is unnecessary because of its form of words and because of what is already stated in the circular; for that reason, I cannot support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I am a little disappointed by the Minister's reply, although I take in good faith all that he said about the Government's intentions and what is contained in the circular. I still feel that it would be better to accept the amendment, but there is
	<span class='label label-info column'>622</span>
not a sufficient ideological split on the issue for us to vote on it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 250, in page 47, line 28, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'and for requiring such a committee to include staff representatives from pupil referral units within the authority concerned.'.</p></blockquote>
I suspect that the Government will accept the spirit of the amendment, although they may not accept its wording. It would make the relationship between pupil referral units and schools a little clearer. The clause enables the establishment of management committees for pupil referral units, and in providing regulatory powers for the Secretary of State refers to some of the criteria for their composition. It refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"persons representing schools (including grant-maintained schools) situated in the area from which the unit or units in question may be expected to draw pupils".</p></blockquote>
However—the Minister may be able to disabuse me on this point—I cannot see any provision in the clause that will give staff of pupil referral units the automatic right of representation on the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to the danger of pupil referral units becoming semi-detached from mainstream schooling—a danger mentioned in reports of the Office for Standards in Education. In order to prevent that danger, it is vital to provide in the regulatory framework for the committees that, just as schools in an area should be represented by staff, at least one member of the pupil referral unit's staff should be on the management committee. I hope that if the Minister cannot accept the amendment he will explain how he will ensure that its objective—to ensure that pupil referral unit staff are represented on management committees—will be achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty that I have with the amendment is essentially practical. I have no doubt that by and large, staff will be represented on the committees, and the clause makes adequate provision for that. We will consult widely on how management committees should be set up and who should be represented on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One problem is that, as the Committee will know, many pupil referral units are very small. I have visited some that have only two or three members of staff—extraordinarily dedicated and committed staff, who do some of the most valuable work in education. It is possible to conceive of circumstances in which staff of a pupil unit might decline to serve on a management committee—for practical, personal reasons, reasons of conscience or whatever. If we include an absolute requirement in the Bill, there is a risk, however small, that we may put a pupil referral unit in breach of the law if it fails to provide a member of staff willing to serve on the committee. That is one of the reasons why I am always uneasy about clear-cut, absolute requirements being included in a Bill, especially given that huge variety of circumstances that inevitably arise, particularly in regard to pupil referral units. It is bad enough trying to imagine the variety in school staff sizes, from a tiny primary school to the biggest
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>623</span>
comprehensives; the variation in pupil referral units is even greater and small size even more of a consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. To help to short-circuit the debate, I ask the Minister to make it clear in any guidance he issues that the Government hope that pupil referral units will be represented on the committee if possible; I leave the wording of that to him and his civil servants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The shyness and coyness that I display in the early stages of a Committee are rapidly disappearing as I gain a little confidence. Although I was reluctant earlier to pre-empt consultation by giving the sort of commitments suggested by the hon. Gentleman, I now feel bold enough to say that I would have thought it unlikely if, after consultation, our guidance did not include a reference along the lines of "we would expect", "it would be normal" or "only in exceptional circumstances would it not be the case" that staff would be properly and appropriately represented on the management committee. That must be in everyone's interests. However, I want to leave a degree of flexibility in the Bill to enable us to encompass the huge variation of circumstances that we are likely to find and to avoid getting ourselves or pupil referral units into needless difficulty. Again, we agree on the matter and I am sure that we can resolve it, following proper consultation, in the guidance. I hope that on that basis, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the inclusion of clause 64 in the Bill. As some hon. Members will know, I tabled a ten-minute Bill on the regulation of supply teacher agencies and I am delighted that the Government have taken note of that, despite the fact that some Conservative Members—not the Minister but several Back Benchers—voted against that Bill on Second Reading. I am glad that the Government have recognised the sensible nature of our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are new aspects to the issue and it therefore needed to be addressed afresh. It is new for three reasons. First, most LEAs no longer run their own supply teacher pool; secondly, local management of schools has given schools greater freedom to spend their own budgets and choose their own supply teachers directly; thirdly, and importantly, the Government's deregulation policy has had an impact. It is that last factor that the amendment and the new clause address. Deregulation means that absolutely anyone can set up a supply teacher agency. You, Sir Michael, I, or anyone could sit in a car with a mobile phone and call ourselves a supply teacher agency. Little would happen unless someone chose to complain. I do not believe that that is good enough or that the issue has been addressed in the clause.

The Government have said that no supply teachers should be in classrooms if they have not had police or health checks, which is fine. They say, too, that teachers should have the necessary qualifications, which is also fine. But the problem is how to ensure that that happens. In the real world, the head teacher arrives at the school at half-past 7 in the morning, receives a phone call from someone saying he is ill and quickly has to recruit a supply teacher from an agency. In a survey that I did, I found that three out of four schools used private supply teacher agencies in London. Therefore, the headmaster has to ring one of the agencies which, if it is efficient, will send along a supply teacher for 9 o'clock. In those circumstances, there is no way that the head teacher can take responsibility for ensuring that the supply teacher has been checked properly and has the necessary qualifications which are laid down in the clause. A more practical and effective way of double-checking and ensuring that a supply teacher has been properly checked is to ensure that the agency is regulated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Lady may be aware that one of the leading supply agencies is situated in Finchley central. It indulges in the most rigorous checks. It seeks references, including those from the university from which the supply teacher obtained his or her degree and it makes the most rigorous checks with the police. If I may say so, if the hon. Lady had made similar checks when she was in charge of Islington council, the social work department there might not have become a refuge for paedophiles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

early stage to encourage me to introduce my ten-minute Bill. The agency is called TimePlan and it has been promoting my proposals with officials of the Department for Education and Employment for a long time. It may surprise the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the practical point of ensuring that checks have been properly carried out. I can tell the hon. Member for Hendon, South that it was my experience in Islington that led me to want to ensure that proper checks are in place to cover the sensitive issue of supply teachers working with our children. That informed my attitude to my ten-minute Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said that anyone can set up an agency. When I was doing research for my Bill, I came across some extraordinary people who were setting up agencies, some of whom became very cross with me for raising the issue. I found it very surprising that one agency had been in the business of providing crane drivers, but had moved from that to providing supply teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lifting standards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lifting standards!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency assured me that the quality and rigour with which it recruited supply teachers was second to none. I asked it to let me have a look at its books, but it has not yet let me do so. I still find it surprising that it is possible to move in an unregulated manner from dealing with crane drivers to dealing with teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another agency moved from dealing with construction workers and drivers to dealing with teachers, and another agency moved from dealing with care workers to dealing with teachers. Those are odd combinations, and similar cases would not occur, for example, with nursing. Nurses have to be registered under the Nurses Agency Act 1957 to ensure that those who recruit nurses to work as agency staff in hospitals are properly vetted. Teachers should be treated in the same way—there should be proper vetting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>626</span>
The most horrific story about agencies that I have come across occured in Manchester, where the Select Appointments temping agency set up a division to deal with supply teachers and sent its director into schools to drum up business. The head teacher of one of those schools recognised the director as someone whose name was on the Department's list 99. That is the most extreme example of what can go wrong if agencies are not regulated, but it demonstrates the subject's importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To realise the Government's intention in the clause, agencies should be regulated. I accept that the cost of doing so should not fall on the public purse. The good agencies with which I have had contact and discussions—including the TimePlan Education Group—have said that they are willing to meet the cost of regulation, and I have proposed the new clause with that offer in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be interested to hear the Minister's views on another issue that still needs to be discussed—although I accept that it is not a direct part of the clause—namely, the tax fiddle that is open to supply teachers who come into this country and work here. Basically, they come to this country and pick up a copy of 	<i>TNT Magazine,</i> which advises them to go to several agencies in London. Those agencies suggest that they should establish a limited company, which would allow them to work in schools as supply teachers who have the status of a limited company. That enables them to avoid going on to the PAYE list, which means that they can pay their own insurance and their tax is calculated at a later date. Of course, by the time that the tax authorities catch up with them, most of the teachers have swanned their way around the rest of Europe or have gone back to, for example, Australia. Such tax fiddling is unacceptable. What steps are being taken to deal with the problem? It is also unclear whether those teachers have proper insurance cover when they work at schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I broadly welcome the proposed legislation and I really am delighted that the clause has been included in the Bill. However, the Minister should reconsider the question of the registration of agencies, and I look forward to hearing her views on tax avoidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mrs. Cheryl Gillan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the congratulations of the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) on the clause. There is broad agreement about it, and it reflects our commitment to protecting children in schools. We believe that it will ensure that there are no loopholes in the legislation that prevents unsuitable people from having access to children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Lady will forgive me—I have rather a long speaking note on this matter. I hope that it will cover many of the matters that she raised, and I believe that it will be useful to put it on the record at this stage. I should begin, however, with the last point that she raised, which was about foreign teachers who come here and the related matter of taxation. I will look into that and write to her as soon as possible with a reply to the points that she raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>627</span>
There are two issues here: the power of the Secretary of State to impose specific regulations on teacher employment agencies, and the licensing of such agencies. On the first point, I am pleased to reassure the hon. Lady that the clause gives the Secretary of State the necessary powers. The hon. Lady wishes to allow the Secretary of State to impose regulations on teacher employment agencies or businesses, as well as on local authorities and schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations already bite on agency supply teachers employed under a contract of employment. Subsection (4) of clause 64, by widening the definition of "employed", means that the regulation-making power will extend to those not employed under a contract of employment. This will allow the teachers regulations to be amended so as to apply to all teachers working at a school, including those supplied by agencies who do not have contracts of employment. The details of the regulations would be subject to wide consultation and I hope that the hon. Member for Barking will contribute to that consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would empower the Secretary of State to impose regulations, which would be binding on all parties involved. The hon. Lady's amendment is therefore unnecessay, and I hope she will agree to withdraw it. If not, I urge the Committee to reject it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the wider question of licensing, we of course share the hon. Lady's wish to ensure that all agencies and businesses involved in the supply of teachers behave responsibly. We simply do not believe that licensing is the best way to tackle this. We believe that the controls now in place will secure what the hon. Lady would wish. A licensing system does not guarantee future good conduct. When licensing was in operation, there were breaches of the legislation by licensed agencies. What is important is that there are mechanisms in place to deal with any breaches as soon as they are uncovered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that there should be effective powers against those who are unsuitable to run agencies. That is precisely what the power of prohibition in section 3A of the Employment Agencies Act 1973 provides. Powers of inspection, not just in respect of teaching agencies, already exist under section 9(1) of that Act and I undertake to send the hon. Lady a copy so that she can examine those provisions. Powers to regulate conduct are also provided in section 5(1).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is right that powers of inspection already exist, although I assume that they have not been used to date, is it the Minister's intention that the Department should undertake such inspections?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Lady will let me continue because I shall cover that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act states that agencies must comply with any statutory requirements and clause 64, as we have discussed, would allow us to impose new requirements in respect of teachers who are not employed under a contract of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>628</span>
Inspectors from the Department of Trade and Industry employment agencies standards team conduct spot checks on agencies and follow up complaints made about agencies. Agencies may be prosecuted, and industrial tribunals may make prohibition orders against persons or agencies in cases of misconduct or for any other sufficient reason, so people may be prohibited from running agencies. The failure of an agency to conduct necessary checks on teachers could constitute such misconduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from misconduct, sufficient reason for prohibition could include the involvement of unsuitable persons in the agency itself. If the head of a teacher employment agency were himself a barred teacher on list 99, this could constitute sufficient reason for seeking a prohibition order. If the agency employed barred teachers to act as interviewers or to make decisions about which teacher went to which school, that too could be sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a report last year, the hon. Lady mentioned certain cases which concerned her. She has cited a number of such cases today. It seems that at least some of those cases occurred when a system of licensing was still in operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Barking has current grounds for complaint against any specific agency, she should refer the matter to my hon. Friend the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs. Action can then be taken under the powers I have set out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the method of policing agencies, nothing can be done unless cases of misconduct are reported to the relevant authorities—in this case the DTI. Few if any of the cases cited in the hon. Lady's report were reported at the time. To remind schools of the need to report agencies that do not carry out their duties, and to ensure that they know how to do so, we will include an article in the next edition of the Schools Update magazine, which is sent to all schools. I hope that the hon. Lady will welcome that action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady's report also pointed out that a number of head teachers said that the agencies were an improvement on the former LEA-run system. That was a compliment. Schools are under no obligation to continue to use an agency that does not serve them well—as they were previously with LEAs. That kind of direct market pressure is a better way of driving up overall standards than is concentrating on rules, which would be an additional hurdle for those wishing to enter the market—without guaranteeing high standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that schools may need some help in using agencies. We have taken an important step to ensure that schools know what they should expect of agencies, and that agencies have access to advice on what they should be doing when providing schools with teachers. Last year, the Department issued guidance circular 7/96 on the checks that need to be carried out on teachers and the information that schools expect of agencies. That should assist both schools and agencies. Schools therefore have guidance against which to assess the performance of agencies, and they will quickly learn which agencies provide good teachers.

Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Jamieson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There does not appear to be much difference of opinion between us, and I hope that I have gone a long way towards relieving the hon. Lady's fears. I assure her that we have a strong commitment to the protection of children in our schools—a commitment that I know is shared across the Benches. I hope that on the basis of what I have said, the hon. Lady will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that response, and for the positive approach that she and the Government have taken on the issue. I accept that agencies are here to stay, and it is in all our interests—and the interests of our children—to ensure that they work. I am pleased that the Minister will come back to me on the taxation issue because that needs to be addressed, and I would enjoy participating in consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system that the Minister described is reactive, which is fine when things go wrong. What I propose in the new clause is a more proactive, constant auditing of agencies, which I would still prefer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Staffordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that when the Minister said that agencies were open to inspection, she did not say that any had actually been inspected? Once again, it is left to the consumer—the school—to make the approach, rather than to a regulating body. I thought that the Minister was going to tell us how many inspections had taken place and what good reports had been received of agencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. The system is reactive—someone must complain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly reasonable point—I thank the hon. Lady for letting me intervene on her to reply to the hon. Member for South-East Staffordshire (Mr. Jenkins). I do not know whether any agencies have been inspected, but I am quite willing to make inquiries and inform the Committee later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, too, was a useful exchange. I shall leave the matter there. I welcome the clause, but hope that a future Government will tighten the regulatory framework for agencies, so that we have a regular and proactive system of auditing to ensure that nothing goes wrong for our children. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>

This is a technical and tidying-up amendment. Clause 46(1) authorises two sorts of orders. The first is an initial order that would come into effect on the same day as clauses 40 and 46. It deals only with conferred functions, any transfer of property or staff being dealt with by separate orders under clauses 50 and 51 respectively. Any subsequent order under clause 46(1) could include the transfer of property or staff, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is proper that statutory instruments should be subject to the scrutiny of Parliament by the negative resolution procedure.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments and the new clause relate to something that is causing great consternation in the educational world. We have to set them in the context of a profession that has felt under seige for some years; it has certainly felt undervalued as well as underpaid. There may be differences of opinion between the Opposition and the Government on many matters, but we can agree on certain issues, such as that we cannot afford to lose valuable, experienced teachers at the rate at which we have been losing them. We have lost about 150,000 over the past 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that we all agree that it cannot be right for teachers who obtain early retirement on health grounds to return to school—perhaps even to the same school—apparently fit and able to continue teaching. Nor should we encourage the increasingly commonly held notion that the current early retirement arrangements are a right, when they are no such thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Serious problems are arising from the way in which the scheme operates, not least in that it seems to be going into an ever-increasing deficit—at least on paper. If anyone were to plot a graph of the way the trend in early retirement was going, it would alarm any responsible hon. Member. For example, in the past year more than 17,000 teachers took early retirement or retired on the grounds of sickness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers are under tremendous stress. That stress has increased in recent years, almost entirely because of the Government's insensitivity. There will always be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>631</span>
people—and the number may increase—who merit retirement on health grounds. It is one thing to recognise a problem and agree that it has to be addressed; how the Government have gone about addressing it is quite a different matter. They have been tardy, but when they have acted they have been precipitate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several questions need to be answered, although I do not intend to pre-empt the far fuller debate that will undoubtedly take palce when the order is placed before the House. However, answers to some pertinent questions would help to our progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, will the Minister give a full and honest explanation of why the quinquennial review was delayed? The problems stem from that delay, although I know that there are questions about the nature of the pension fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will the Minister tell us what options have been considered, other than the one before us? The letter from the Secretary of State to my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) says that under present arrangements there is a statutory obligation to follow the National Audit Office in this direction, and in this direction only. Can the Minister explain what other options were considered?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, what arrangements have been made for the grant-maintained sector? I understand that a letter has gone to GM schools suggesting that funds are available in the Funding Agency for schools to ensure that their teachers will be able to take early retirement from 53. Does that apply throughout the maintained sector? Has that letter gone to GM schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the strength of teachers' feelings, it would be wrong to apply one system to one set of teachers and a different one to others as teachers are not part of the process that dedcides whether or not a school is grant maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) for that point. The argument for uniform provision has inherent contradictions. Provision affects not only teachers in grant-maintained schools, but those in independent schools and teachers not employed in schools, such as those employed by local authorities or the Ministry of Defence. I applaud attempts to bring coherence to the somewhat chaotic arrangements that obtain, but it would be absurd to have one set of arrangements for staff in grant-maintained schools and another for others. Will the Minister enlighten us on that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[SIR MICHAEL SHERSBY 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>What considerations has the Minister given to changes in the profession's age profile in light of the Government's proposals, which we may debate on the Floor of the House at some later date? We must also consider the impact of that age profile on the morale of
	<span class='label label-info column'>632</span>
the profession. What assessment has been made of its impact on the career prospects of young, aspiring teachers coming into the profession?</p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>I ask that not to be negative but because I, on behalf of the Opposition, would like genuinely to know that the matter has been considered in the round, rather than in a blinkered way because of budgetary considerations. The provision has an impact out of all proportion to the amount of money that it might save; it is not certain that such a saving merits the disturbance caused to the profession. I am sure that the Minister knows that the issue has stirred up more of a hornets' nest in teaching than any other for some time. It is an issue about which the profession, infamous for its divisions on all sorts of other issues, is united.</p>
	<p>I hope that the Under-Secretary will consider the fact that I have nor heard any representative of the teaching profession, nor any local authority, trying in any way to diminish or disregard the extent of the problems faced under the present retirement arrangements. There has been an honesty and openness of view which I hope is shared in general terms by this and any future Government. Teachers and authorities are aware of the problem, that it is in their own interest to resolve it and that political parties do not disagree on the need to resolve it. Our difference lies in how the problem is to be tackled. I hope that the Minister will confirm that she takes seriously the points that have been raised, that she will put on record her willingness to attempt to help redress the imbalance in the morale of the profession and that she will confirm that the Government will relent on the timetable for the introduction of the changes.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Walton for raising the issues of early retirement and teachers' pensions. I note particularly that he supports reforms in those areas and agrees that an undesirable number of teachers retire before the age of 60.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether I was aware of the disquiet among teachers over the proposals on which we are consulting—a consultation that does not close until tomorrow. I am aware of it and also of the ill-informed and mischievous advice from certain quarters which has caused many teachers to misinterpret the paper on which we are consulting. I also know of the threats that have been made if we continue along the lines set out in that paper. None of that has been helpful on a matter which all parties agree needs serious consideration and reform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister understand that her comments are almost guaranteed to upset the teaching profession?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was too quick—I was just getting to that point. I am not trying to upset teachers; I am trying to reassure them. Many teachers

Had he given me time to develop what I was saying, he would know that I was trying to bring comfort to teachers who have been misled into believing that we are stopping early retirement. I note that the hon. Gentleman supports the fact that we are looking at loopholes, but I note, too, that he has not mentioned that we are increasing the death-in-service benefit from one to two years or that we have been examining the retirement provisions for younger teachers and are increasing their payment to 66 weeks. He does not mention any of those other matters that are in the consultation paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way because one or two matters must be put on the record. She is right, and it is important to put on the record, that the proposed changes will not prevent teachers from taking early retirement. I join her and the hon. Member for Walton in being concerned about the high level of early retirement, with four out of five teachers retiring before the age of 60. Will the Minister confirm that, although she is not stopping it, it is in the Government's financial planning assumption that there will be a reduction in early retirements within the first year to about 75 per cent. of the current level, which will reduce to about a half in the next three or four years? Will she give the precise planning figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has obviously read the consultation paper. He knows that I can confirm everything in it, including the premise that we expect to see premature retirements drop by 25 per cent. in the first year. There is no difference between us—and the hon. Member for Walton—on the fact that far too many teachers take early retirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have read the figures in the paper that was sent to us. The difficulty with changing the system is that it has caused more people than hitherto to think about early retirement. Although we may say that the percentage will drop by 25 per cent., there seems to have been an enormous boost in the number of applicants. Obviously, a large proportion of teachers will not get early retirement, but does the Minister have an idea of the impact that the mere announcement of the change has had? I am sure that many teachers who have written to me had not previously wanted early retirement until the Government suggested that they would not get it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must think that I am a mind reader. I have no idea how many teachers have considered early retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Walton clearly said in his opening remarks, teachers have no right to early retirement. It is at the employer's discretion, which is important to remember. The hon. Gentleman raised some specific questions and I can give him an answer on the quinquennial review now. The initial delay was caused by problems with the data that was supplied to the Government actuary. The data requirements were
	<span class='label label-info column'>634</span>
more complex for this valuation and we then had to decide whether or not the cost of premature retirement should remain on the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the final paragraph of the report of the National Audit Office is highly critical of the Department for its failure to provide the appropriate data for the review?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has read that report and does not need me to confirm what it contains. That would be a waste of the Committee's time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments have been requested by the national employers organisation that represents LEAs. It asked the Government to change the position so that LEAs can control the costs of premature retirement in schools. We are happy to do that, and we tabled these amendments for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other matters that the hon. Member for Walton mentioned, we are still in the consultation period; it closes tomorrow. I have heard him ask many questions and he has agreed that there is a problem, but, as usual, I have heard no solutions. I invite him to write to me before the end of the consultation period to put forward his proposals on how he would handle this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way; she is obviously about to finish her speech. She will be aware that a legal action is taking place on these matters. Has she taken advice on whether it would be legal for the Committee to agree to, or even vote on, the amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that those matters have been looked into and that anything that is brought before and agreed to by the Committee is allowable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister understandably suggested that my hon. Friend the Member for Walton asked many questions but offered no solutions, and she implied that she would not answer any of those questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered many of the questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was not about to answer any more of them. No one could complain that my hon. Friend did not offer a solution because, in a sense, he did. As he suggested, no Opposition Member wants a distinction to be made between teachers in grant-maintained schools and those in maintained schools. The Minister should be able to tell us whether different advice has been sent to grant-maintained schools and on what basis they will allow early retirement. We understand that, in the case of a maintained school, the LEA will have to agree to any early retirement, but what process will grant-maintained schools use? Will they be entirely funded by the teachers' superannuation fund?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only difference between GM schools and other schools is in the funding mechanism. I am willing to write to the hon. Gentleman on those matters, which he reasonably raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just thank the Minister for that response? I look forward to her letter. Could she tell me in that letter whether the teachers' superannuation fund will pay the entire cost of early retirements from grant-maintained schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I almost asked if the hon. Gentleman would give way to me; I forgot that I had given way to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yes, that is perfectly reasonable. The hon. Gentleman must understand my caution; we are still in the middle of the consultation period and, as the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said, such a matter is before the courts. However, I am willing to write to the hon. Gentleman on this matter because there has been cross-party recognition of the problem. Many questons have been asked, but no solutions have been given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister will write to us on this matter, I should like to ask another question. She said that the difference between LEA schools and grant-maintained schools was in the funding. Will a burden be placed on the funds of individual GM schools? In other words, will they have to fund the superannuation scheme from their own budgets?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked a detailed, technical question. I undertake to write to him on that subject later, as I have done with other matters. It would be better that reiterating that the funding of the mechanism is different. However, I do not want to mislead the hon. Gentleman, so I shall give him chapter and verse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a mind reader, but I understood the Minister to say in reply to my hon. Friend that the closing date for applications for retirement was in December. The local authorities should by now have collected the figures and the Department should know the total number of applications. Will the Minister say as early as possible what is the total number, and what plans she has for filling that gap?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I gave way to the hon. Gentleman. There is no closing date for applications for retirement; it is up to LEAs to decide. There is no right to early retirement; it is for the employers to decide whether to grant early retirement to teachers who intimate that they wish to retire early.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that teachers do not have a right to early retirement and that it is for the employers to grant it. The Minister must have received many letters from teachers; a constant theme in such letters is that teachers have paid all their working lives into the teachers' superannuation fund, yet the fund apparently cannot help in such circumstances. We should be very concerned if the fund could help some teachers in some schools, but could not help those who happened to teach in LEA-maintained schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>636</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Gentleman is trying to say, but his fears are unfounded. As I stated previously, we all agree that reform is necessary. An open and full consultation on those reforms has been taking place for the past 12 weeks. It closes tomorrow, and I hope that the Opposition parties, even individual hon. Members, will contribute to the consultation process. They know that the reforms are necessary; I hope that they will respond positively if they do not like what is proposed in the consultation paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Although we agree with the Government that there is a problem, it has been exacerbated by the Government's inaction. According to the National Audit Office report, it was in 1989 that the supplement on contributions was reduced from 1.75 per cent. to 0.75 per cent. The situation today might have been slightly different had that change not taken place. There was also a delay in the quinquennial review and not all the options have been presented for our consideration.

Ministers and other Conservative Members are on record as having attacked my right hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) and my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside for reaffirming what every parent—and certainly every teacher—knows to be the case: that homework is in itself a good thing. I know that the Government accept that and that they are bound to make political capital out of proposals that are sincerely made, but which are not necessarily meant to be prescriptive in the way that they have been portrayed as being in the past week or so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Foundation for Educational Research has shown that 43 per cent. of primary schoolchildren are not set regular homework. The links between homework, the raising of standards and a school's success are well known. I am sure that every
	<span class='label label-info column'>638</span>
member of the Committee in his or her dim and distant childhood was set homework, which served as a necessary adjunct to what was done during the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the Department to encourage all schools and authorities in the country to produce systematic guidelines. That would ensure that every child and every parent accept—perhaps as part of the home-school partnership agreement—that homework is the sine qua non for a successful life and an essential preparation for the great world beyond. I am sure that most parents would willingly accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter should not be considered in splendid isolation. Even when homework is set, many children do not have the opportunity to do it. A necessary concomitant for encouraging children to do their homework is the network of homework clubs that extends through the country. Those clubs might be constituted along the lines that the Prince of Wales described this week. The Prince's Trust works in that area, and the Kids Clubs Network provides facilities for children who do not have access to the right conditions in which to do their homework. After-school clubs and many youth clubs give children the comfort, space and—at times— the solitude that they need to do their homework. Many children might otherwise lack those conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that we are asking for a great deal. We want the Department to give its full support to a small but effective proposal. If we are to jack up standards for all children and not for just a few, the Government of the day should pronounce on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have seen several films about the public school institution. The ethos of those schools is to ensure that periods are set aside in the evening in which children can do their homework—often under supervision—and it ensures that they have the appropriate facilities in which to do so. I would like all children to have that opportunity. Good practice is already in place. Many schools and teachers already provide those facilities, but we want to make them standard in all schools and for all children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concur with my hon. Friend the Member for Walton. One of the schools in my constituency is trying to convert its local library into an information centre, not only for children but for parents, because we recognise that sometimes parents need more support to understand what their children do in homework clubs. That sort of approach is good for setting standards so that parents know exactly what is expected of them and of their children when they first approach the school.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is absolutely essential that the spirit of homework is entered into at as early an age as possible. I am sure that any members of the Committee who have, or have had, young children will remember their children coming home from school with homework. At an early age, children are very receptive and homework is a habit that can be formed early on in life.

It is not as if the idea goes against the grain. We have all received letters from younger constituents—I received some recently and read others in a newspaper—who think that this is all part of a dastardly plot to ensure that children cannot do the things they really enjoy doing; that is part of being a child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I enjoy listening to the hon. Gentleman's introduction to the new clause, but I remain puzzled. Can he help the Committee by telling us whether it is the Labour party's view—perhaps this is one interpretation of the new clause—that it is the role of Government to prescribe minimum amounts of homework for children of different ages? After reading newspaper reports about the views of the leader of the Labour party and others, I confess that I am confused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer that point directly. The guidelines set what we consider to be optimum amounts of time that children should spend at different levels of their school careers. But there must be some flexibility in interpreting such guidelines. The important issue is that homework should be seen as de rigueur for all children in all schools. The new clause is intended to be helpful and supportive to the Government's avowed intention to raise standards. If the Government really mean it, this is one way in which they could help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that it? Just the other day, the nation was stunned when the right hon. Member for Sedgefield, the Leader of the Opposition, startled us with his radical and revolutionary proposal that every child of a certain age should do 30 minutes of homework and older children should do 90 minutes of homework every night. Since then, we have all been agog to know quite how that would work, what degree of compulsion or flexibility there would be, how it would be enforced and how education would benefit from such a thrusting, radical and revolutionary new thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now a rather more modest proposal has emerged, which suggests guidelines. In answer to the question from the hon. Member for Bath, the hon. Member for Walton said, with characteristic modesty, pragmatism and realism, that no one would be compelled to do much and it must all be flexible. I welcome the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman has tabled the new clause, which the Committee will recognise rather more easily than the startling announcements made a few days ago. But I am sure that hon Members will want to ponder these matters and distil where the reality lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no difference between us on the value of homework. The Secretary of State asked Ofsted to look into the role of homework, and in 1995, it produced a report entitled "Homework in Primary and Secondary Schools". My right hon. Friend also commissioned a report from the University of London's Institute of Education and Keele university,
	<span class='label label-info column'>640</span>
which was published earlier this week—I circulated it to the Committee—and which took the argument about the value of homework further forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee will know, we have made available a grant to help some schools to establish homework clubs and to make similar provision, the better to carry forward the value of homework in different school contexts. Yet again, we are faced with the reality in education. Although we can all identify the value of homework—most of us recall our circumstances when doing it—we must recognise that such are the variations in circumstances of individual pupils and of individual schools, in the relationship between pupils and teachers in the classroom and in the pace at which pupils advance that to set out rigid figures for homework is not hopelessly unrealistic, but in many cases could be positively dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Gesture politics is one thing; hopeless aspirations are another; spin-doctoring headlines may be a third. The Committee is involved with none of those things; we are involved with the serious business of legislation, and of trying to maximise educational betterment and ensure the raising of standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that the hon. Member for Walton moved this modest new clause in a pragmatic and realistic way—I leave others to judge how we can reconcile what burst upon the world last weekend with what we have heard in Committee today. Having said that, it is not necessary or wise to accept the new clause. As I said earlier, the value of homework is well recognised and well documented, and we are providing a modest sum to pilot practical measures to carry forward the recognition of homework in schools, according to their individual circumstances. The matter is, therefore, well in hand and can be carried forward perfectly adequately within the provisions of existing law, so the new clause is completely redundant and I urge the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Another item that divides not only Labour Members from Government Members, but the Government from the rest of the education service and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>641</span>
the world is class size. We believe that class size makes a difference. We are not the only people who believe that; lots of evidence from this country and overseas supports that point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Research recently undertaken by Professor Peter Mortimore, the director of the University of London's Institute of Education, concluded that class size makes a difference, especially in the important early years. The recent Ofsted report—published last year, I think—said that class size was a factor influencing effective teaching and learning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the only factor that makes a difference or the only thing that we have to change to raise standards; other things are also important. A relatively small class could be badly taught, and we would not be any further forward. However, class size is a very important factor in determining whether a teacher is able to teach effectively and whether students are able to learn effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents share that view. I suspect that one of the reasons why parents choose the independent sector is the guarantee of small class sizes. I am not aware of an independent school that would dream of saying to parents who were handing over cash, "We are going to put your child in a class of more than 30 or 40." If it did, I suspect that children would be quickly withdrawn from that school. However, those of us responsible for the state sector are saying just that to 1.3 million primary school children who are in classes of more than 30 and 14,000 primary school children trying to learn lessons in classes of more than 40.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given what she said about the independent sector, my hon. Friend may be interested to know that on 12 December the heads of independent schools in Wales published a review of their excellent GSCE results and said that the primary reason for that excellence was small classes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can quite understand that. Class size makes a difference. There is no evidence to show that it does not. The Government have, indeed, been lax in commissioning research into class size. I tabled a parliamentary question last year asking on what information Government assessments of the effect of class size on attainment were based, only to be told that no such research had been commissioned. Not only are the Government not concerned to reduce class size, but they have not even identified it as a proper matter for research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents want to make sure that their children—particularly at primary level—get the attention that they need, have the opportunity to be heard reading every day, are closely monitored and have any problems identified early for action. Small classes—fewer than 30 pupils in primary schools—will, by definition, enable teachers to spend more time with each child and give a better quality education. Class size is not the only factor, but it can make a real difference to raising standards for all our children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>642</span>
The new clause is modest. It does not call for an immediate reduction of class size to 20 throughout the education sector, but it requires education authorities to set targets for maximum pupil numbers in
	<br><blockquote><p>"such years and year groups as the Secretary of State may specify."</p></blockquote>
The Committee is aware of the Labour party's clear pledge that no child of five, six or seven will be in a class of more than 30. We have made clear where the resources will come from to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time is more pressing at today's sitting than on any other, so I shall not take much longer. Class size matters. We are reflecting the wishes of all children in this country and the views of teachers. There is ample evidence to back our view that class size is a factor that contributes to more effective teaching and learning. We approach the millennium with all parties naming education as a great need for our country's future, and it is a disgrace that we allow 1.3 million five, six and seven-year-olds to have to manage in classes of more than 30. That is not teaching; it is more like crowd control. The new clause goes some way to making sure that class size is on everyone's agenda and that we move practically to reduce it as soon as we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish my point. The hon. Lady's point about parental choice is bogus. It is interesting that parents often clamour to get their children into a popular and oversubscribed school which provides an excellent level of education, even if that means that their child will contribute to an increased class size in that school, while neglecting to apply to the school down the road which might provide small class sizes but a rotten education. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris) mentioned independent schools. I ask her to consider Hackney Downs, a school so bad that it had to be closed down but which had a pupil-teacher ratio of 8:1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that class size is just one element in a matrix of elements that make an effective school? Will he ponder the comment made by my hon. Friend the Member for Yardley about the answer she was given to her parliamentary question, which was that the Government had no intention of conducting research into that vexed question? Will he consider that in the context of the Tennessee Star project in America, which was evidential on the relationship between class size and performance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must be desperate if he has to scrape the barrel for that example. I yield to none in my admiration for things American—I am married to one, for goodness sake—but I draw the line somewhere. The problem with that sort of research is that it tends, as do many such projects in the United States, to focus on a particular approach to education or employment—a subject with which I am also
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>643</span>
familiar—set up a project, fund it well and examine its conclusions, but then fail to take it further. As the hon. Member for Walton knows, that approach could not be replicated across the United States because, apart from anything else, It would be grotesquely expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to another point made by the hon. Member for Yardley. She repeated the bogus undertaking that by abolishing the assisted places scheme—I shall not get involved in debating the merits of that because I know, Sir Michael, that you would not want me to—she and her party, were they to be in government, would fund the reduction of class sizes. In reality, the abolition of the assisted places scheme might save about £5 million in the first year—and about £24 million eventually. That initial saving of £5 million would pay for about 200 primary teachers, or one for every 90 schools. The problem with the argument is that it is all done by mirrors; it relies on omitting to mention the cost of educating those pupils who are currently being educated in the independent sector of the fact that the savings would not pay for the number of teachers required to achieve the necessary class size targets. The hon. Lady would therefore have to go to her right hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) before the general election to get an explicit undertaking that were he to be Chancellor of the Exchequer, he would find enough money to make up the difference between the abolition of the assisted places scheme and meeting the class size targets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister just referred to having to cater for children in the assisted places scheme who, under our proposals, would return to the state sector. Could he tell the Committee how much extra money his Government have made available for the increase in pupil numbers over the past years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The financing of the education system is a matter of public record. If the hon. Lady examines any element of education—past and present pupil-teacher ratios, teacher numbers year on year or the real terms money given to education—she will find that in every case the record is far better than it was, for example, in—I pick a date entirely at random—1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make just one more point as I do not wish to test the patience of the Committee. The other implication of the Opposition's proposal is that rather than giving schools, governing bodies and heads the discretion to move around the money they have available to determine class sizes in different subjects and different circumstances, it decrees from the centre an absolute maximum of pupils in a class, regardless of the circumstances of the school, the class, the teacher, the pupils or the subject. The hon. Lady for Yardley, with her distinguished record in education, must know better than that. She must know that an attempt arbitrarily to set the size of classes in crude terms of numbers, regardless of all those criteria, could be potentially damaging to education. In every respect, the hon. Lady's argument holds no water. It is gesture politics of the worst kind and it could not possibly be
	<span class='label label-info column'>644</span>
fulfilled by this Government or any other. For those reasons, I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment resoundingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My natural modesty and reticence does not allow me to say that all those who have chaired the Committee have been as competent and able as you, but perhaps I can say that the overwhelming majority have done so with great care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting to hear the Minister of State talking about class size. I recall him talking on the Floor of the House about three years ago on nursery education. He said at that time that my hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury (Mrs. Taylor) was obsessed with nursery education and that there was no evidence that nursery education benefitted children. A matter of months later, the Prime Minister got up at the conference and, to the great embarrassment of the Minister of State, contradicted him. Suddenly, the Minister of State sees a flash of light on the road to the conference and he is converted to nursery education; he is now a great proponent of it. He has to be because his right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has said so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same arguments are now being rehearsed on class size. Any research that has been done—whether in the United States or by Professor Mortimore in this country—is rubbished by the Minister of State because it does not suit his prejudices. The Government know that class sizes in most schools in the maintained sector are increasing. Teachers know that it matters and, more importantly, so do parents. I can imagine the Minister of State thinking that perhaps his right hon. Friend the Prime Minister may make a statement in the next week or so saying that class size is important. The Minister of State will be there supporting him and calling on Professor Mortimore's evidence and that from Tennessee and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consider all the proposed legislation, it is interesting to note that the Government have ignored the independent sector. None of it applies to that sector. I have talked about the national curriculum, testing, Ofsted and even about taxpayers' money being used in independent schools, but none of the proposals apply to them. The Government have ignored the advice on the matter of class size in the independent sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a shame that the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) has not been here so far this morning. I mentioned Dover college in an earlier debate and I have had a pleasant exchange in writing with that college. I note that it placed an advertisement in 	<i>The Independent Schools in the UK</i> in 1996 stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Small class sizes (the staff:pupil ratio is 1:10) … gives the school a genuine sense of purpose."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>645</span>
I have brochures from a large number of independent schools and they always say that small class size is important. The Minister should take note of what the independent sector is saying because it is right. David Woodhead, the national director of the Independent Schools Information Service, in an article headed,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where small makes common sense",</p></blockquote>
states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Does class size matter? Common sense says yes. So do most independent sector parents. In any survey of parents' reasons for choosing independent schools, smaller classes are mentioned among the most influential factors".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most happy to give way to the Minister and I look forward to his confirming that he agrees with that view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do nothing of the sort. My common sense and judgment as a parent led me to consider the option of paying a lot of fees to send my children to independent schools with small class sizes or sending them to schools in the state sector. I happily and readily chose the state sector for my children. That was my view then; it is my view now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also happily chose the state sector and maintained schools for my children for various reasons, not least the excellence of the comprehensive and primary schools that they had attended in the area. I would be interested to know whether the Minister would have been happier for his children to be in smaller classes in the schools that he chose or in classes that contained, say, about 40 children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's argument is of no relevance; he persists in missing the point. As I said earlier, real evidence shows that real parents making real choices for their children will choose a popular school that provides good education regardless of class sizes. They will do so even in the knowledge that the attendance of their children at the school would increase the size of the classes, and over and above a blind preference for rotten education in small classes—as opposed to good education in large classes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course any parent would choose a school that was good, as opposed to one that was poor, whatever the circumstances. However, if the Minister's children were taught in classes of more than 40 children and it was obvious that the size of the classes was inhibiting their proper progress, would not he make a serious complaint about that situation? I receive such complaints from parents in my constituency. They say that, particularly in the early years, the size of the class inhibits the rapid progress of their children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend remind the Committee of the views of the chief inspector who, in evidence to the Select Committee and other arenas, has said consistently that class size is a relevant factor in improving standards for children in the early years of
	<span class='label label-info column'>646</span>
their formal education—at ages five, six and seven? Is not it a dereliction of duty for the Minister to ignore that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I should be interested to hear whether the Minister agrees with the chief inspector. I think that the Secretary of State said in her evidence before the Select Committee that she agreed that evidence showed that class size made a difference in the early years. However, it is academic whether the Government agree or disagree with that notion because they will not be carrying forward such policies in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to refer again to the comments of David Woodhead. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If smaller classes are good enough for independent schools, they are good enough for other types of schools, too."</p></blockquote>
I agree. The evidence in support of smaller class sizes is overwhelming. That is shown in academic evidence from this country and abroad, in evidence from the independent sector, from governors and teachers in the maintained sector and, in particular, in the evidence that we receive from parents who send their children to schools where they perceive that the class sizes are too large for the children to receive a proper education. For those reasons, I support the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) and the evidence that he put forward support the argument that class size makes a difference. The Government have had a blinkered approach. They have not considered the matter in a way that would gather evidence. One of their hang-ups is that no matter what evidence is produced and no matter what anyone says, they have no intention of adopting a proper and responsible attitude to the matter and considering the effect of class size on children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that the Minister has sent his children to state school. That is laudable, but the truth is that the children of most of his colleagues in the Cabinet and on the Government Benches are not expected to learn in their vital early years in classes of more than 30 or 40 pupils. It is the Government's policies that have created the situation in which many other people's children must learn in such circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have two problems. They have not yet even accepted that class size makes a difference. Should we be unlucky enough to see them continue in office, it will be a long time before they address that problem. Their failure even to jump the first hurdle means they cannot jump the second to reduce class sizes. Class size makes a difference, although it is not the only way to raise standards. The new clause is a reasonable means to reduce sizes and we shall return to the point later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>STAFFING FOR SCHOOLS WHERE DELEGATION HAS BEEN SUSPENDED</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"In section 133 of the Education Act 1996 in subsection (4) at the end there shall be inserted 'except that, where delegation has been suspended under section 117, the local education authority may also suspend the provisions of the Articles of Government specified in Schedule 13'.".—[	<i>Mr. Gunnell.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a small clause dealing with a matter not previously discussed. It attempts to tidy up something left over by the Education Act 1996 which may cause some schools difficulty. If a school in serious difficulty is not managing its budget satisfactorily, section 117 of the Education Act 1996 provides for the suspension of financial delegation. In such extreme circumstances there has often been serious mismanagement, so there must also be scope to suspend the devolved powers for the appointment of trusts under section 133 and schedule 13 of the 1996 Act. Where there has been serious mismangement, it is illogical to leave the governors to operate staffing policy. Staff are a large part of a school's budget. Our position is logical in seeking to let LEAs make staffing changes when delegation is suspended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current position is unsatisfactory. If a school has major difficulties, the LEA can withdraw financial delegation, but the governing body retains responsibility for staffing. That can obstruct a school's getting back on track. Where financial delegation has been suspended as a result of mismanagement by governors or senior staff, the circumstances might be such that staffing changes are needed to bring the budget into line. Governors are not in the best position to manage that, given that their financial responsibilities have been suspended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>648</span>
In those circumstances, the LEA should be able to take control of that key area, but that does not mean that it is required to do so. The amendment is carefully worded; it would not require the LEA to take control unless it thought that the school's governors were not managing the staff responsibly. In such cases, the LEA should have the power to take the required staffing decisions. However, the LEA might not know whether the difficulties had been caused by the staffing decisions that the governors made when financial delegation was suspended. The new clause aims to solve that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is trying to tidy up the law, but he is doing so slightly prematurely. Clearly, schedule 13 of the Education Act 1996 was not designed to deal with a school where delegation had been suspended, but I am inclined to resist the new clause for two reasons. First, we are undertaking a review of local management of schools, and this matter should be considered as part of that review, in which relevant interests are being considered. It would be counter-productive to rush into legislation now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I do not think that the new clause represents the best way to amend the law—perhaps simply repealing schedule 13 of the 1996 Act would improve and simplify it. We can best achieve the results that might be deemed necessary when the review has been concluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear why we need to legislate urgently on this matter; it is rare for delegation to be suspended in schools, and it would be foolish to rush into legislation now. We shall come to a considered view in the context of the review of local management of schools, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I understand that the Minister does not want to consider it on a one-off basis but I hope that, as she is undertaking a review, she will consider cases in which financial delegation is suspended.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, we hope that the Ministers will grasp this opportunity to adopt a proposal which, although perhaps not as significant as others that we have debated, represents a practical, pragmatic way to deal with an unnecessary administrative and financial burden which a recent interpretation of the Data Protection Act 1984 has placed on schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until 1991, everyone assumed that when a local education authority registered with the Data Protection Registrar, all schools, heads and governing bodies in that LEA were covered under the 1984 Act. However, in 1991, the Department for Education prepared advice in consultation with the Data Protection Registrar, which stated that schools, heads and governing bodies were not covered by one registration alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that time, the Department for Education argued that, as different bodies would make different use of the data—LEAs may use it for one purpose, whereas schools and governing bodies may use it for other purposes—separate registrations were required. In fact, that advice was confirmed in a recent letter from officials to the Association of County Councils dated 21 November. I shall briefly cite one extract which reads as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In relation to the functions of an individual school, it may well be that the data they hold on computer may only be held, in part, for and on behalf of the LEA. It is possible that in keeping some data, head teachers are the agents of the Governors. It is also possible that in keeping some data, head teachers are holders of data processed for, by or on behalf of themselves. It is the presence of these three distinct possibilities that has given rise to the advice that to stay within the law requires the registration of the LEA, the Governors and the head teacher."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Minister will agree that it is an administrative mess. Three registrations means three sets of fees at £75 each, and schools and governors must re-register every three years. It is therefore a recurring cost. Local authority associations have assessed that it will cost in the region of £4 million. It is interesting to note that, during our discussions on an earlier new clause, the Minister said that £5 million would buy about 200 primary teachers—I cannot remember the precise figure—so £4 million would buy a few less but could still be put to better use than being spent on registration. We all want to ensure that the rights of citizens are safeguarded under data protection legislation but the current arrangements represent a costly overkill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During debates on the Education Act 1993, an amendment identical to the proposed new clause was tabled in another place. In replying to the amendment, Lord Henley said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As the deregulation Minister in the Department of Social Security … we both appreciate the burden that the present requirement to register places on schools. We therefore have some sympathy with the arguments in favour of simplification of the present arrangements. The Data Protection Registrar has also
	<span class='label label-info column'>650</span>
acknowledged that there is a case for some simplification of the registration requirements."—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 13 May 1993; Vol. 545, c. 1485.]</p></blockquote>
Everyone agrees that the current scheme is wasteful, bureaucratic and costly, so I hope that the Committee will accept this simple new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When consideration was given to a similar clause in 1993, the Government said that they wanted to wait for the outcome of an EC directive on data protection before introducing legislation. That directive was adopted in October 1995 and is due to be implemented in October 1998. As I understand it, the directive allows for the simplification of registration and for exemptions in certain circumstances. In replying to the debate, I hope that the Minister will tell the Committee whether she sees the directive as an opportunity to achieve our objective of reducing what we all consider to be an unnecessary financial and administrative burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to mention one other argument. If only one person is the authorised user and able to input data—even though the data will be used by other people through networks—why should there be three registrations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will support the new clause but, if she does not, I hope that she will respond to two other suggestions. First, if three registrations are too many, would two be possible? Thus LEA would have to register but schools and governing bodies would not have to register separately. That would slightly lessen the stupidity of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the Minister agrees with my second suggestion but is not in a position to implement it. Income to the Data Protection Registrar goes straight to the Treasury, which benefits from the absurdity. Rather than losing the money from education, would it be appropriate for the Treasury to foot the bill? I see that officials' heads are shaking. However, it makes common sense—it certainly makes educational sense—not to waste taxpayers' money or to take it away from education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will accept this sensible new clause, which is a quick way of dealing with a minor irritation and stupidity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great sympathy with some of the points that the hon. Lady made, but, like many things in life, this is the wrong clause in the wrong Bill at the wrong time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Lady's suggestion that it is ridiculous for schools to have to register twice. However, the requirement for separate registration by LEAs, head teachers and governors is not simply bureaucratic. It stems from the concern that was dealt with in the Data Protection Act 1984 to make data users accountable to data subjects. She was right to say that LEAs and schools hold the data for different purposes. A single registration for each LEA and its schools is unlikely to prove workable and would not deserve the safeguards that underlie the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I hope that it will be possible to ease the registration burdens on schools. The Home Office is working on the implementation of the European Community data protection directive, which allows
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>651</span>
considerable scope for exemptions from the data protection regime, which must be in force by 24 October 1998. The Home Office is in the process of consulting widely and is developing proposals for taking on board representations that have already been made to it about the existing regime, including the need for the dual registration of schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be sensible to consider changes to the existing data protection scheme in the context of forthcoming legislation dealing with data protection rather than in the Education Bill. I hope that the hon. Lady will not press the new clause to a vote—if she does, I hope that it will be negatived.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's comments, but this is such a simple and obvious proposal that I am minded to push the new clause to a vote. It should take effect immediately, and she has not argued for the need to wait longer. When we had a similar debate in 1993, Ministers showed some sympathy with the proposal, and, three and a half years later, we still have sympathy but no action. It is time for Ministers to act and to support a sensible, pragmatic new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the last new clause, and, indeed, the last of our debates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Formally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. There is a good case to be made for establishing a general teaching council analogous to the General Medical Council. Many members of the Committee and others with experience of teaching will know that it has for many years been a bone of contention among teachers that they do not have the professional status that they rightly believe ought to be accorded them. It is generally recognised that one of the best ways to raise educational standards is to improve the quality of work of classroom teachers. It is policies and practices that help and encourage all teachers to teach better which will make a real difference to the achievements of all our children.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has become the clarion call of the Government—although their actions say otherwise—that the raising of educational standards has taken over from their preoccupation with structures. There is now a strong body of professional opinion that something must be done to raise the morale and status of the teaching profession, especially given the Government's attacks on it during recent years. Teachers have come in for heavy criticism during the past decade—regrettably, most of it has emanated from the Government and their paid servants and charges in various agencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The front page story in 	<i>The Times Education Supplement</i> of 10 January reported a survey that the paper had carried out which showed that teacher morale was at an all-time low. I cannot see what that does to lever up standards. Teachers feel oppressed by perpetual public criticism and consider that their professionalism is further undermined by Government interference—the Government will be remembered for that when they are cast into the outer darkness of Opposition for—we hope—a generation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one would defend poor performace or argue that incompetence should be condoned. However, generalised abuse of an entire profession—as appears to be practised by some parts of the press, often at the behest of Ministers and their more extreme right-wing supporters, which these days means the majority of the parliamentary Conservative party; most of its aspiring candidates are also of that ilk—fails to address the shortcomings of the minority of poor teachers, but it depresses and casts down the majority of good and competent teachers. Even the chief inspector of schools, despite his unfortunate choice of emphasis and phraseology, has belatedly recognised that the vast majority of teachers do a tremendous job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Commercial management practice and educational theory agree that praise for good work and encouragement for individuals to take responsibility for their own development raise morale and performance. Creating a general teaching council would empower teachers themselves to take charge of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>653</span>
raising the quality and standards of their profession. There is every reason to expect that that would do more to raise professional standards within teaching and boost the quality of recruits to the profession than any amount of hectoring from the Government and the tabloid press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the esablishment of a general teaching council is needed urgently, not only because standards of teaching need to be improved, but because there is a danger of a teacher shortage developing in the near future. When we debate the order about the teacher pension scheme, which we have touched on briefly today, we will discover that the Government face real problems of teacher recruitment and that the present Government have lowered the number expected to be recruited to the profession, notwithstanding the fact that the increased need for specialist teachers in some areas is alarming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to encourage people to join the profession and to understand that it is a worthy one. I have only to look around the Committee to see many excellent ex-teachers who were so worthy that their constituents, recognising their outstanding merits as individuals and professionals, saw fit to send them here to represent them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the economy picks up—as the Government continually assure us it is doing—disaffected and demoralised teachers will leave the profession for areas of employment where their skills, talents and professionalism are appreciated; similarly, teacher training institutions will increasingly fail in the competition with other employers for good graduates to replace those teachers. Those factors mean that the time has come for a general teaching council. As usual, the Government are the last to catch up with the tide of change, but it still might not be too late to encourage them to give this progressive measure the support that it deserves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The time for a general teaching council may have come and such a body may make the contribution that the hon. Member for Walton described. However, several fundamental questions would need to be answered before we could progress on the lines set out in the new clause. For example, if there is such a groundswell of demand among teachers for a council, does it need to be created by statute? Could it not be created by popular support among teachers? Related to that point is the issue of funding, which is not covered in the new clause—the hon. Gentleman might say that it does not need to be at this stage. Would the body have to be funded by taxpayers' money or could it be funded by teacher subscription?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend—it is a pleasure to use that phrase—will know that such a body, the General Teaching Council for Scotland, has existed since 1969. Is he aware that the only way teachers could be persuaded to register with it was having the then Labour Secretary of State for Scotland tell them that they would be sacked if they did not? Is he aware that Aberdeen town council told me that if I
	<span class='label label-info column'>654</span>
did not vote for the sacking of teachers who refused to register, I would be surcharged by the then Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend who anticipated, with his usual uncanny percipience, my next point, which was to ask whether Opposition Members would argue for a general teaching council south of the border similar to the one that has been established for some time in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Successfully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says "successfully"; that is a matter for judgment. I am not sure that my hon. Friends would agree that the Scottish model should be emulated. A decision that it should would pre-empt the vital question of whether a general teaching council would take over some or all of the functions of, for example, the Teacher Training Agency. The body's constitution and composition are also vital questions; many important issues on the relationship that the teaching council might have with, for example, the teacher unions should also be considered. My final point in that context is the interesting one of professional liability and indemnity. The hon. Member for Walton teasingly mentioned the General Medical Council as a possible model for the general teaching council, which is an idea that we shall examine seriously. We shall consider in depth the role played by the GMC in regard to liability and indemnity in the medical profession and how that might compare to the teaching profession. Those are profound and important issues about which we would have to be much more satisfied than we are at present. So while the idea has merit and I accept the hon. Gentlemen's point that it may have widespread support among teachers, too many important questions need to be resolved before we can progress—and certainly before we can progress with the proposal in the new clause that the body have a statutory basis. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we are ending on a note of reasonableness and pragmatism, which reflects the way in which most of our proceedings have been conducted. I was quite taken by some of the Minister's comments. I can tell the hon. Member for Hendon, South that we should not emulate everything from north of the border, although there are lessons to be learnt. However, I confess to being mystified by many things Scottish—not least some hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I hope that the Minister's invisible friends have taken note of the growing consensus in Committee, in the House and within the profession. They should prepare themselves for the advent of a Labour Government and the establishment of a general teaching council, which I sure will receive the support that it deserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's objections were limited. He seems to have taken off the hat that he donned early in our proceedings as the Minister for consultation. He could have announced yet another consultation on how to overcome the small obstacles that he places in our path.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>655</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not contributed to this debate because of the shortage of time. Is the hon. Gentleman aware of my party's considerable support for the introduction of a general teaching council? However, we share some of the Minister's concerns about the details of the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well recall at a press conference during my by-election campaign referring to the Liberal Democrat party as the party of Janus because it faces both ways at once. Of course, that does the Liberal Democrat party a disservice because it has more faces than 1,000 Januses. Whoever the candidate, one is given the opinion that he or she thinks one deserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In light of the Minister's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. It falls to me to express, on behalf of the Committee, our gratitude, principally to you, for the way in which you have chaired the Committee. We started confident that it would be chaired in the way that we have come to expect—with calmness, competence, and understanding for all members of the Committee. Thus it has turned out. It is in no small way due to you, Sir Michael, that the Committee's proceedings have been so smooth and happy. I link with that our thanks to Mr. O'Hara for his part in similarly chairing the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish also to record our thanks to the Committee Clerk for guiding you, Sir Michael, and all members of the Committee so expertly through the maze that the Bill has sometimes been; and to the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters who, as ever, have with patience and great professionalism picked every gem and pearl and caused them to be recorded for posterity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to thank my officials, who sit so patiently behind me, impassive and mute—and often horrified at what I say. For their expertise, I am most grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank all members of the Committee, not least my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, who has so ably conducted the debate on those parts of the Bill that she took on, for the spirit in which they have conducted themselves—apart from the odd electronic interruption, which so intrigued us. I thank those other hon. Members who so ably chaired the Committee—
	<span class='label label-info column'>656</span>
my hon. Friends the Members for Gravesham (Mr. Arnold) and for Finchley (Mr. Booth), and the hon. Member for Devonport. Finally, I express my gratitude to a Committee that has done its work well, speedily and, above all, with a spirit of comradeship and happiness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. I endorse most of what the Minister said. I was hoping that he would lay to rest the rumour that he received his Privy Councillorship for his sterling efforts on the first four parts of the Bill. At this point, I should record my thanks to the hon. Members for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) and for Hendon, South, who presented us with the marvellous gift of removing a whole clause from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I extend a fond farewell to the Conservative members of the Committee; I doubt whether they will again have the pleasure of appearing in a Standing Committee on the Government Benches. Indeed, we look forward to them being in Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I offer my thanks to you, Sir Michael, to Mr. O'Hara and to all the staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Minister of State and the hon. Member for Walton for their kind remarks; I shall, of course, pass them on to my co-Chairman, Mr. O'Hara.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Walton, in his last speech, referred to praise for good work and to individuals. He might like to know that the Committee has endured 16 sittings over 11 separate days—a total of 40 hours—and has called 53 Divisions in its consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to record my gratitude for the good work of the individual members of the Committee. It has been a happy Committee and members of both sides have got on well. I am particularly glad that hon. Members from both sides have had the opportunity to chair the Committee; it is one of the things that brings about the magic cohesion that enables us all, whatever our views, to get on as a team. I have always attached considerable importance to that and I thank you all very much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also add the thanks of the Committee, as ever, to the gallant gentlemen and ladies of the Metropolitan Police who have made sure that we are safe during our deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
