	<section>
	<div class='title'>DETENTION OUTSIDE SCHOOL HOURS LAWFUL DESPITE ABSENCE OF PARENTAL CONSENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment moved [12 December]</i>: No. 163, in page 20, line 28, after 'case', insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(aa) whether regard has been had to the length of the walking route between the school and the pupil's home, and whether the cost of transport if required will be available to the school other than from resources otherwise allocated in its annual budget'.—[	<i>Mr. Win Griffiths.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the conclusion of our previous sitting, I was saying that the amendment aims to give some defence for the school. I had referred to walking distance and the need to consider the safety and length of the route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is some uncertainty about whether the school must make the transport arrangements, which could involve additional cost and which, in turn, would filter through to the local authority that provides the school's finance through formula funding. In the case of grant-maintained schools, that would involve the money that they receive from both the local authority and directly from the Government. An additional financial cost could be incurred if the school must provide the transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen in rural areas if the child has only the school transport by which to return home? Will the school have to provide for the cost of a taxi or will the parent have to do so? Furthermore, what will happen when the local authority provides free transport because the journey is beyond the distance that it is considered reasonable to walk, for example, two miles for five to seven-year-olds and three miles for eight to 16-year-olds? Will the school have to provide the transport? I hope that the Minister will take up such issues in his response, so we will know on whom the responsibility will lie for the funding of the provision of transport for children kept in school in detention, particularly in rural areas where it is much more difficult to provide alternative transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already made it clear that the clause safeguards the legitimate rights of children and parents. It ensures that there are reasonable limits on detention for children who misbehave. Schools will not have an unqualified right to impose detention. Among other things, they will have to have regard to the child's age, any special educational needs that the child may have, any religious requirements affecting the child and whether
	<span class='label label-info column'>456</span>
suitable travel arrangements can reasonably be made by the parents when transport is necessary to get the child from school to home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause already covers substantially the main intent of the amendment, which is whether suitable travel arrangements can reasonably be made by the parent when transport is necessary. I emphasise deliberately the words "by the parent", because that is where the responsibility will lie. There should be no cost implications for the school. The clause contains the all-inclusive phrase "any special circumstances" relevant to the detention's imposition, which the school will have to take into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for making it absolutely clear that the burden of providing the transport will fall on the parent. What will happen, however, if a parent refuses to make transport arrangements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As with so many other aspects of school management and relationships between the school and the parents, the school will have to decide whether the attitude of such parents begins to affect materially the child's position at the school. In the other words, if the recalcitrance or the non-co-operative nature of the parent denies the school the use of the provisions under the clause, the school will have to consider what other measures are available. I accept the inevitable difficulty; we are trying to provide schools with as much scope as possible reasonably to use after-school detention, but with appropriate safeguards. I fully acknowledge that in this, as throughout education, we expect the co-operation of parents. If we are unable to obtain it, we must consider other measures, perhaps more drastic, which is all that is left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the all-inclusive phrase "any special circumstances". I believe that it is sufficiently broad to cover such matters as the length and safety of the walking route between the school and the pupils's home. The amendment is therefore unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the underlying concerns about the safety of pupils returning home after detention and about difficult and non-co-operative parents. Those are important matters. In some circumstances, it may never be reasonable to detain certain children after school, however bad their conduct. For example, a school could probably not reasonably impose an after-school detention on a child who lived a long distance from the school and whose only—I stress the word only—means of travelling home was on a bus leaving immediately after the end of the school day. However, that should not be an escape clause for those parents for whom making alternative arrangements would simply be inconvenient. If after-school detention was not possible, the school would probably want to consider detention at lunchtime or another suitable sanction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already made clear that we intend to produce comprehensive guidance about the practicalities of imposing detention. Respondents to consultation in the summer stressed the need for guidance about, among other things, responsibility for making transport arrangements and when it would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0351">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>457</span>
necessary, and about child protection. The sort of detail that the amendment seeks to introduce into the Bill is best dealt with in guidance doubtless after further consultation. I therefore urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that comprehensive and succinct response. I have every confidence that he will take account of all the problems that I mentioned. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 22 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 23</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>VARIATION OF LIMIT ON FIXED-PERIOD EXCLUSIONS: ALL MAINTAINED SCHOOLS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Kilfoyle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Walton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 198, in page 21, line 3, after 'school', insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(a) after subsection (1) there shall be inserted—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Where the headteacher of a school exercises his power to exclude a pupil for a period of more than three days, he shall secure that the educational needs of that pupil continue to be met"; and (b)'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment is designed to clarify and strengthen the Bill's provisions on excluding pupils from school. We believe that there should be no doubt about a school's responsibility for the continuing education of pupils who have been temporarily excluded. The amendment does precisely that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A clear distinction exists between a fixed-term exclusion and a permanent exclusion. The distinction is better expressed, in old terminology, by the words suspension and expulsion. When pupils are expelled they are removed from the school's roll. The connection between school, pupil and parent is severed and the school no longer has a duty to educate the pupil. That duty remains with the parent and it reverts to the local education authority to secure suitable provision. However, when pupils are excluded for a fixed period—suspended—the school still retains its responsibility to that pupil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sanction of fixed-term exclusion is part of a school's tool kit for upholding its disciplinary policies. Members on both sides of the Committee agree on that, but the weight of professional opinion is that a fixed-term exclusion should not be seen as a punishment in itself. From society's point of view—and school is a microcosm of society—withdrawing the opportunity to be educated from troublesome individuals is a self-defeating policy. The lack of a successful education is closely associated with socially damaging behaviour later in life. Rather, temporary exclusions are a device to facilitate other methods of dealing with disciplinary problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be necessary in the wake of serious incidents to separate the protagonists to provide a cooling-off period and allow investigations into the facts of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>458</span>
case. Such a situation also emphasises the need for parents to become involved; we believe that suspensions, or temporary exclusions, should remain in force until a forward-thinking strategy has been agreed with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the first day or two of a fixed exclusion it may not be practical to require the continuation of the excluded pupil's school work. The exclusion may have been imposed rapidly while important matters, such as physical violence, are dealt with urgently. However, if the exclusion is allowed to persist longer than the time required for urgent action or for a brief breathing space, it is important that the school should take positive steps to ensure that the excluded pupil's education continues while he or she is out of school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advice and guidance set out in the Department for Education and Employment circular 10/94 makes it clear that that is Government policy. Paragraph 51 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The head teacher of the excluding school should wherever practicable make arrangements for the pupil who is excluded for a fixed period to receive school work to do at home and to have it marked until he or she returns to school. The governing body should keep these arrangements under review."</p></blockquote>
That is not made explicit in the Bill, however, and it is possible to misread section 19 of the Education Act 1996—which provides that LEAs should have responsibility for excluded pupils, but does not draw a distinction between temporary and permanent exclusions—so as to believe that the guidance does not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would put the matter beyond doubt by setting out the duty of the head teacher to prevent a temporary exclusion from being a complete interruption to a child's education—we want to ensure that that appears clearly in the Bill. The amendment would strengthen the Bill by underlining and reaffirming an existing element of Government policy that we fully support. I hope that the Minister recognises the worth of the amendment, which would enhance, rather than inhibit, Government policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sympathetic to the reasoning behind the amendment. I am sure that the whole Committee agrees that it is important to ensure that exclusion from school does not mean exclusion from education. Schools do not lose responsibility for pupils who remain on their roll but are not currently attending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, however, goes too far in the practical burden it would place on schools. For a school itself to meet fully the educational needs of each individual excluded pupil, which in most cases would presumably mean individual tuition at home, would be extremely difficult—not to mention expensive—to arrange, all the more so if the pupil had special educational needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is also flawed in that, as drafted, it would apply not just to pupils on a fixed-period exclusion but to permanently excluded pupils who were no longer on the school roll, although I do not want to make that the reason for arguing against the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unrealistic to expect schools to continue to educate pupils excluded for any significant period. It is much more appropriate in those circumstances for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>459</span>
LEAs, rather than individual schools, to take responsibility for ensuring that suitable education is provided. That is why, in the Education Act 1993, we placed for the first time ever a statutory duty on LEAs to arrange for suitable education to be provided for pupils who would not otherwise receive it by reason of exclusion or otherwise. That duty, now carried forward to section 19 of the Education Act 1996, as the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) said, applies in the cases both of pupils who have been permanently excluded and of those excluded for a fixed period. The amendment would, therefore, conflict with the existing statutory duty on LEAs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an honest difference of view between us on the matter. I understand the rationale behind the argument of the hon. Member for Walton that schools should have the duty to educate pupils whom they have excluded, but we believe that that duty belongs to the LEA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are trying to make a distinction between temporary exclusion and permanent exclusion, as I am sure the Minister understands. There is no argument about those who are permanently excluded, but people who take decisions in schools on temporary exclusions, with all that that implies, have at least a moral obligation to provide continuing education until the problems, which might be school centred, are resolved. Why unnecessarily shift that burden onto the LEA, which has no immediate locus in the decision that effected the temporary exclusion in the first instance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right: the school makes the decision, but the duty in law lies and will remain with the LEA, which has the facilities and expertise to deal with pupils who are out of school, and has a continuing responsibility for them. Although the hon. Gentleman stresses the temporary nature of such exclusions, under the provisions of the Bill—if they survive the parliamentary process—temporary exclusions could extend to 45 days continuously. That would be a considerable burden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister reflect on what he is telling the hon. Member for Walton? Conservative and Opposition Members want to reduce the number of exclusions, whether permanent or temporary. We all know the vast majority of children who are excluded find it difficult to get back into mainstream education, and want to find ways to encourage schools to deal with bahavioural problems in school, if possible, as that is more appopriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister also to reflect on the Department for Education and Employment's recent announcement on the teachers' superannuation scheme. The Government have argued that the people who determine the add-on benefits for teachers should also take the decisions on whether teachers take early retirement. Surely the same argument applies to what the hon. Member for Walton said. Those who take the
	<span class='label label-info column'>460</span>
decision to exclude a child must have a continuing and financial responsibility for that child. Does not the Minister agree that that would produce consistency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very tempted by the hon. Gentleman's suggestion. In fact, I shall let him into a little secret. I have argued for some years in the Department for what I call the multiple principle—that is, when a school permanently excludes a pupil, it should lose a multiple of that pupil's head money. That would concentrate minds rather interestingly, and it would make that money available to whoever had to make provision for that pupil's education. I am arguing that the LEA should make that provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not yet persuaded many people of the sense of that principle. If my memory serves me right, we floated that idea in consultation some years ago, but it did not receive widespread support. However, I am not disagreeing with the principle behind what the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said. I am saying that we beleive that most schools—as usual, this applies more to smaller schools than to larger ones—do not have the ability, the facilities or the experience to make provisions such as those suggested in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, unless we were to change the thrust of our policy and legislation heretofore, which the amendment would not do adequately, we would be shifting the burden away from LEAs, where it has rested and continues to rest, towards schools. I am not yet convinced that that would be proper or practical, despite the tempting argument of the hon. Member for Bath.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As has been said many times, many of us have served on Committees considering education Bills for several years. We are not necessarily talking about who provides the service, but about who is responsible for ensuring that a service is provided to a child. A few years ago, the Minister argued strenuously about who should provide services to schools. He argued that individual schools could not necessarily provide their own services, so they should buy them in. The LEA could provide that service, as it might be providing it to several other schools, but the responsibility for ensuring that provision is made and funded should lie with the individual school. That is the logic behind what the hon. Member for Walton has said, and it is the logic behind everything that the Minister has told us about local management of schools in debates on all previous Bills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But not here, for the reason that I am trying to—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Help is at hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee are always mystified by this process; it is very straightforward.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Mrs. Forth says ring home."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish it did say that. It says here that a better analogy is special educational needs—LEAs provide funding for statements. That is the end of the matter, is it not, and I am most grateful for that better analogy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view is that the statutory responsibility for education, otherwise than at school historically lies with local education authorities. That is where that responsibility lies. Money is given to LEAs for that purpose; that should be clear. Of course, I am not suggesting that having made the difficult decision to exclude a pupil, a school should then wash its hands of that pupil. Of course a responsible school would not do that. Nor do I suggest that schools should not liaise closely with the LEA, which has the responsibility to ensure that the child is educated while not in school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, explicitly to transfer the responsibility in statute away from the LEA to the school—as is being suggested—with all the implications that that would have for the school, such as the organisational impact, the cost and so on, would run against all that we have so far said about LEA responsibilities, and would carry with it unacceptable risks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will forgive me if I take a contrary view. It appears to me that he is going against everything that the Government have so far said. I am struck by his Pauline conversion to the virtues of local education authorities. What does he have to say about schools in which expulsion is treated almost as a way of maintaining academic rigour, not as a response to disciplinary offences? There are allegations galore of such action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. EDWARD O'HARA 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>Let us take a hypothetical situation in which a school has purged itself of those that it feels will damage its position in the league tables. Does the Minister honestly believe that the subjects of that purge ought to be foisted upon the local education authority, rather than upon those most intimately responsible?</p>
	<p>I am quite encouraged by what the Minister called the multiple principle. It is eminently sensible, and in line with the Labour party paper, "Diversity and Excellence", which is predicated on the notion that schools run schools. If the Minister believes that schools should run themselves, why does he not encourage them to take on responsibility?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely grateful to the hon. Gentleman; I am given new heart by what he and the hon. Member for Bath have said. I will reconsider the matter; I will take it out, dust it off and have another look at it. I thought that what I considered to be rather a good idea of mine years ago had died; we went through all sorts of processes, but it did not appear to have got anywhere. I will consider the idea again, because it would provide a bridge between what the hon. Gentleman has argued in moving the amendment and what I am arguing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>462</span>
On the point about exclusions, which is a fair one, I have never quite been able to decide whether the average parent when considering different schools will be impressed with or depressed by—attracted to or put off—a school that has a high level of exclusions. It can be argued both ways: people can say either, "This is a tough school that gets rid of all the trouble makers, leaving only the good pupils" or, "This school has no grip at all. What kind of teachers and head teacher does a school have that resorts to that level of exclusions?" I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman shares my dilemma. I have never quite been able to make up my mind as to how parents are likely to react to different schools. I suppose they will, as ever, react in different ways so I am not sure that a ready conclusion can be drawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister on that as a parent and as an outside observer of schools in which I have no personal interest. However, we are talking about the perception of individual schools and their head teachers who sometimes take on roles in terms of exclusion which are at variance with what the Minister and I might see as being the proper prosecution of exclusion cases. It is important to have cross-party agreement on how to pre-empt unnecessary exclusions. It the Minister is saying that there are ways within funding mechanisms to pre-empt the disproportionate cost involved in exclusions, the Opposition would support them in view of the money that would be saved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that. I may not have persuaded the Opposition of my resistance to the amendment, which I shall ask the Committee to reject, but I undertake to consider seriously and urgently the possibility of reviving the idea of what I call multiples. I say that because of the encouragement of Opposition Members and what I hope is the acquiescence of my hon. Friends—silent though they may be. It might be a way of resolving the dilemma that we have identified. On that basis, I ask the Committee not to accept the hon. Gentleman's amendment because we shall return to the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very brief. I did not want to intervene yet again, but in view of the Minister's remarks, I thought it appropriate to put on record my support for the Minister's approach, which he says is his personally preferred one. It will be very helpful to have all-party agreement on the issue, so that progress can be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is critical to recognise that we are trying to do two things. First, we are trying to ensure that there is an appropriate exclusion mechanism, which is properly funded and which allows for suitable arrrangements to me made. Secondly, we must ensure that the educational provision for the excluded child continues, not least because all the evidence shows that if that does not happen, the chances are that the child will not come back into mainstream education. Therefore, as well as considering the funding mechanism, we must ensure that it will allow for high-quality educational provision.

	<span class='label label-info column'>463</span>
I am not yet convinced that the comments of the hon. Member for Walton are incorrect in any way. He is saying that, sadly, there are cases of schools excluding children when it would have been far better to resolve the discipline problem within the school. We need to take account of such schools. For once perhaps, the whole Committee will agree with the chief inspector of schools who said that some schools are "trigger happy" on exclusions. We know from research by the Commission for Racial Equality that there are some worrying trends in that Afro-Caribbean children are more likely than white children to be excluded for the same offence. Until we can be clear why that happens, it is inappropriate to allow schools to make the decision to exclude while someone else picks up the tab and the responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By combining the two factors, as proposed in the amendment and acknowledged by the Minister as a sensible approach, there is a positive way forward for the Committee to introduce into the Bill a measure that will have all-party support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was taken by the comparison drawn by the hon. Member for Bath with the letters that we have received only today about the arrangements governing the teacher's superannuation scheme. It is eminently sensible to take some lessons from that. I am also taken with the Minister's pragmatic stance—he is not noted for pragmatism in this place, but has exhibited that rare quality this morning. In the light of his comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 180, in page 21, line 10, and end insert—

	<li>to indentifying steps which can be taken by the school, parents or pupil to prevent reoccurence of that behaviour.'</li>
</ol></ol></p></blockquote>
An outbreak of Christmas spirit has been demonstrated by the amount of agreement achieved by the Committee and I hope that our sensible amendment can carry that further. The amendment would ensure that the proposed power to exclude a pupil for almost a whole term, for the sake of other pupils, teachers and the school in general, is not exercised at the expense of the child concerned. Members of the Committee will know that several months before the Bill was published, my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) raised the question of limiting the exclusion period to
	<span class='label label-info column'>464</span>
one term in any school. The clause proposes a maximum period of two or three weeks short of a term, depending on when a term starts and the school calendar of a particular year, but my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside also emphasised the importance of not simply abandoning the excluded to their fate. Although it is a fairly simple clause, the proposed change in the maxmimum period from three lots of three weeks to one period of nine weeks needs modification. We believe that our proposed subsections (3) and (4) will help the future education of an excluded child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment stresses the imperative of securing the return to the same school of pupils who have been excluded for a fixed period. At present, only 15 per cent. of children excluded from secondary schools return to mainstream education of any kind, while the figure for primary school pupils is 27 per cent. Giving a head teacher leeway to exclude a child for up to 45 days allows the adoption of a halfway house between the current 15 days in a fixed-term exclusion and the permanent exclusion of a child into a referral unit. We are not necessarily criticising referral units—although Ofsted recently found that second-class teaching is the norm in some—and assume that referral units will be in, or will be put in, a position to meet a child's educational needs. Referral to such units must be with the express and overriding objective of reintegration and must involve the organised back-up from parents that referral units seek. Support should be elicited from parents, rather than alienating them through the prospect of children roaming around at home or, worse, on the streets. It is in that spirit that our amendment emphasises the importance of the head teacher consulting with the pupil and his or her parents, as well as teachers, to identify potential special educational needs, to assess the causes of exclusion and to take steps to prevent its possible recurrence. Those measures further highlight the need to ensure that exclusion for the sake of the school does not mean that the future of an excluded child is de facto written off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that the Minister will prepare guidance to accompany the Bill. We believe that the measures should be contained in regulations, not guidance, so that clear indications are given of what a school should be doing during a fixed-term exclusion. The Minister recognises that that would be a change from current procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ofsted report on exclusions from secondary schools commented that exclusion had been used by some schools on such a regular basis that pupils lost all sense of its seriousness, regarding it as equivalent to a holiday. That highlights the extent to which exclusions merely move the problem on; schools should tackle the problem head on by involving, rather than isolating, the excluded pupil. If we can agree that exclusion alone is no panacea, surely we can also agree that, where there is no other short-term option, exclusion must be accompanied by planned, concerted measures to return the child to the school in the medium term. It is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0355">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>465</span>
a great mistake to imagine that the increased use of exclusions is evidence that there are children who must permanently be put beyond the educational pale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The findings of the Ofsted report, which was published this year, support the view that the current moral panic over exclusion—highlighted by the media coverage of the Ridings school, among others—is misplaced. None the less, there has been a significant increase in the number of exclusions nationally: the Department's figures show that the numbers have increased from 2,910 in 1990–91 to 13,581 in 1995–96.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That figure is oft referred to, but has the hon. Gentleman ever considered it in a national context? The 13,000 or so exclusions look different in the context of the fact that there are some 24,000 state schools and 7 million pupils—there is on average half an exclusion per school per year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may look a little different in that context, but, in 1995–96, 82 per cent. of exclusions occurred in secondary schools—that amounts to one in every 240 pupils. I am not saying that that amounts to many in the context of an average-sized school, but one in 240 is a significant percentage when one considers the other factors that can be taken into account. I do not have the all the figures, but the proportion is greater in secondary schools, especially for boys—81 per cent. of those excluded are boys and 19 per cent. are girls. I accept that the number of exclusions per school is not many, but I am sure that the Minister would not want to ignore the Ofsted study's finding that some schools have found exclusion too convenient a way of moving on their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside was right to say that the number of exclusions is spiralling. There was an 11.4 per cent. rise between 1993–94 and 1994–95 and a further rise of 9 per cent. between 1994–95 and 1995–96. That is a large number. Media attention makes it seem that exclusion is used to a rather greater extent. I am not saying that schools do not consider seriously what they are doing. We have already agreed that it is an alarming cost; and the Minister has said that he will consider the way forward. However, we should not dismiss what is happening; it can be measured in numbers of pupils per school per term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ofsted report observed that schools can do much within the present statutory framework to promote better behaviour and to avoid exclusion. Attention was drawn in the Ofsted report and in other reports to the disproportionate number of Afro-Caribbean pupils who are excluded. Ofsted found that the case histories of excluded Afro-Caribbean pupils were markedly different from others who had been excluded. Like their peers, those Afro-Caribbean pupils who had been excluded were found to be of average or above average ability, but they were assessed as being underachievers. If that is so, the education system has failed to motivate those pupils.
	<span class='label label-info column'>466</span>
Their disruptive behaviour was found not to be longstanding or caused by some deep-seated trauma; it was clear that they were capable of being rescued by their own schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ofsted report found that, in common with the majority of excluded pupils, the Afro-Caribbean pupils could not be managed within the school. Ofsted supports the common-sense notion that good teaching is an important means of minimising disruptive pupils but that it is far from being a cure-all. The report states that schools can work directly on behavioural problems in many ways to reduce the incidence of exclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unsurprisingly—at least to some members of the Committee—the Ofsted report also found that although the onus is on the schools to deal with pupil behaviour, local education authorities have an important part to play in disseminating good practice, collating and analysing information, communicating, and promoting and maintaining effective support services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes proposed in the amendment are sensible. In suggesting that the head teacher should
	<br><blockquote><p>"take steps to secure that a pupil who has been excluded for a fixed period returns to the school as quickly as possible",</p></blockquote>
we are attempting to get that pupil dealt with within the school. The number who return to the original school after an exclusion is appalling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context, I draw attention to the recent Audit Commission report, "Misspent Youth", on youth crime. It points out that 42 per cent. of offenders of school age sentenced in the youth court have been excluded from school and, conversely, that 78 per cent. of those permanently excluded and 31 per cent. of those temporarily excluded had committed offences. The Home Office research unit also identified school exclusions, including temporary exclusions, as one of the four main factors that characterise young offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are particular reasons for schools not simply to be put under guidance for pupils to return to school as rapidly as possible. They should be under an obligation to attempt to do so in specific ways. In some instances, for pupils of Afro-Caribbean origin, there is a need to assess or reassess whether excluded children have special educational needs. Many of their needs can be met by the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than half of the case studies showed that excluded pupils had literacy problems, which were undetected, detected too late or were not judged significant enough to warrant the additional expenditure that comes with statementing. Most support given to pupils was found to be reactive, disciplinary and seldom linked sufficiently to learning. Ofsted rightly observed that support should be based on a diagnosis of a pupil's learning difficulties. It is right that we include in the Bill a provision whereby the special educational needs of the excluded pupil are assessed or reassessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0356">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>467</span>
Meetings should take place with the school, the parents and the pupil to discuss the causes of the behaviour that gave rise to the exclusion. I am sure that, in many cases, the causes will be well known, but it is important to bring home to the pupils the seriousness of their position. A proper analysis should take place of what steps can be taken by the school, the parents and the children to prevent the recurrence of that behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may consider the amendment to be prescriptive and unnecessary but it is important that the fixed-period exclusion should be as brief as possible. It does not have to take the form of the original exclusion, which was originally pronounced as a light sentence. We want to ensure that the exclusion period can be reduced to enable the child to return to school as rapidly as possible. It is important that steps are taken jointly by the parent and the school to assess the real needs of the children to find out whether they understand fully why they have been excluded. Measures should be discussed to try to prevent a recurrence of such behaviour. The amendment is sensible and I hope that the Minister will respond positively to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that there may be occasions when a head teacher, having excluded a pupil for a fixed period, may find that the pupil is ready to return to school before that period is completed. In the majority of cases, however, the punishment of a fixed-term exclusion should be exactly that. I doubt whether commuting the sentence would be appropriate in many cases. Nevertheless, I agree that there may be circumstances when an early return is justified and we shall include advice on that in the new guidance that the Department will need to issue to schools on exclusions. No pupil should be out of school longer than is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The actions to be taken by head teachers during a fixed-period exclusion are also, I argue, best left to guidance rather than being prescribed in regulations. Head teachers will be best placed to judge what should be done on a case-by-case basis, bearing in mind the circumstances of the exclusion, any problems underlying individual pupil's behaviour and the length of the exclusion. We intend to put into guidance relevant factors for head teachers to consider. Among other things, they will cover the specific points raised by the amendment regarding pupils with special educational needs and the involvement of the pupil's parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Head teachers are already required under section 157 of the Education Act 1996 to notify local education authorities when a pupil is excluded for a total of more than five days in any one term. We do not intend to change that. LEAs are also responsible for the assessment of special educational needs so that they can make the connection where that seems appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also point out the relevance of clause 26 which would require LEAs to produce behaviour support plans. One of our intentions is that those plans should set out when a school might trigger the involvement of LEA support services and what procedures would then
	<span class='label label-info column'>468</span>
be followed. I can envisage that schools may want to draw on those services in the case of some pupils who are subject to a fixed-period exclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) of the amendment sits rather uncomfortably with subsection (3). In some cases there may be a connection between the assessment of special needs and meetings with parents and securing the return of an excluded pupil to school as soon as possible. However, it seems that that link will rarely be very direct, and often tenuous or non-existent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, our perspective is different from that of the Opposition. The hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) wants to put great detail in the Bill—set it in concrete, to be perused and admired by everyone for a long time. As we have said repeatedly, our approach is to put such measures in guidance after consultation—a process that allows us to get closer to the solutions—and to build in the flexibility that goes with guidance rather than setting the measures in statutory stone, which would make them difficult to change should they turn out to be inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the existing provisions, the measures in the Bill and the guidance following consultation will be more than adequate to cover the important points that he raised. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little disappointed by the Minister's view that the measures should be solely a matter for guidance. It is not possible to take the view both that once a term has been fixed it should be completed, and that one should try to get children back into school as rapidly as possible. Although I am not unhappy with the fixed period of three weeks, we believe that in many cases a remission might be suitable, if the attitude of the parents, the pupil or the school are favourable and one can see a constructive way to a pupil returning to school. One must assume that exclusion is intended to give a jolt to pupils to allow them to reconsider their behaviour; not all children would display signs during the exclusion that would give confidence that things would be different on their return to school, but that is not always the case and schools should be obliged to consider the possibility of remission. It is not sufficient for that to exist solely in guidance, although I understand the Minister's view—which is no different from what I had anticipated. While I recognise that we must consider as a whole the clauses on exclusion—we shall return to the issue of special educational needs—it is important to point out in regard to the clause that pupils and parents should not be isolated during an exclusion period. There should be attempts to assess constructively what might be done. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us what issues the guidance will cover and what suggestions it might offer to head teachers on how to conduct exclusion periods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer, as I said earlier, is that the guidance would cover the sort of areas covered by the hon. Gentleman in his amendment and supporting argument. As ever, I have to be slightly careful. Every time I say that we shall consult on the guidance, Opposition Members try to draw me on what the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>469</span>
guidance will say and I find myself in a rather difficult position. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there is not a problem. We acknowledge the fact that there is some difficulty and that guidance is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure that in the consultation process we establish what head teachers and others see as important, and we shall respond to that by giving them a framework in which to make the necessary and rather difficult decisions involved. As the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South pointed out, we need to strike a balance between the element of punishment in exclusion and the desire to bring the pupil back into education as quickly as possible. If anything, the difference is between the hon. Gentleman's understandable desire to see as much as possible written in statute and our long-standing unwillingness to do that because of our preference to have the greater flexibility that guidance gives us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply. I do not think that there is a great deal of difference between us, only the extent to which we feel we should be prescriptive about exclusions. The Ofsted survey on exclusions has produced valuable information, and our amendment is based on some of its recommendations on good practice in schools. I imagine that the Minister and his Department will consider that survey when drawing up the guidance for schools, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 24 refers to reinstatement appeals, and amendment No. 199 proposes that the pupil should also be present when the parent is the appellant. We must remember that 82 per cent. of exclusions are from secondary schools, so pupils can well understand the process. Perhaps it was an omission on the part of the Minister's officials when the Bill was drafted because it is unfair that pupils are not entitled to attend their own exclusion hearings. Pupils need to understand the reason for their
	<span class='label label-info column'>470</span>
exclusion, and I should have thought that an appeal hearing would draw a pupil's attention to the seriousness of his offence. The pupil could be a source of information to the appeal panel on the causes of his behaviour, so it is important for him to be present. We are not suggesting that pupils should be forced to attend hearings; of course, the provision could apply to younger children and parents may decide that they should not be present. However, they should have the opportunity to attend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mrs. Cheryl Gillan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South had to say about the amendments, and I have some sympathy with the points that he made. It is right, at least in some circumstances, that an excluded pupil under 18 should be able to attend an independent exclusion appeal hearing on his case and to speak at that hearing. I am not sure that the interests of the parents and the pupil will necessarily always be identical, and it may be that the pupil will have useful information to offer to the committee that parents will not be able to provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, there would be difficulties involved in giving an unconstrained right to every excluded pupil—whatever his or her age and maturity—to appear and make representations separately from the parents. What is appropriate may well depend on the individual circumstances of the case and of the pupil concerned. It may generally make more sense for older pupils to appear, but be inappropriate for much younger pupils to do so, but that will not invariably be the case. Therefore, someone will need to make a judgment in the light of the particular circumstances. Generally, the pupil's parents will be best placed to make that judgment, but there are also arguments that discretion should rest with the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some interesting questions about double banking are also raised. Should the pupil have the right to make representations in addition to or instead of those made by his or her parents? Should the pupil have a separate right to be represented or accompanied by a friend, in addition to the parents' right to be accompanied by a friend or representative?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman has raised those issues, and would certainly welcome his further views—and those of other members of the Committee—on the subsidiary questions that I have mentioned. If the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment, I will further consider the matter and return to it on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 187 rightly replicates the provison for grant-maintained schools that allows grant-maintained head teachers to appear and make written and oral representations at independent exclusion appeal committees. It is of course absolutely right to bring into line the arrangements for LEA and grant-maintained schools. However, I have been advised that the amendment would introduce a superfluous
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>471</span>
comma, and I would therefore be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would also withdraw that amendment. I can give him a firm assurance that I will bring forward an amendment on Report to effect the change that he has correctly identified as necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that reply; and I shall withdraw the amendment. As I said, it is important that the pupil should be heard. In criminal proceedings or care proceedings a child old enough to understand those proceedings would be present. I understand why the Under-Secretary wants the wording to have been thoroughly checked. I did not refer to the head teacher being able to be present to make representations, but I am glad that she agrees that that is necessary, because it is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we included one comma more than necessary, that is clearly due to the Opposition's lack of experience in the use of commas in drafting legislation after nearly 20 years. Given the presence of a few headmasters among our number, we should be able to get things grammatically correct. That said, it is important that pupils have the opportunity to be present and that head teachers have the opportunity to make representations. I thank the Minister for her response, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 165, in
	<br><blockquote><p>page 21, line 42, after second 'and', insert 'also to the safety of'.</p></blockquote>
Again, we are attempting to make staff safety a factor. It is interesting that staff safety was regarded as a factor in an appeal, which has gained notoriety in my constituency, on the exclusion of a young child. I shall comment on that case in later debates. Staff safety was regarded as a factor because that child was excluded on health and safety grounds—that he had a habit of biting staff or other pupils. That was regarded as a health and safety issue as well as an educational matter. Teaching can be a dangerous profession under certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the vagaries of the term "interests of" teachers that should influence whether pupils win their appeals against exclusion, but the safety of teachers. To say other than the latter would suggest that it is not the interests of pupils—either excluded or nonexcluded—that are paramount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the clause is another example of sloppy wording which needs to be fine tuned, and that the Under-Secretary has not had an opportunity to strike out the words that need to be changed. The clause will encourage some schools to wash their hands of a difficult child and allow them to give fairly thin excuses and justifications as to why it is not in the teachers' interests to teach him or her. The prejudice of a teacher or the disinclination of a school to teach a pupil might therefore, win out over the right of that child to be taught in a certain school. Staff safety must be considered. Appeal committees must be properly guided to consider issues that are pertinent to balancing the good of the school with the good of the pupil who faces exclusion, and the amendment would assist them in doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>472</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I have listened carefully to the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South. I have sympathy with his aims and objectives in this debate. However, the amendment would introduce an unnecessary requirement. Clause 24 will require an independent appeal committee, when considering whether to reinstate an excluded pupil, to have regard both to the interests of that pupil and to those of other pupils at his school and members of its staff. Therefore, the appeal committee must take account of the interests of members of staff at the school that has excluded the pupil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interests of members of the school's staff will necessarily involve their safety. However, it is better to include in the clause a broad term, such as "the interests of" members of staff, rather than the narrow term "safety of", for the simple reason that not all exclusion appeals arise from incidents of violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the safety of members of staff will not always be in question when the reinstatement of a pupil is being considered, but it will always be appropriate for an appeal committee to have regard to the broader interests of school staff. The amendment could mean that appeal committees might not consider the interests of staff members other than those related to their safety, so I ask the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Under-Secretary is unwilling to reconsider this matter. Teachers are expected to work professionally; they cannot exercise a veto on any pupil whom they do not want to teach. Can the Minister say whether separate guidance will be issued to those who serve on appeal committees, so that they can judge which teachers' interests should properly be taken into account? I am concerned that the clause as drafted is too open.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that guidance will be issued on that subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins (South-East Staffordshire)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While listening to the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Leeds, South, I was struck by the fact that the appeal committee will have to perform a balancing trick. It will have to balance the interests of the pupil, the staff, other pupils and the school as an entity. The financial pressures on each school are such that the committee will have to put the budget first, but we are trying to ensure that the safety aspects be considered first. I am talking not about psychological damage, but about actual physical damage inflicted on members of staff on a weekly basis. Employers should take that into account, and I hope that the Minister, too, will take it on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. Although there may not be many incidents of physical assaults on staff, the level varies from school to school, and some schools can be dangerous places in which to teach. I am sure that the

	<span class='label label-info column'>473</span>
Minister will agree that an appeal committee would be well aware of questions of physical assault and staff safety and would take them into account. We want safety to be specifically mentioned in the Bill, as it is difficult to envisage other circumstances—I am not talking about teachers simply not wanting to teach a child—in which teachers would have genuine concerns that would lead them to want a child excluded.

	<p>11.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. O'Hara. Amendment No. 177 would ensure that there is a sensible connection between the disciplinary policies adopted by schools and the support plan of the relevant LEA. Clause 20, which we debated and accepted in our previous sitting, introduces a new duty for school governors to develop a policy setting out a framework for discipline within the school and for head teachers to plan their disciplinary strategy within the governors' policy. Clause 26, which we are now debating, places a duty on the LEA to review and consult on its plans for supporting schools in the exercise of good discipline and to set out its arrangements for excluded pupils. It is clearly a matter of common sense that the plans and policies of the schools and the LEAs should dovetail to ensure consistent and coherent arrangements for the whole area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for such consistent and coherent arrangements to operate between the authority and each of its maintained schools. That could be more difficult to achieve if the demands made on the authority by different schools conflict with each other. It is also desirable that within a given area, there is some consistency in the approach of different schools. In my constituency, all the secondry schools got together to discuss their concerns about drugs, and they decided that it was sensible for all the schools to have a consistent policy on the problems with drugs. It was possible for the schools to work together to develop a consistent policy so that the school population in Bath knows exactly where it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right and proper that each governing body has control over its own policy. No one is disputing that. The proposed legislation requires governing bodies to have regard for the guidance that will be issued by the Secretary of State. It should also be incumbent on the governing bodies to take account of the policies of neighbouring schools and to develop their policies in the light of the support plans that the Bill requires the LEA to develop. The amendment builds on the idea of guidance being issued by the authority to schools in its area, in pursuance of the school's own responsibility. It is a requirement that encourages schools and LEAs to work together. I hope that the Minister will see the amendment as a sensible and simple addition to the Bill and I look forward to his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other amendments, which have been grouped with mine, will add a further benefit to the Bill. We look forward to the hon. Member for Walton speaking to those briefly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Bath, with his usual prescience, said, I shall be speaking to the amendments in my name and the names of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would ensure consistency between policies for supporting schools on disciplinary issues and meeting special educational needs. Proposed subsection (3) provides that the required statement on arrangements for supporting good behaviour and discipline should take account of the "interaction"—a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>475</span>
nice word—between the arrangements for such pupils and the authority's policies on pupils with special educational needs that arise from behavioural difficulties. To take account of an interaction is a weak requirement. It recognises that there is a connection between pupils identified as having special educational needs associated with behavioural difficulties and disciplinary problems arising from a similar cause, and implies that there should be some consistency of practice between the treatment of individuals who come to the attention of the authority by different routes, but it does not go much further than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would focus the proposed LEA plans in regard to children with behavioural difficulties on two important principles. First, they would require the LEA to give priority to keeping such children in mainstream schools and secondly, they would require the plans to be part of a more coherent overall strategy for children in the area, notably children's services plans initiated by the social services department of the area. I believe that the Government support both principles so they should be receptive to the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Behavioural difficulties that affect schooling are included in the current legal definition of special educational needs, but that is often overlooked. Section 316 of the 1996 Act provides that LEAs must ensure that children are educated in ordinary—that is, mainstream—schools if doing so means that they receive the special educational provision they need, that the education of other children in the school is not adversely affected and that such provision constitutes an efficient use of resources. Although LEAs are already under that legal duty, it remains important to amend the Bill for two principal reasons. First, there is a tendency to segregate children with special needs for financial reasons alone—I know that the Minister is acutely aware that places in special schools are often filled because they exist, not because of an educational imperative—and secondly, there is a need to coordinate LEA plans for behaviourally maladjusted children with plans of other agencies; social services departments are an obvious example. Although we make a lot of noise about it in Parliament, LEAs are under no requirement to plan for greater integration of children with special needs. The number of places in special schools rose in the 1980s and 1990s, and there has been a marked increase in the number of segregated schools for children with emotional or behavioural difficulties, particularly in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The HMI-Audit Commission study of provisions for pupils with special educational needs, "Getting in on the Act", shows that many more parents wanted to transfer their children from special schools to ordinary schools than vice versa. The National Children's Bureau study of children in residential schools for those with emotional and behavioural difficulties also confirmed that most parents felt that such schools had failed to meet their children's needs and that they would have preferred mainstream schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>476</span>
The Audit Commission has pointed out that there is a financial disincentive for LEAs to transfer children from special schools to ordinary schools because the authorities have to continue to fund the empty special school places. For the same reason, there is little impetus for special schools to encourage the integration of children into the mainstream sector because any reduction in pupil numbers may be a factor in reducing such schools' viability. However, as the Minister knows, many special schools encourage an overlap and partnership with the local mainstream school and offer a full spectrum of arrangements. Some children may spend one or two days in a special school and the other days of the week in a mainstream school—or vice versa. Nevertheless, there is a built-in disincentive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than half the head teachers of ordinary schools interviewed by the Audit Commission complained that their school-managed budgets were inadequate to provide for pupils with special needs. However, HMI and the Audit Commission found that, on average, it is no more expensive to educate a child with learning difficulties in an ordinary school than in a special school. The Government have endorsed the principle that such children should be intergrated whenever possible. In many cases, that will be financially viable only when special school places are reduced in number. That is particularly true for children who have behavioural difficulties because of the market pressure on mainstream schools to rid themselves of such children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paradox is that parents of children with true emotional and behavioural difficulties have tremendous problems in finding places. Some are fortunate enough to find places in excellent schools, such as the Mulberry Bush school in Abingdon. Much to my horror, however, I discovered that although that school has a long waiting list of local authorities wanting to place children there, the cost of residential primary places for children with EBD is more than £48,000 a year. That is a huge drain on resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that LEA plans for children with behavioural difficulties should relate to other plans made in the locality. I cited the example of social services department children's services plans; health authorities have a commissioning strategy for child and adolescent mental health services. The Ofsted report stressed the need for close liaison with the social services on the subject of exclusions from secondary schools, not least—a telling conclusion—because many of those excluded are, in a manner of speaking, being looked after by the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a sense, those children are doubly victimised. They are not the authors of their own misfortune, being under the care of social services for a variety of reasons. I would argue that there is a direct causal link between the state of affairs and the disproportionate number of children who are excluded from school and who thereby suffer a double whammy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 26 is generally to be welcomed, as are other Government measures to improve local planning for children. It is essential that such planning is made across all sections or it will waste resources and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0361">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>477</span>
ultimately be much less effective. After all, children may manifest very different facets of the same underlying problem to the different agencies. It seems logical that the strategies of those agencies should dovetail to achieve consistency of approach in a child-centred context. Amendments Nos. 166 and 181 facilitate that logical process and are complementary to amendment No. 177, moved by the hon. Member for Bath.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can all agree on the principle underlying the amendments. Local education authorities should, of course, ensure that their statements effectively co-ordinate the full range of services and agencies that have a role to play in tackling behaviour problems. However, that is achieved by clause 26 as it stands—"What you see is what you get."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was slightly surprised that Opposition Members should have made heavy weather of not accepting clause 26 as it is. The clause requires local education authorities to consult when preparing their plans. Those consulted will include schools, teachers' representatives, parents' representative bodies, other local services, not least social services departments, any relevant local voluntary bodies and others with general youth interests. Local education authorities will need to take account of the views of all those important local organisations before plans can be finalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause specifically requires that plans should cover the interaction between behavioural support and special educational need arrangements for pupils with behaviour problems. The Secretary of State's guidance, to which local education authorities must have regard, will cover the need for the statements to build on existing policy statements, such as children's services plans. It will also cover in detail the interaction with LEA obligations under existing special educational needs legislation as well as co-ordination with wider arrangements for children in need, such as those provided through social, health and youth justice services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would focus the Bill too closely on a small number of issues. Even though consistency with special educational needs provision, school policies and children's services plans will be important aspects of the behaviour statements, there are other aspects that LEAs will need to consider as closely and which are not, in fact, covered by the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>478</span>
Gentleman has an admirable certainty that the amendments would cover everything that could arise. The difference between us is that I do not share that certainty. I enter such processes with some trepidation and wonderment and in a questioning frame of mind, wondering what might arise as a result of talking to people who are involved in such matters. That is why the clause is deliberately worded as a framework provision within which we can issue the appropriate details through guidance. I disagree with the approach taken by the hon. Gentleman in his amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cannot the Minister understand our confusion? He referred to "others", but then said that he could not specify them. We now feel uncertain, given that he said earlier in our proceedings that there were huge areas of ignorance. He does not seem to be taking them into account when dealing with the amendments. We referred specifically to those matters which must be taken into account, but the hon. Gentleman then said other agencies needed to be taken into account. He seemed certain about that, so what are they?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You must know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware, for example, that colleagues in other Departments are working on plans and areas that are in parallel, adjacent to and connected with the Bill. Those plans have not yet come to fruition, and I am working closely with my colleagues to ensure that our work is co-ordinated properly. Until I know, for example, what proposals they will come up with, I do not wish to pre-empt, preclude or unnecessarily include them in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the legislative process on which we are embarked is unlikely to be concluded before spring of next year, I do not share the hon. Gentleman's prescience or confidence in saying that the amendment covers every conceivable issue so it must be put into the Bill. I do not know with certainty the sort of areas that we might want to encompass and I prefer to leave the clause as a framework provision within which to put guidance following consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing mysterious about the clause. It is becoming obvious that there is no difference between our and the Committee's desire to ensure that all the services interlock and interact properly. The difference between the hon. Gentleman and myself is that, while the amendment would pre-empt that co-ordination and nail the clause down tightly now, I want to leave some "wiggle" room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not arguing about the principle of co-ordination. We agree about that. I just find it alarming that there are other agencies to which we must refer. We would take those agencies that have an interest into account. I take it as read that, if any agencies of which the Minister is not aware and to which we have made no reference had an interest, they should be consulted anyway. The principle is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0362">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>479</span>
established that consultation ought to take place, and we should have more than the weak word "interaction", which is used in clause 26(3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is more agreement between us than I thought. As the hon. Gentleman is in danger of getting hung up on that point, and as I have now received advice, I will give him an example—only one example from my list for the moment because I do not want to show my whole hand at this stage. [HON. MEMBERS: "It is a very short list."] It may be a short list, but I am still not going to share it in its entirety with the Committee at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One example is educational psychology services. The impression may be given that the amendments are all-embracing and all-inclusive—although the hon. Member for Walton interestingly and, typically, honestly said that there may be other examples that have not been mentioned. We should set out the principle of consultation and then, as the process unfolds, we shall discover the nature of all the services and interests that need to be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no attempt to conceal; the process is perfectly open. Rather than giving the impression that everything conceivable is written into the Bill by passing an amendment such as this, I would rather retain the general provisions of the clause and then—as I have argued throughout our sittings—rely on a process of consultation and development of guidance to cover all the angles. That is why I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is in a bit of difficulty because of what the Minister has just said. First, he said that there will be wide-scale consultation and, as I asked him to do, he mentioned some of the bodies that will be involved in that consultation process. But he then went on to say—as will be shown in the official record—that in drawing up its plans, the LEA will need to take account of that consultation. Unfortunately, as the Minister well knows, when consultation is undertaken on educational matters—especially consultation caried out by this Government—often very little notice is taken of it. We can all cite examples of that; no doubt the hon. Member for Walton will give us an example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not, but does the hon. Gentleman agree that given the number of consultations that the Minister has so far announced in Committee, he is in danger of being designated the Minister for consultation rather than the Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman takes my second point out of my mouth; now that it has been said, I shall not repeat it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is no attempt to ensure co-ordination of individual schools' policies with LEAs' policies, we may get into some difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will of course give way to the Minister, but before I do so to enable him to defend what he has said, I must first say that the reason why it is important
	<span class='label label-info column'>480</span>
that we ensure co-ordination between schools' policies and LEAs' policies by writing it into the Bill is that as the Minister has himself demonstrated, it is otherwise unlikely to occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister especially likes hearing his own words being quoted at him; he treats that as the ultimate form of flattery. During our previous sitting, speaking about the development of individual schools' policies and what regard they should have to LEA policies, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"And the guidance could be variable in quality. More importantly, a governing body could be faced with guidance from an LEA which conflicted with, or contradicted that from the Secretary of State. For example, an LEA might advise against the use of particular sanctions which guidance from the Secretary of State had recommended as a reasonable response to a disciplinary incident."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 12 December 1996; c. 433–4.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister told us that there was a real possibility of conflict between a school's policy and the LEA's policy; the amendment would ensure that we avoided that conflict.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much as I admire the hon. Gentleman, he seems to have lost that free-wheeling, classical liberal approach, which I should have thought he and his party wanted to represent. Surely he is not suggesting that in some heavy-handed, bureaucratic way, we must ensure that every school's policy on every issue is identical. Even on something as important as a drugs policy, which the hon. Member for Bath mentioned earlier, different schools may well want or need to have different approaches within a broadly defined framework. Surely, that is right. We must strike a balance. There is the natural desire of all bureaucracies to ensure that everybody does everything in the same way, so the Government may want to make sure that all LEAs are the same and LEAs may want to ensure that all their schools are the same, but a more traditional liberal approach would suggest that people should have the flexibility to meet their individual needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sadly, the Minister obviously did not listen to my speech in which I stressed that point. I said that I was not suggesting a single discipline policy for all schools. If the Minister reads the clause, he will recognise that there is a difference between the policies and procedures that have to be drawn up by individual schools and the purpose of the LEAs' plans. They will serve somewhat different purposes anyway. I am merely saying that when the two—the policies and the plans—interact, it would be sensible for them to dovetail in a way that will work. The Minister is fearful that they may not because of his concern—perhaps somewhat unjustified—about how some local authorities may act. The Minister is trying to have it both ways. He has failed to take note of the number of times the phrase "as may be prescribed" is written in clause 26. The Minister is saying that certain requirements will be prescribed, but if they are not written in the Bill, we do not know what they will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The new clause refers to discipline and caning in schools. It covers only those cases that otherwise might result in exclusions. It is not about beating, thrashing, flogging or any other emotive word so beloved by those who oppose corporal punishment. It is about reasonable punishment. It might be helpful to reiterate that new clause 1 refers only to those cases that otherwise would result in exclusions, and it refers only to reasonable caning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is going to great lengths to stress the idea of reasonable caning. A picture is worth a thousand words, so perhaps he could get one of his hon. Friends who agrees with him to demonstrate reasonable caning on each other. That would be very helpful to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely saddened by the poor quality of that intervention. I honestly believed that the hon. Gentleman was capable of better than that. His remarks were cheap and silly, and I hope that on reflection, he will withdraw them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a school wishes to insert in its contract with parents a clause that would allow the head or another designated teacher to cane a child, it should be allowed to do so. I stress that caning would occur only in cases of misdemeanour that would otherwise result in exclusion. In an earlier debate, the hon. Member for Bath quite properly referred to the difficulty that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>483</span>
pupils who have been excluded experience when attempting to return to school. I thought that he made a valid point, of which the Committee should take greater note.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my firm view—this has been borne out by an earlier debate—that exclusions damage children substantially, certainly more so than simply being caned. Exclusions result in those children who would have most to gain from education being put outside the school gates. That cannot be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to a parliamentary question dated 13 November, my hon. Friend the Minister advised me that the latest figures on exclusion showed that 8,870 pupils were permanently excluded from secondary schools in England in 1994–95. I was grateful to the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South for saying, as I understood him, that only 15 per cent. of those excluded return to school and, therefore, obtain the benefit of a reasonable education. In many ways, that figure underlines my case, perhaps as nothing else can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman says is interesting. In the Chamber, some of his colleagues referred to the notion of using corporal punishment as a means of last resort, but he has not done so today. He is trying to define "last resort" so that corporal punishment is used only when exclusion might otherwise occur. Is not the difficulty of that the fact that there is no strict set of conditions in which exclusion occurs? None is defined in the Bill, nor do schools normally define in detail the circumstances in which they would exclude a pupil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's notion that corporal punishment should be used where exclusion would otherwise occur is meaningless. A school would have only to say that a child would have been excluded to use corporal punishment on him or her. If there were a set of firm circumstances in which exclusions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady is beginning to make a speech, rather than an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady made a long intervention, but I am grateful to her for doing so. In one way at least, she argued my case with an eloquence that I cannot match. It is interesting to contrast the thoughtful intervention of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardly (Ms Morris) with the silly intervention of the hon. Member for Bridegend (Mr. Griffiths).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I remind the hon. Member for Yardley that last Thursday, she said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I trust head teachers to behave in a way that protects their pupils and to ensure that members of staff behave in the most professional manner."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 12 December 1996; c. 426.]</p></blockquote>
That is the very answer to the question that she has asked this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to the number of permanent exclusions. The word "permanent" is the essence of the matter. Many pupils are temporarily excluded, but I do not know how many; no figure exists. However, I believe that the number is substantial and, sadly, increasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>484</span>
I recently received a Commission for Racial Equality booklet entitled "Exclusion from Schools: The Public Cost". It maintains that one permanent exclusion, starting in 1994–95 and extending into 199596, would cost £5,134 per annum. It says that to that figure must be added the cost of the involvement of a number of other agencies. For example, 20 per cent. of permanently excluded pupils use social services, at a cost of £1,100 each; 10 per cent. use health services, at a cost of £100; 25 per cent. incur a cost to the criminal justice system of approximately £2,000 per case. That adds up to a total of £8,334.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not base my case on cost, although it is a truism that a pound can be spent only once, and a pound spent on exclusion is no longer available in the classroom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that I fundamentally disagree with his proposition. Does he have any evidence to support the main premise of his argument, which seems to be that the reintroduction of caning will reduce the use of exclusions? The main published research shows that, to the contrary, schools that resorted to a heavy use of caning also excluded a large number of children. In 1989, the Elton report stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Punitive regimes seemed to be associated with worse rather than better standards of behaviour."</p></blockquote>
Does the hon. Gentleman know of evidence to the contrary, showing that the reintroduction of caning would reduce exclusion as he suggests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I firmly believe in the policy that I am advocating. The hon. Gentleman knows—perhaps better than most—the old saying that there are lies, damned lies and statistics. That applies in this case just as it does in any other. It is my firm view that corporal punishment, if used in the nation's schools in a reasonable and caring way, would reduce the dependence on exclusions. It is also my firm belief that exclusions greatly damage children, in a way that is perhaps not clearly understood—anyone who doubts that need only recall the recent substantial debate on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Gentleman about parental consent under new clause 1? Does he accept that parents could give their consent when their child enters the school, but might change their minds and withdraw that consent? Given that that consent was a condition for the child being in the school, would not its withdrawal mean that the only disciplinary alternative would be exclusion? Would not the number of exclusions increase in those circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point, which I shall deal with as my speech progresses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an additional argument. The Committee should note what the Commission for Racial Equality said about the number of agencies and bodies that become involved in exclusions. I suggest that that shows the breadth and depth of the damage that is done to the children. According to advice that I have received, new clause 1 would not attract the attention of Europe because parents would have given permission for their children to be caned—that permission being part of the school-parent contract into which both parties freely entered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members will recall that the school-parent contract is permissive, a point that has been made repeatedly by my hon. Friends the Minister and the Under-Secretary of State. If a school does not wish to adopt the contract or, if it adopts it but does not wish to adopt the reference to corporal punishment, that is entirely a matter for the parents, the governing body and the head teacher. The new clause would simply give an additional permissive power to schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal is permissive, not prescriptive. I want merely to provide teachers with an added sanction that they might use in place of exclusions. The hon. Member for Bath said that no single policy applies to all schools. He was right. I am not saying that such a policy should apply to all schools, only to those schools that believe that it would be of material benefit to their pupils. That is the essence of the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a number of occasions, the hon. Gentleman implied that there would be less malevolent effects on pupils from the use of corporal punishment than there would be from exclusion. We agree that needless exclusion is not desirable; it has deleterious effects on individual pupils. Does not the hon. Gentleman agree also that corporal punishment would have equally deleterious effects on people who, in some instances, were completely brutalised by the experience?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that there seems to be some minor agreement between us. However, the hon. Gentleman failed to take note of the key word "reasonable". Clearly, if a head teacher is involved in reasonable punishment, the hon. Gentleman's fears will not be realised. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State expressed great worry about the growing number of early teacher retirements. I suspect that one of the reasons for that increase is the indiscipline that exists in a minority of the nation's classrooms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have long argued that the overwhelming majority of the nation's teachers are dedicated, both to their profession and to the children in their charge. They
	<span class='label label-info column'>486</span>
are, indeed, professionals—a point that was made at our previous sitting when we discussed the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw). Few teachers enter the profession to become rich. Most of them go into it because of a sense of genuine vocation and for the satisfaction that they receive from imparting knowledge. However, that satisfaction must be much reduced when faced by a disruptive, ill-disciplined or, at times, violent class.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman realise that the new clause would allow a 17-year-old girl to be caned? Will he tell us in what circumstances and on what part of the body that could take place and whether it could be carried out by a male teacher?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The plain, straight, non-political answer to the hon. Gentleman is no, I shall not tell him that because it is clearly a matter for the individual school. I say to the hon. Gentleman straight down the line that there are times when I wish I were as certain as anything as he is of everything. He was not listening when I said that the new clause is permissive and allows the school, governors, parents and teachers to resolve the matter. The hon. Gentleman's question is one for them—not for him, me or any other member of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote from a letter written to my local newspaper by a well-respected, retired English teacher who taught in a Rugby secondary school. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When I started in 1958 I occasionally caned the odd miscreant so that the class could study quietly, and listen and learn. Children knew that they were expected to behave reasonably and that there were sanctions if they did not."</p></blockquote>
That retired teacher, who had about 35 years' experience of teaching in a major secondary school environment, had it about right; members of the Committee will note his use of the word "occasionally". I believe—and this returns us to an earlier question—that the cane is a powerful deterrent and that its mere presence in a corner of the head's study is in most cases enough to ensure discipline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way as I was distracted when he last made the point about the cane being a deterrent. I wonder if he recalls the story told on Second Reading by my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe), who pointed out that it was always the same children, week after week, who were caned at the front of the class when he was at school. Rather than a deterrent, it was a status symbol for those most frequently caned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has made the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>487</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made an interesting intervention with which I shall deal later. I would just gently say to him now, while we are swapping quotations, that Lord Tebbit said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I was caned at school and I suspect that I would have been more unruly had I not been."</p></blockquote>
I was not surprised that in a recent Gallup poll more than two thirds—68 per cent.—of the public supported the return of the cane in state schools, and a similar proportion said that they would allow their own children to be caned. The survey also revealed a growing desire for a return to traditional sanctions in schools. Interestingly, support for the cane was consistent across the political spectrum. Those who oppose corporal punishment should reflect on those facts. The principal question that the Committee needs to address is that of which does greater damage—exclusions or being caned? As a parent, had I been faced with that choice, I would have had no hesitation in going for the caning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps issuing that challenge: what would we prefer, exclusion or caning? I asked him again what evidence he has that reintroducing caning would reduce the current level of exclusion, about which he is rightly concerned. He sets up a number of challenges. He says that indiscipline may be the clause of early retirement and suggests that we might have to choose between indiscipline and the reintroduction of caning. What evidence does the hon. Gentleman have that the reintroduction of caning would reduce the level of indiscipline? Finally, he sets up a challenge—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I call Mr. Pawsey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was another long intervention, but it clearly shows how interested the Committee is in ensuring discipline in the nation's schools. The hon. Member for Bath is perceptive; he goes to the nub of my arguement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. The Committee should allow schools the choice. If the policy does not work, it will not be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Teachers are unique in the United Kingdom in being asked to act in loco parentis—in place of the parent. Teachers should, therefore, act as a reasonable parent would. If firm discipline is required in the interests of learning, who can disagree? Surely all hon Members accept that learning takes place best in a reasonably disciplined environment. New clause 1 seeks only to give teachers an added sanction, allowing them to teach without too much disruption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to discipline and a disciplined environment. Does he not accept that in that context, caning may provide an
	<span class='label label-info column'>488</span>
ordered environment, but not necessarily a disciplined one? Discipline is interiorised, whereas order is imposed from the outside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point. However, I have not answered the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts), who suggested that some children might gain kudos from being regularly caned. That is not so. As an unruly lad, I was caned from time to time. Anyone who believes that one will win the respect of one's peers by being caned is crackers. It does not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try not to cover old ground because much of what should be said in response to the debate is old had and has been said ad nauseam on the Floor of the House and elsewhere. Indeed, much of what was said by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth is not worthy of a response—I say that with all humility, because I am a great parliamentary friend of the hon. Gentleman and I know that he is a genial individual. Hon. Members will have noticed that the hon. Gentleman is hyperactive. That is what has led him to support such a spatchcocked new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 1 is quite long, yet although the words "corporal punishment" appear in the first line, the clause does not define such punishment. It means bodily punishment. I do not believe in attaching nicknames to individuals, as is the wont of some hon. Members, but the hon. Gentleman deserves to be called "Flogger".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Whacker".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister suggests from a sedentary position that the name "Whacker" might be more appropriate—or even "Whacko".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth completely misunderstood how new clause 1 should have been drafted. Corporal punishment can mean anything and everything. Extensive definition would be required before people knew exactly what the law would or would not permit. Subsection (5) refers to "proportionate punishment", but what does that mean? What it means in one set of circumstances may be wholly different from what it means in another, and how individual teachers interpret it may differ from school to school and area to area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) of the new clause refers to a pupil
	<br><blockquote><p>"who has not attained the age of 18".</p></blockquote>
Let us imagine a pupil in the sixth form who may be whacked on the day before his or her 18th birthday, but not one day later. There may be a whole cross-section of people who can be whacked one day but not the next, and that would lead to a gross injustice—people in the same age range and with the same general level of maturity would be subject to different types of what the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth describes as discipline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ridiculous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0367">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>489</span>
The new clause does not contain a definition of what kind of punishment should be dished out. Should it be on the hands, the head, the backside or the feet? Who knows what combinations could be thought up? As someone who was beaten—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As with the Minister, who nods in agreement. I was beaten every day for five years by a particular teacher. My sole crime what that he took an instant dislike to me when I entered the school; he immediately ordered me to the back of the class—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Committee cannot imagine that, of course. He gave me a sound thrashing every day that he came across me. It did not endear me to that teacher or to my school, and I do not believe it helped me to have a love for education for its own sake. Instead, it led to a fear of a brutish individual, who brutalised many of my fellow pupils who were not quite as able as a sturdy soul such as myself to take the punishment that was meted out in that purely arbitrary way. The new clause does not in any way attend to those considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ask ourselves whether corporal punishment works; there is absolutely no evidence that it does. The hon. Gentleman ignores the change in attitudes and tone in our schools and the current modus operandi of people in loco parentis—if I may introduce a little Latin. Corporal punishment in the maintained sector is a feature of the past. Chaos does not reign supreme without it; there is orderly, well-structured and effective teaching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has given no thought to who would administer that punishment. He referred to the head teacher—I think that he said "master", which is very telling. I assume that he envisages that someone would be designated master for flogging. Such people, for reasons best known to themselves, would take on the onerous duty of beating boys—and presumably girls, if the measure applies to girls' schools—and get some kind of satisfaction, vicarious or otherwise, from meting out punishment on a grand scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly hope that the hon. Gentleman does not envisage a return to the practice of the Jesuits in St. Francis Xavier school in Liverpool when I was young. We were given bills, and at the end of the week had to go to the designated punishment master. It did not matter whether we had a bill for six or for 60, we took our punishment there and then and were well and truly beaten for apparent crimes that may have been committed at the beginning of the week. What were those crimes? Who is to decide what is "proportionate punishment", to use the words in the hon. Gentleman's new clause? Are people to be beaten because they get their homework wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If such a sanction were to be made available in our schools, some people would wilfully misinterpret both the hon. Gentleman's intentions and the new clause. Whether we talk about a reasonable or a proportionate response does not matter; it will be tested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Gentleman said that 68 per cent. of people were in favour of restoring corporal punishment. I am sure that if we asked may of those people whether they wanted the reintroduction of the cat-o'-nine-tails and thumbscrews, we might find that a majority of them were in favour. If we were to propose knocking down the church on Tyburn hill and reintroducing public hanging, I am sure that readers of 	<i>The Sun</i> would flock to the cause and that there would be a telephone poll that told us that that was what the public wanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always assumed that we are not here just to reflect what an opinion poll may or may not tell us in its simplistic way, but to attempt honourably to lead public opinion to what is fair, just, right and proper—especially on behalf of people who cannot speak for themselves. The children who would be subject to the kind of punishment proposed are the people least able to speak for themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to say that there may be votes in favour of all sorts of things. Is he aware that the hon. Member for Batley and Spen (Mrs. Peacock) proposed that caning should take place on national television immediately before the lottery draw? I do not know whether that was because she felt that more people would be attracted to the lottery or because she thought it a suitable punishment for those involved. When the 	<i>Yorkshire Evening Post,</i> which quite liked that idea, put it to the local public, it received a 77 per cent. vote in favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that example. We could also draw on the example of what happened in ancient Rome—I know that you, Mr O'Hara, are an expert on these matters. Before people were caned on the national lottery, they could say, "Those who are about to be flogged salute thee, Mystic Meg." That could be the clarion call of the national lottery. That shows the absurdity of the proposition of the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The moral, reasonable and educational case for throwing out such a nonsensical—I do not use that word lightly—new clause is overwhelming. It is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>491</span>
nonsensical, populist new clause which has been proposed for purely political purposes and it has nothing to do with the disciplinary or educational needs of our schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, I am sure that what the hon. Gentleman proposes violates the European convention on human rights. I recall that cases were brought by parents in the Greater Manchester area on the question of whether there was a philosophical objection to corporal punishment in schools. On those grounds, such punishment, especially if it were carried out against parental wishes, would violate article 2 of the convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may not realise that the new clause would bring the independent sector—a sector to which he is especially devoted—into a contentious area in terms of the convention. It would affect assisted places scheme pupils and others in a way that might also be in breach of articles 2 and 3 of the convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legal case against the provisions is fundamental—unless, of course, the hon. Gentleman is one of the Europhobes for whom anything to which the adjective "European" is attached is anathema. We freely and willingly signed the convention because it reinforces the rights that every individual has in any civilised society. Given what I am sure will be overwhelming opposition from both Conservative and Opposition Members, I hope that the hon. Gentleman, having made a shallow political point, will beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gravesham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The way in which to approach the new clause is neither on the basis of personal anecdote nor on a personal view that corporal punishment is rather painful and somewhat humiliating—that is a truism—but on the basis that we demand of our teachers, and especially head teachers, that they maintain an orderly and disciplined framework within which our young people can learn. We impose that duty on them, and they require sanctions to impose on youngsters so that those conditions can be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sanctions are inadequate in far too many shcools and the Government will increase those sanctions under part IV of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth has said that there should be an additional, draconian sanction available to head teachers. Any suggestion that head teachers do not have the balance or judgment to decide whether corporal punishment is relevant to an exceptional case to avoid exclusion casts doubt on their professionalism. We are talking about an additional sanction which should not have been removed in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw on my experience as a member of the Northamptonshire county council education committee when corporal punishment was considered in 1982. There was the usual parade of personal anecdotes from Labour councillors, saying how terrible and uncivilised it was to be on the receiving end of corporal punishment. That is true. However, we were sitting in an oak-panelled chamber, just as we are today, being terribly civilised in discussing such matters, but forgetting the fundamental point—
	<span class='label label-info column'>492</span>
teachers must face the adolescents who make it difficult to maintain discipline in schools. It is not up to councillors or Members of Parliament to maintain discipline or carry out the unpleasant duty of applying corporal punishment to young students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember the comments of the teachers' unions' representatives in that council chamber. They told me privately that they hoped that we would all stick to our guns because the sanction of corporal punishment was occasionally valuable when maintaining discipline. I also remember the outcome; due to political correctness, those union representatives spoke that way privately, but voted with the Labour councillors. I asked them why they did so, and they said that they had to work with a majority of Labour members and, therefore, dared not cross them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I told those representatives that they were the people who would be expected to maintain discipline, but that they had thrown away one of the principle sanctions that had enabled them to do so. As a result, increasing numbers of youngsters are excluded. What do they do? I know that it is a case of out of sight, out of mind, but those youngsters are down at shopping centres and in the streets, causing a certain amount of mayhem to local residents, the elderly and so on. That is not the way in which to maintain discipline and it is unfair to the wider community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Walton referred to the European convention on human rights. I believe that that convention was set up in the 1950s for the principal reason that eastern Europe had been overrun by communists, who were sending a succession of individuals to the gulags. People were determined to have a convention and an international court to back it up so that were France and Italy to become communist, individuals would have an avenue of redress. The convention and the European courts have ceased to face that threat, which no longer exists following the collapse of communism, yet the courts are indulging in increasingly politically correct judgments to justify their continuing existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's new clause is extremely important because it shows trust in the judgment of our head teachers and emphasises that the House expects our teachers to maintain a disciplined framework in our schools so that our youngsters can be educated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make just one small point that echoes that made by the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Arnold). The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth praised my hon. Friend the Member for Yardley for speaking of the need to respect head teachers and to rely on their judgment. Why do the hon. Member for Gravesham and his hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth persist in advocating corporal punishment when all the teachers' organisations have made it clear that they do not support it and think it an inappropriate sanction? Why, in the face of so much teacher opposition, are they still prepared to support an amendment that is contrary to what schools and their head teachers wish to stand for and practice in terms of their relationship with those they serve?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pawsey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Gentleman is very simple; the amendment is permissive. If teachers do not wish to use corporal punishment, they will not. It is for them, not for the hon. Gentleman or me, to decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian David Jenkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Leeds, South agree that one could have the situation of a chairman of the governors deciding that the school should have corporal punishment when all the teachers and the head teacher were opposed to it? Would such a school have to appoint a school child beater?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gunnell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth, the amendment may be permissive, but teachers and head teachers, having experienced many years without corporal punishment as a sanction, have recognised that its absence is positive and forces them to deal with issues without resorting to the simple expedient of the sort that the hon. Gentleman wishes to introduce. His amendment is in opposition to everything that teachers have said they stand for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a discussion about the substantial increase in the use of exclusions. That has occurred since the unfortunate abolition of corporal punishment and although one should not indulge in the fallacy of post hoc, ergo propter hoc, it cannot be a mere coincidence that there has been increased misbehaviour in schools since that important sanction was removed. The hon. Member for Walton said that my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth was indulging in a purely political manoeuvre. What he is really saying is that my hon. Friend's view is popular and that most parents and most of the electorate support it. Why does the hon. Member for Walton think that he is superior to the vast majority of the British people? He seems to think that he is better able than parents, grandparents and the country at large to judge what is good for children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
