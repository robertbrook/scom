	<p>No. 182, in page 17, line 17, leave out 'prepare' and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>', in consultation with the head teacher, adopt'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment makes sense, so I shall not spend much time on it. We all want governing bodies to take part in the writing of a code of discipline, but the clause puts an undue emphasis on the governing body writing the text. We wish the governing body to agree the text with the head teacher so that there is a common agenda. The law should not place an undue obligation on governing bodies to write the text.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would bring the clause in line with other obligations on governing bodies—for instance, their work on the curriculum and sex education. In both those instances, the law requires them to make a statement, but it does not oblige them to write the text. I am not sure why the wording is different on the matter of discipline from what it is in the two instances that I have mentioned. By no stretch of the imagination do I wish to remove the obligation on the governing body to be involved with making policy on discipline; I wish to make it clear that the governing body's obligation is to agree the policy with the head teacher and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the amendments will find favour with the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the head teacher and staff should be seen to be implementing and operating a behaviour and discipline policy with the full support of the governors. That is why we are placing a new duty on the governing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0329">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>417</span>
body to draw up, and periodically to review, a written statement of general principles upon which the head teacher will determine the school's discipline policy. By so doing, we shall increase the role of the governing body in promoting good behaviour and discipline with the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many governing bodies already do that, but that good practice needs to be disseminated more widely. Clauses 20 and 21 will ensure that every governing body determines the broad principles for the school's behaviour and discipline policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are unnecessary. It is surely implicit in the wording of new subsections 154(2) and 306A(2) that in preparing a written statement of general principles the governing body as a whole has, by a majority decision, agreed that that should be the statement to be passed on to the head teacher. The word "agree" might lead to ambiguity, as it is not clear with whom the document should be agreed—for example, would it be among the governors or with another party, such as the head teacher? We do not accept that it would be a valid objection in law to say that "prepare" means only "to make ready". I therefore urge the Committee to reject amendments Nos. 134 and 133.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for amendment No. 182, it will be important when the governing body is preparing its written statement of general principle that it should have access, as needed, to guidance on pupil behaviour and discipline. That will ensure that the governing body is as well informed as possible about those important matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to be nice. I shall give way when I have finished being nice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why clauses 20 and 21 require the governing body to have regard to any guidance given from time to time by the Secretary of State. Head teachers are a mine of useful information on behavioural and disciplinary matters; they, too, have an important role in offering guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised, however, that there is scope to improve the wording on amendment No. 182. I therefore accept in principle its underlying assumption, and shall bring forward a revised proposal on Report to secure that aim. In doing so, we shall go one step further: we will also amend clause 21 to ensure that a similar requirement is made of the governing bodies of grant-maintained schools and grant-maintained special schools to consult the head teacher. I now give way to the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

wanted to intervene so that I could ask him to explain what he thought the difference was between preparing and making a statement; and why other legislation had been treated differently. Given what the Minister said, we look forward to the Government introducing amendments on Report which we hope we shall be able to support.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue of a dress code in schools attracts much attention, because more than ever before people are looking closely at schools and thinking about how they are run in terms of both management and teaching. People are concluding that, just as in British business and industry, management might be as important in schools as teaching is in providing children with an education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that the amendments would revolutionise our schools or teaching habits, but they would help raise overall standards in the management of schools and the way in which teaching staff approach their jobs. I stress that I do not believe that they would have much impact in my constituency, which is blessed by head teachers who operate their schools to a very high standard—including a high standard of dress. The amendments would, however, allow a commonsense application in schools of what we believe is an appropriate way—an emphasis on professionalism—of teaching staff to approach their

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Through a disciplinary panel, we throw out from the profession anyone who is crooked. We have a good ethics and disciplinary process, which, as confirmed under the Financial Services Act 1986, has been very effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to suggest that teachers should mirror chartered accountants—that is not the purpose of the amendments—but I point out to the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) that I entered the profession when the training system was changing. Previously, the people who trained new chartered accountants were not necessarily qualified chartered accountants themselves, but now there is an effective branch of the profession that teaches accountancy—indeed, most of the teachers are now qualified accountants. We have been enormously effective in raising standards and in encouraging a professionalism that perhaps did not exist when I entered the profession. There has certainly been an improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following on from what my hon. Friend the Member for Walton said, can the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee whether there is any other profession for which it is thought appropriate that Parliament lay down a dress code?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference between the teaching profession and other professions is precisely the point that the Opposition were majoring on in earlier debates—that is, the public money that is spent on it. The Opposition were concerned about the use of public money then, so why are they not concerned about it now to ensure that teachers have the right professional standards and approach to their jobs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In those occupations that have a uniform or a dress code, the employer normally pays for it. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the employer—hence, the public purse— should pay in this case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly hope that teachers who become more professional—that is, those who become members of a professional body, rather than a trade union—will contemplate the fact that they will be better remunerated than those who concentrate on trade unionism, and perhaps the Government will also comtemplate that. But that is a separate debate, and I do not want to go down that path today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way later, but I want to make headway because there are pressures of time, as hon. Members will appreciate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that this debate is about helping teachers to be seen more as professionals and to gain the professional status that they would like to achieve. This is not a debate about insisting that teachers must have a sort of uniform, although it is recognised that school children have uniforms, and there is certainly a need for teachers to be well dressed even if they do not dress in uniforms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is considerable support for that idea. One of the people who supported it was the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett). In the 	<i>Sunday Times,</i> he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Tories are a few weeks behind me. I have been saying that teachers are role models and must dress respectably to set an example."</p></blockquote>
When the Opposition's shadow spokesman on education believes that teachers should dress respectably and set an example, we know that we have achieved a radical change in thinking in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we can all agree that teachers are role models. Does the hon. Gentleman have anything specific to say about a dress code, or does he want the individual head teacher to determine the dress code for his or her school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will see from the wording of the amendments, I have left it to each school and individual head teachers to determine the dress code. All sorts of circumstances might vary the dress code. For example, although I hope that jeans would not be part of a dress code, I know that dress down days are often arranged with pupils. Indeed, last week, I visited a school in my constituency on such a dress down day, and not only were the pupils in their own clothes, but the teacher of a class that I visited was dressed down as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman make it clear what he is concerned about? He has said that the schools in his constituency are well run, and that teachers dress to an acceptable standard and—to paraphrase what he said—are good role models for children. That is true in my constituency as well. [HON. MEMBERS: "And mine."] It is probably also true in many other constituencies. Has the hon. Gentleman moved the amendment because he thinks that teachers might not dress well in future, or is he concerned that some teachers are not good role models for their pupils now? If the latter is the case, will he tell us of the evidence that he accrued when deciding to table the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The evidence is well established. The hon. Lady was quite happy to quote the Sunday Times earlier this week, but cited only one example. Over the years, the 	<i>Sunday Times</i> has produced a number of examples of bad dress sense in teachers, as have several other newspapers. I accept that the standard of teachers' approach to their jobs and their standard of dress have risen enormously under this Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Jamieson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Plymouth, Devonport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a teacher were sufficiently well advised to seek accountancy advice from the hon. Gentleman when completing his tax return, and if it were set out in law that certain clothing had to be worn by teachers, could that teacher not off-set that expense against taxation? If so, are there not financial implications to the hon. Gentleman's proposal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must recognise that that would not be the case. [HON. MEMBERS: "Yes it is."] No, it is not the case. When I started as a chartered accountant, the office manual stated that we had to wear appropriate dress, but we were not allowed any deduction by the tax man.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by something that the hon. Gentleman said a few moments ago: that it would be up to the individual head teacher to ascertain what was the appropriate level of dress. If a head teacher felt it most appropriate in his school that staff wore jeans and trainers, as did all the kids, would the hon. Gentleman accept that head teacher's judgment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a head teacher, after consultation with the governors and parents—which I believe would occur—implemented such a policy, and the parents and governors were happy to go along with it, so be it. But given the direction in which people—parents and governors—are pushing education, I do not envisage a head teacher acting in that way under the amendments if passed. Parents and governors want standards raised all round. Like the headmasters in my constituency, I believe that people want there to be a high standard of dress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was intrigued to read an editorial on 5th November in 	<i>Kent Today,</i> a newspaper in my constituency, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Teachers are role models and it is important for them to show that a smart appearance often goes with a good performance.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>And they need to remind youngsters that there are few employers who will give a job to the slovenly-dressed."</p></blockquote>
It is important that teachers set a standard that their pupils can follow and can use to help them to get a job later in life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman's logic. If it is the wishes of parents that is driving forward this process, surely if parents wish staff to dress in a certain way, that is communicated to the governors, who can currently decide to require the head to require staff to do so. If that is all possible now and is driven by the views of parents and governors, why the need for the amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Indeed, that process is already effectively in operation in schools in my constituency. However, I want to encourage the raising of standards throughout the country. I want to ensure that every parent knows that there is legislation on this issue that can be enforced, and I want to encourage head teachers to operate such legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>422</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I must make some progress; I will give way later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is amply demonstrated by headmasters in my constituency, one of whom, when asked by a local journalist, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Teachers are role models and their appearance does set an example to students".</p></blockquote>
Another head teacher said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I also believe there is a correlation between a pride in appearance, good behaviour and a good work ethos. This is something we strive for"—</p></blockquote>
at the school in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people believe that there is also a correlation between appearance and the respect that teachers receive in the classroom. On 4 November, an article in 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Teaching is a profession in which respect is essential and the first step is to look the part. That is why members of other professions, such as solicitors, civil servants and doctors are expected to dress properly. Men with pony tails, women with nose rings, and both with T-shirts, are not behaving eccentrically; they are being utterly conventional. The trouble is that the convention they are upholding is one of cocking a snook at the very values that teachers should uphold."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my selection of supporting evidence and quotes I refer to the 	<i>Chronical & Echo (Northampton)</i> to show that the whole country is taking an interest in the matter. A lady journalist who writes "Rosie Rushton's woman's view" in that newspaper said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Yes it is wholly relevant. How can teachers who obviously don't value themselves enough to look passably presentable expect pupils to afford them any respect?"</p></blockquote>
It is clearly an issue about teachers as role models and gaining respect. The issue of respect was supported by a head teacher in St. George's school in Broadstairs who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It helps to get respect from pupils. After all, we ask them to wear uniforms, so it is only right that we make an effort as well."</p></blockquote>
Wendy Davies, a head teacher at the Medway community college in Chatham agreed that "scruffy teachers" were not necessarily an issue for her but said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Teachers do get more respect if they are smartly dressed but this cannot make up for good teaching skills, a good attitude and mutual respect for the children."</p></blockquote>
She made the point that it is not just a one-way respect; it is mutual. That was backed up by a Chatham South school head teacher who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have a dress code to make sure our staff dress correctly. We act as a role model for children. If they take pride in their appearance, they will take pride in themselves and their work."</p></blockquote>
There are many reasons why I believe that my amendments are an appropriate path to take. They will help to increase the respect for teachers and the respect that they have in the classroom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Slovenliness, like beauty, is too often in the eye of the beholder. I am fascinated by how the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During my hon.

It resulted in the child, who was on a scholarship at that independent school, being expelled because the relationship between the head teacher and the parent had broken down. It was a dispute over what the head teacher was wearing on a Saturday afternoon. Is not the amendment in danger of taking us down that ridiculous road?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No we are not in danger of going down that road at all.

Yet when we discuss the public sector's employment of teachers—500,000 teachers with at a total cost to the public sector of many billions of pounds—the Opposition do not seem to have a view; nor do they seem to have a view about raising standards. They do not even seem to be supporting their shadow spokesman who supported my amendment in his statement to the 	<i>Sunday Times.</i> I am staggered that the Opposition no longer support their own shadow spokesman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already explained that it would be appropriate dress as determined by the head teacher, the governing body and, I would expect, through consultation with parents. It is up to individual schools to determine what would be appropriate in the circumstances.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I understand the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arnold</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am asking my hon. Friend the Member for Dover whether he agrees with the hon. Member for Barking. I find it strange that the Labour spin doctors require Labour candidates to go on all this "Colour me Beautiful" stuff organised by the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes the point completely. All Opposition Members are smartly dressed and wearing suits. They have all changed their image. Why have they done that? They have done it because some image consultant and the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson) have told them to dress up. Why? It is because they want to get respect and become role models. If they achieve that, they realise that they might get to win a few elections. Clearly, if they want it for themselves, they ought to want it for teachers. They should also want the benefits to go to the pupils of this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be some confusion in the hon.

People there wore all sorts of dress and were encouraged to wear national dress on occasions. That was a cultural thing. The hon. Gentleman wants to provide for that in the Bill, and that is unnecessary.

I trained teachers for a long time. I encouraged them to examine the practice of the schools in which they worked and I advised them that it was wise to conform to that practice. I did not, however, want such provisions in law.—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I emphasise that earlier in the week we debated the £200,000 payments by the public sector to individual schools and an assisted-places scheme that costs £200 million, but we are now discussing the costs of employing teachers, which amount to £10 billion for the country. I want to raise professional standards, so that teachers become members of professional bodies and work to the highest professional standards. That would benefit teachers. Not only would it raise the standard of their work, but it would raise their salaries over time and increase the respect that they receive from the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are not designed to enforce a particular dress code. They do not stipulate what teachers should wear. They would enable head teachers to set standards for their schools. That would involve appropriate dress for appropriate lessons and for appropriate circumstances in individual schools. Obviously allowance would be made for art and PE lessons and for primary schools and different circumstances. Allowance would also be made for dress down days in schools, but teachers who were not properly or reasonably dressed would probably not be employed in the longer term. The amendments are designed to achieve a raising of dress standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Appearance is relevant in conveying messages. I am indebted to Mrs. Elizabeth Warren, an associate member of the Federation of Image Consultants, which is just the sort of organisation that the Labour party consults regularly. Mrs. Warren wrote to the 	<i>Times</i> on 8 November and said that the approach I have adopted has a "soundly researched basis". She said that people tend to be judged by their appearance first and then by what they say. She added that the message conveyed by appearance may be believed and not the words spoken. That is a lesson not just for teachers, but for politicians. We must ensure that teachers' dress is smart, so that it neutralises the effect of dress in classroom. That might enable pupils to concentrate on the message that is being spoken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are designed to raise professional standards. They would ensure that teachers operate in the 1990s and through the millennium to higher standards than we saw is schools in the 1970s, 1980s and, in the few that remain with low standards, in the 1990s. Raising standards would increase respect for teachers and the recognition of them as role models.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been a light-hearted discussion about the amendments. The Opposition share the wish of the hon. Member for Dover to reprofessionalise the teaching profession, a phrase that I have used on many occasions. The hilarity on this side of the Committee was at the idea that that should be done by dictating by law what teachers should wear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can help teachers raise the status of their profession in many ways, for example, by enabling them to work in buildings with roofs that do not leak, by giving them enough resources to do their job, and by having class sizes that enable them to use their skills to the full.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>426</span>
The argument about restoring professionalism to the teaching profession is serious and deserves our attention. It is partly this Government's actions over 17 years that have caused the problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the biggest single thing that could be done to increase the sense of professionalism among teachers would be to establish a general teaching council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. As he knows, his suggestion is already part of Labour's plans in government, and I hope that we shall be able to discuss it at a later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Dover that teachers are important role models, not just in what they wear but in how they deal with pupils and adults in school. When I was a teacher, I advised young people going for interviews how to dress appropriately for the occasion. That is an important part of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our objection to the amendment is that the hon. Gentleman did not give any evidence of teachers who do not dress appropriately. There are none in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, in my constituency or in my hon. Friend's constituency. Apparently, they are somewhere else. The amendment is not necessary. Head teachers and governing bodies already have the power to discuss with their staff appropriate patterns of behaviour and conduct. Governing bodies already have the right to call head teachers to task if they fail to take appropriate action if a teacher dresses badly and in a way that affects the pupils. The power exists—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, as I want to finish what I have to say. I trust head teachers to behave in a way that protects their pupils and to ensure that members of staff behave in the most professional manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment will be interpreted as an attempt by Parliament to legislate on how teachers should dress. That will not help help us to raise standards and reprofessionalise the profession. We do not support the amendment but we agree that teachers are important role models and that dress is an important factor which they think about when going to work every day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Yardley, I am unable to support the amendment. I thank the hon. Lady for lowering the tone a little, as the points raised by the hon. Member for Dover are important. Although I do not agree with his proposed way forward, it is timely once in a while for us to discuss the issues, especially when evidence shows that how people dress can influence others. There is clear evidence, admittedly from America, which shows that how teachers dress can have a significant impact not just on pupils' behaviour but on their academic performance. It is important that from time to time we are reminded of those facts and of the evidence that supports them.

We have already heard that sufficient powers exist to enable head teachers and governors to take action against those teachers who they believe are inappropriately dressed. Rather than accept the amendments, it would be more appropriate to draw the attention of governors and head teachers to the powers that already exist, but also to acknowledge—and this was a critical point made by the hon. Member for Yardley—that the time has come to think of ways of reprofessionalising teachers. If we are to tell our teachers that we expect more from them, we must promise in return that we shall let them get on and do their job without our telling them all the nuts and bolts of how they are to do it. We already intrude too much by telling teachers how to teach; it is inappropriate to tell them that we will specify in detail how they are to dress, rather than leaving it to them to make appropriate choices of dress within the regulations that already exist.

I wish to explain to the hon. Member for Dover, who has performed a service in raising the issue, why I cannot support him by demonstrating the dangers of trying to lay down too clear a set of rules on particular issues. Fashions and times change. To illustrate the point, members of the Committee—particularly the hon. Member for Barking—may be interested to hear a similar code that was introduced in 1915 and applied to all female teachers working in London at that time. It includes the following:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You will not marry during the term of your contract; you are not to keep company with men; you must be home between 8 pm and 6 am unless attending a school function; you may not loiter in the ice-cream parlours."—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that that must be upsetting to the hon. Gentleman. The rules continue:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You may not travel beyond the city limits without the permission of the Chairman of the Board; you may not ride in a carriage or automobile with any man unless he be your father or brother; you may not smoke cigarettes;—to keep the school room clean, you must sweep the floor at least once daily, clean the blackboard at least once daily, and start the fire at 7 am."</p></blockquote>
The rules also included a dress code:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You may not dress in bright colours; you may, under no circumstances, dye your hair; you must wear at least two petticoats and dresses must be no shorter than two inches above the ankles."</p></blockquote>
The problem with the amendment is that it may create a set of rules that another hon. Member may read out in another 70 years' time to equal amusement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some members of the Committee may think it bizarre that I should respond to the amendment—I thought I would say that before anyone else, although the hon. Member for Barking hinted at it earlier. If the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) were ever to think of tabling an amendment on the lines that he suggested, he might attract unexpected support from some surprising quarters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This useful debate has brought out several important points. There has been a welcome agreement from all hon. Members who have spoken
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>428</span>
that there is a strict limit to what can and should be dictated from the centre, particularly in terms of behaviour. That is an important agreement which we should perhaps all bear in mind when considering other parts of the Bill. There is a surprising degree of consensus that to put too much in a Bill or even in regulations is not always the right way to do things in the educational sphere. There is a temptation among us legislators to try to advance our beliefs through the medium of legislation—through statute and regulation. The Government are as guilty as anyone of that. Surely we have a responsibility to judge whether or not those things are appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been widespread agreement that the way in which teachers—role models and educators—dress, present themselves and behave is crucially important. We readily agree on that, but there is not so much agreement on the contention made by Opposition Members and by my hon. Friend the Member for Dover. I have observed, even during the past few years, an enormous improvement in the way in which teachers present themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has probably been a similar improvement in, for example, the House of Commons. I have not been here as long as my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. Pawsey) so I do not know whether he agrees that the past 10 or 15 years have seen an improvement in how Members of Parliament dress and present themselves, partly because of peer pressure—and I do not mean from the other place. The greater visibility of Members because of the televising of the House and my colleagues' frequent appearances on College green have a part in that improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is true of education. I agree with Opposition Members—and must, with regret, part company with my hon. Friend the Member for Dover—that more then adequate mechanisms exist to bring about what my hon. Friend wants. Time and again in Committee we have talked of parental pressure, the role of governors and the response that governors, teachers and heads must make to parents' desires. All that can improve standards and, in this case, the way in which teachers present themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that, the Committee must weigh whether my hon. Friend's suggestions are appropriate and would bring about an improvement. My hon. Friend has heard a lot of agreement from the Opposition and me, but, on balance, my judgment is that it would not be appropriate to go to the lengths that he suggests by putting his measures in the Bill. As I often do, I should rather rest on existing accountability in schools, on parental pressure—which we all believe to be a force for good throughout education—and on the judgment of governors and heads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I believe that my hon. Friend's amendment would go perhaps a half-step too far. In confidence that my hon. Friend's aims can be achieved through existing mechanisms, I suggest that his amendment is unnecessary at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Committee for the debate and, despite some disagreements, for the measure of agreement that I heard. I should make it clear that nowhere in the amendment do I define the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>429</span>
actual dress required. My amendment would give complete freedom to head teachers, and flexibility would remain for schools and for individual lessons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that mechanisms exist. Perhaps, as a result of the debate, those mechanisms will improve, and people will take advantage of them. I hope that the authority of head teachers has been reinforced. Some schools operate to a very high standard already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot completely avoid the issue when setting conditions of employment in the public sector. Those conditions should sometimes be considered from the centre. The public sector pays the teachers' salaries bill of £10 billion or more.

teacher must take into account. We discussed the involvement of governing bodies in establishing a policy framework, which the Bill describes as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a … statement of general principles".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would allow the head teacher to decide which measures to implement to secure discipline and good behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause proposes a change in the current practice of establishing a clear division of responsibilities. The governing body should set the general principle and the head teacher should have the power to determine the measures to enforce that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of the clause surprises me. It is at variance with principles that Ministers apply consistently in other aspects of governance. The Government make a distinction between policy making and executive action. The Home Secretary frequently refers to that distinction when he disclaims responsibility for matters that he claims are of an executive nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept the wording of the clause, we give governors an executive role. That is not their purpose. Heads and teachers should run schools. We made that point when we discussed dress codes. Heads and teachers are accountable for their actions to governors, the local education authority and the Secretary of State. However, governors should not be involved in the day-to-day running of the school. That would happen if they set disciplinary measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are governors competent to determine disciplinary measures for specific circumstances? Teachers are the professionals, and governors are the lay people who provide the mechanism for accountability. The teachers should make professional decisions about discipline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should remember that a school discipline policy is intended not simply to punish children but to get them to learn. Disciplinary measures should be focused on returning children to the learning system, not just on punishment. For example, in the case of a child who committed a series of misdemeanours, refusing to do what he or she was told, chatting continuously in what was supposed to be silent reading time, throwing pencils across the room and perhaps even truanting from the class, the problem might be that the local education authority had not dealt with a statement for the child—something that was necessary in that particular. case to provide proper support in a mainstream class. Punishment, using disciplinary measures established by governors, would set off a further spiral of failure, instead of establishing responses to keep the child in the learning system, or focusing on what school is all about—getting a child to learn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, if a child does wrong, it is, surely, proper for the teacher, not the governing body, to be responsible for the punishment. If the governors are responsible, children will see no link between their behaviour and the punishment. The teacher will simply be administering punishments laid down by the governing body—a tariff. That is not a good way to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>431</span>
achieve a culture of discipline and good behaviour. A link between a child's behaviour and the people who administer punishments—the teachers and the head teacher—is essential. Without that, disciplinary actions will not assist in establishing an environment and atmosphere of good behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of a tariff for punishment, which is implied in the Bill, is misconceived. I came across two cases recently which illustrate my point. One concerned a child of a well-to-do family. The child was at public school, but was removed from there after the parents lost their money. No assisted place was made available. The family went into accommodation for the homeless. The child was suddenly taken from one environment and placed somewhere completely different. He had an hour's journey to school, he had to deal with a mixed-sex environment, whereas previously he had been in a single-sex school, and he was coping with a different syllabus and a different set of children, perhaps rather more worldly wise than he, and used to a different way of relating to each other. Also, he was in the pre-puberty stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That child could not cope with the transition. He walked out of school, did not concentrate in classes, was rude and aggressive to teachers and chewed gum in class. The parents blamed the school for the child's behaviour. The school could not cope and the child needed stability. Specific disciplinary measures decided upon by the governors, in accordance with the Bill, could have been completely inappropriate in his case. They would simply have focused on the fact that he had misbehaved, rather than on the reason. That would not have helped the family or the school. Most importantly, it would probably have resulted in the child's being taken out of school just when he needed stability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another case I came across was that of a child who had been late for school 15 times. That child had been consistently warned, but still arrived late. If, as the Bill suggests, there were a tariff laid down by governors, that child could have been suspended or even expelled. In fact, that child was being abused at home and was on the "at risk" register. A tariff would have been completely inappropriate in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will take note of the common-sense approach that the amendments set out for maintained and grant-maintained schools. Proposals to give governors the power to determine specific punishments in specific circumstances are misconceived. They will not help to improve discipline and order in a school; they could stop children staying in the learning system; and they reflect a muddle between what professionals and lay governors should take responsibility for. It is the job of lay governors to set the general principles, but the job of the professionals—head teachers and their staff—to determine what is appropriate in particular circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the main aims of clauses 20 and 21 is to increase the role of the governing body in promoting good behaviour and discipline within the school. Surely a governing body has a key part to play in influencing the school's ethos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>432</span>
A governing body may, therefore, have views about particular measures, such as after-session detention, which it would want the head teacher to take into account when determining the school's disciplinary code. It may have views on particular matters, such as bullying and racial harassment, but it would be invidious to say that the governing body is perfectly free to offer its views on particular matters, but not on measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly it is the head teacher's duty to determine the school's discipline policy. He must implement it on a day-to-day basis. If it was the head teacher's considered view that a particular measure suggested by the governing body were not feasible, he would not necessarily be obliged to adopt it. However, I do not think that we should deny the governing body the opportunity to offer a view on particular measures as well as matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are unnecessary. They place an unnecessary emphasis on the exclusive role of the head teacher and seek to preclude a legitimate role for the governing body. For those reasons, I ask the Committee to reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the Minister's reply. He did not show an enormous amount of interest in the amendments. If a governing body lays down particular measures and a head teacher has to have regard of those measures, the potential for conflict arises if the head teacher chooses not to adopt them. The purpose of a punishment regime and a set of disciplinary measures is that they should be appropriate to particular circumstances and should have the aim of keeping a child in the learning system. Clearly, the Minister does not understand that, but, in view of the importance of the proposals, I shall not put them to a vote. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are designed to tease out the Minister's views on local education authorities' contribution in providing guidance to schools on pupil behaviour and discipline. We are trying simply to acknowledge that the LEAs have a role in supporting schools when they draw up and implement sound, effective pupil behaviour policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local education authorities routinely offer advice to schools on a wide range of matters. Teachers, governors and the wider community accept and value that as a vital element of the LEA's role in supporting the efficient running of schools. I am sure that the Minister would accept that both sides of the House increasingly agree that that supportive role is vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>433</span>
The Bill rightly acknowledges that, when drawing up individual school policies to promote good behaviour and discipline,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the governing body shall have regard to any guidance given from time to time by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
But it does not acknowledge the contribution that LEAs can, and do, make. The amendments are intended to rectify what I should like to think was an oversight by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
LEAs have considerable expertise and experience in the administration and management of schools. They can make a unique contribution in supporting schools, individually and in the wider local perspective. That contribution is informed by the LEA's knowledge of the needs and circumstances of all local schools. LEAs are also uniquely able to identify and disseminate examples of best practice among schools in their areas and to bring good practice elsewhere to the attention of their own schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government themselves acknowledged in the June White Paper "Self-Government for Schools" that LEAs have the supportive role to which I have referred. It would be a revelation if the Government were to reject our amendment out of hand, effectively repudiating the sentiments of their own White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already made it clear that it will be important when the governing body is preparing its written statement of general principles that it should have access, as needed, to guidance on pupil behaviour and discipline. That will ensure that the governing body is as well informed as possible about those important issues. That is why clauses 20 and 21 require the governing body to have regard to any guidance given from time to time by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We last issued guidance in May 1994. One of the circulars in what became popularly known as the six-pack on "Pupils with Problems" dealt specifically with pupil behaviour and discipline. It built on the findings of the 1989 Elton report "Discipline in Schools" and offered guidance to help schools maintain good behaviour. It gave advice on the responsibilities of head teachers and governing bodies; and it encouraged them to develop whole-school behaviour policies. It was generally well received and widely used. We intend to build on that guidance in the light of the provisions on discipline in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At first sight there was some attraction in the hon. Member's amendments, but the effect would be specifically to require the governing body to have regard to any guidance given either by the Secretary of State or by the LEA. That could have quite far-reaching implications for how a governing body approached the important task of preparing its statement of general principles. No two LEAs are the same in every respect. Their approach to, or philosophy about, pupil behaviour and discipline could differ quite markedly. And the guidance could be variable in quality. More importantly, a governing body could be faced with guidance from an LEA which conflicted with, or contradicted that from the Secretary of State. For example, an LEA might advise
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>434</span>
against the use of particular sanctions which guidance from the Secretary of State had recommended as a reasonable response to a disciplinary incident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, amendment No. 172, which relates to grant-maintained schools, would be wholly inappropriate. Grant-maintained schools are self-governing and they are independent of LEAs. One could not reasonably require them to have regard to any guidance given by the LEA. It would be for grant-maintained schools to decide whether or not to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I urge the Committee to reject these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Government's paranoia about local education authorities has manifested itself again.

I cannot see the inevitability of conflict between guidance issued by the Secretary of State and that issued by the LEAs. I assume that the Secretary of State's guidance always takes precedence, whether or not the local education authority has a different view. We may want to return to these matters, but given that we have established the Government's view on the LEA's role, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Clauses 20 and 21 place on the governing body of all schools the responsibility to prepare a written statement of the principles to which the head teacher must have regard in determining any measures to, for example, promote self-discipline and a proper regard for authority, encourage good behaviour and respect for others, secure acceptable standards of behaviour, and regulate pupil conduct. It is well understood that partnership with parents is invaluable in the development of effective policies for discipline and behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>435</span>
I draw the Committee's attention to the 1989 report of the committee of inquiry chaired by Lord Elton. The report, "Discipline in Schools", states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that parents have a vital role to play in promoting good behaviour in schools. There is much that they can do on their own initiative but they also need help and encouragement from schools."</p></blockquote>
I do not believe that any hon. Member would dispute the vital role of parents in fostering good behaviour. Parents have a legal duty to ensure that their children receive an efficient education. Children need parental encouragement and support to participate fully in their day-to-day school work and in the wider life of the school and the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 44 of the Department for Education and Employment circular 8/94 "Pupil Behaviour and Discipline"—the six-pack to which the Minister referred—states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the school policy to be effective, parents need to cooperate with school in matters of discipline and reinforce the school's efforts at home. Behaviour policies can be reviewed at the governors' annual meeting with parents, and discussed at the meeting between registered inspectors and parents before an inspection."</p></blockquote>
Schools should take whatever steps they can to encourage parents to understand the importance of ensuring that their children take school work seriously—that is self-evident. The involvement of parents, by whatever means, in the development of school policies on discipline and behaviour reinforces the school's commitment to high standards and orderly conduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As parents will learn, when they meet registered inspectors of schools gathering views on the school, parental involvement is an important factor on which the school will be judged through the Ofsted processes. It is right that that should be so. An active partnership between parents and schools offers great benefits. The interaction of home circumstances and school has an important impact on pupils' behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some cases, parents may have experienced difficulties in their own school history, and their views on school disciplinary processes may be founded on negative memories of their own experiences—I am sure that many hon. Members, from whatever party, have personal experience of that phenomenon. The opportunity to replace such views with a more positive approach can be afforded by a school going out to find the parents' views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me digress a little. I remember meeting the then director of education for Strathclyde, Mr. Frank Pignatelli, whose experience was salutary. It was often said that parents in inner-city Glasgow were not interested in what happened to their children—they were happy to leave it up to the schools and the authorities. Mr. Pignatelli found—I believe that any sensible person would recognise this—that many of those parents were alienated from school processes because of their own experiences; indeed, they felt that they had limited access to the educational process because they did not understand the language used. When Mr. Pignatelli used language that they could comprehend and dealt with issues that were important to them as parents, including their own childhoold
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>436</span>
experiences, he was able to involve them in the schools on an unprecedented scale. The sort of partnership that was fostered in Glasgow is generally accepted as an element of good practice, which every school should adopt. Governing bodies should demonstrate such partnerships in this part of school life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This subject is close to the heart of every parent. That is so even if parents do not have the opportunity or confidence to express their views in the way that they might like. The quality of the relationship between governing bodies and parents is enhanced in many ways, some of which are informal; others are more formal processes that take place, for example, during the annual governing body meeting or by publication in school prospectuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should therefore take this opportunity to include in the Bill the appropriate words to ensure that all schools take such matters seriously and sensibly, so producing the partnership that all hon. Members believe to be important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Parents have an important role to play in disciplining their children. We continue to stress that the first and continuing responsibility for a child's behaviour is that of the parents. We have made this clear in guidance, and the parent's charter acknowledges that discipline begins at home. However, too often schools do not get the support that they ought to be able to expect from parents on matters of discipline. We cannot expect schools alone to instil discipline in young people; it must be a shared responsibility. That is why we encourage parents to cooperate and support schools in matters of discipline. Clauses 20 and 21 will require the head teacher to bring the measures he has determined for promoting good behaviour and discipline to the attention of parents, among others, at least once a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the amendment would involve parents further, by requiring the governing body to consult them when preparing its written statement of general principles. That is laudable. I have always emphasised the importance of involving parents in such matters. I believe that many of them would welcome that and generally make an effective contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be outdone by my hon. Friend the Minister of State, who was in a nice mood earlier. In the spirit of Christmas, I will consider the amendment carefully; however I am advised that there is scope to improve its wording. We therefore accept it in principle, and will introduce on Report revised proposals to secure its aims, if the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the Under-Secretary's point about the drafting of the amendment.

So I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 179, in page 17, line 46, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) seek the views of pupils, staff and parents on such measures and give these views due consideration; and".</p></blockquote>
I hope that this amendment will receive a positive response similar to that given in the previous debate—it deals with similar matters. The amendment would place a duty on teachers both to seek and to give due consideration to the views of pupils, staff and parents when determining the school's measures on behaviour. It would not give pupils, staff and parents any power to decide such measures. That would still be the role of head teachers and governors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is based on the common sense principle that such measures will be more effective if the whole school community has been involved in drawing them up. It is based on the Government's most recent guidance on pupil behaviour and discipline as set out in circular 8/94, which itself reflects the recommendations of Lord Elton's 1989 inquiry into school discipline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Elton report recommended that all schools should adopt what he called a "whole school behaviour policy". That was accepted by the Government, who sent out guidance after the enactment of the Education Act 1993 with the express aim of encouraging
	<br><blockquote><p>"a whole-school approach to behaviour and discipline".</p></blockquote>
At paragraphs 21 and 22, the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schools can … nurture a greater sense of responsibility in pupils, and greater commitment to the aims of the school, by encouraging them to discuss the aims and rules of the school. A greater sense of collective commitment to a school's behaviour policy can be fostered if pupils are encouraged to think carefully about what has gone into shaping and reviewing that policy.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Many schools have found that pupils can play a positive role; for example in exposing bullying in their school, in helping design play areas, and in suggesting strategies to deal with problematic situations (eg arrangements for pupils in wet playtimes)."</p></blockquote>
The latter is often the bane of head teachers and staff, especially in Wales where we have rather a lot of liquid sunshine during the winter months and some even in the summer. The report also suggested:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schools' councils and other participative approaches are possible means of encouraging pupils to become involved."</p></blockquote>
The recent Ofsted report entitled, "Exclusions from Secondary School" noted in paragraph 56:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The great majority of schools (and almost all high excluders) made little effort to involve pupils themselves in fostering and setting high standards of behaviour. The senior pupils interviewed by HMI showed a perceptive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of their schools and a broad appreciation of what the staff were trying to achieve, yet they felt insufficiently consulted or trusted by staff; expectations of behaviour were set by staff. Sometimes this lack of trust was reciprocated, and a quite unnecessary distance between staff and pupils grew, as it were, by default."</p></blockquote>
The Advisory Centre for Education has recently undertaken research in five Merseyside schools. That, too, reflected the sentiment of the Ofsted report that there was a much better response when schools involved pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned Merseyside schools. My wife's previous school, Windsor Street primary school, which has a school council, was used to promote the concept of school
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>438</span>
councils by School Councils UK. I know from firsthand experience the beneficial effect that a school council can have, involving children from deprived backgrounds in trying to enhance a school's disciplinary ethos in every possible way. For that school, it was a marked success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I applaud what my hon. Friend says about school councils. There is good evidence that they are successful, especially if they are set up with the help and guidance of School Councils UK. I know that Staffordshire and Coventry have pioneered the use of schools councils. Doubtless the Minister will know of other examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that pupils are involved. There are additional benefits to involving children in the development of such policies. For example, if children are directly involved, they are likely to feel a sense of ownership of the process and responsibility to share in its implementation. A policy drawn up with the participation of pupils will also better address childrens' particular concerns about the behaviour of other children in the school. Pupils are best equipped to contribute to discussions about the extent and impact of bullying and what might be effective strategies to tackle it. From the evidence we have, it is clear that where pupils are involved in dealing with bullying, effective strategies are found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process of producing a policy also provides an excellent opportunity to explore moral values within school, to examine the individual responsibility of each member of the school towards other members and to develop a shared sense of commitment to the good management of the school. That can influence the role of pupils and young people in society—which can only be of advantage as they grow up to become adults. Learning through being listened to and having opportunities for genuine participation is an important educational experience, and is vital to the process of understanding social responsibility and citizenship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already mentioned that some schools have developed behaviour codes through collaboration with pupils, and others have introduced peer counselling systems to tackle bullying. However, despite the guidance given by the Department for Education and Employment and by the Welsh Office, such practice is unfortunately still far from widespread. That is why we want to encourage all schools to explore children's participation in advancing good school discipline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When moving the previous amendment, my hon. Friend the Member for Walton mentioned the importance of the involvement of parents and quoted the Government circular, "Pupil Behaviour and Discipline". I should like to quote a further sentence from that circular:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An active partnership between parents and schools offers great benefits … parental support for the school's policies is crucial."</p></blockquote>
So we know that the Government are right behind the policy of greater parental involvement. We want to introduce such active participation as early as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>439</span>
The final party mentioned in the amendment are the staff of the school. Obviously, good head teachers already involve teaching staff in formulating the school behaviour code, although the Bill does not require it. We deliberately refer to the staff of the school in the amendment, because we want to ensure that the non-teaching staff are also involved. A good example of non-teaching staff who are involved at the sharp end are playground and lunchtime supervisors. They often have to deal with disruptive pupils and instances of bullying or vandalism, so it is important that they be involved too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All we are asking of the Government is that they take half a step beyond their current position as enshrined in the Bill. Clause 20(6)(b) will require head teachers
	<br><blockquote><p>"at least once in every year, … to bring"</p></blockquote>
—the policy—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to the attention of all such pupils and parents and all persons employed at the school."</p></blockquote>
Once the policy is in place, the head teacher has a statutory responsibility, enshrined in the Bill, to hold these annual consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be useful, therefore, to ensure that the involvement of pupils, parents and staff in drawing up such a policy, was enshrined in the Bill in the same way as their involvement is sought once the policy has been created. I therefore hope that the Government will accept that we are trying to take the process one stage further than the Government have already accepted. The amendment will help to give legal force to good practice which, unfortunately, is not sufficiently widespread despite all the best efforts of the Government through circulars and reports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly surprised and even a little disappointed that the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) should advance that argument so soon after the hon. Member for Yardley stated robustly in a previous debate that to seek to impose excessively from the centre in these matters was unnecessary and, in many cases, undesirable. As the hon. Gentlleman characteristically and generously referred to the circular 8/94, it would be appropriate if I quoted just one paragraph from it. Paragraph 19 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although the governing body should take a clear lead in proposing principles and standards, the school's behaviour policy should be worked out in a spirit of cooperation with the head teacher and the whole of the teaching and non-teaching staff."</p></blockquote>
Then, crucially for the purposes of this amendment, it concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The policy should be discussed with parents and pupils, and should feature in the annual report to parents. It would therefore be appropriate for key elements of the school behaviour policy to be included in the school prospectus."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pointed out that the full weight of the Department was behind the consultation process taking place at the preparation stage of the policy. But I also pointed out that the Ofsted report on exclusions indicates that this advice is not being taken very widely; our amendment was designed only to move what is already on the face of the Bill one step further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>440</span>
I do not want to labour the point, but what is the Minister's reaction to the fact that it would appear that many schools are not following the good advice that his Department is giving on this issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That brings us to the nub of our consideration of the amendment, which runs through much of what, I suspect, we shall continue to discuss in Committee. Is it better to rely on a combination of guidance, Ofsted inspections, parental pressure, the professionalism of teachers and all those other mechanisms to which we have repeatedly alluded, or to pretend that putting something in statute will in itself alter behaviour in a way that those other means have not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me put the matter at its most extreme. Let us suppose that we legislated and brought down the entire majesty of this Committee, the House of Commons and the other place on the heads of schools. Let us suppose that the odd school still did not comply. Would the hon. Gentleman take it to court or imprison the staff? Would he reintroduce corporal or capital punishment? That raises a serious point as to how far one should legislate and put into statute a statement of desire when we all know—and in our calmer moments would all be rather reassured to know—that there is not much that we can do if it does not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are moving things forward here; the hon. Gentleman and I agree about that. We are trying to find the right institutional arrangements to allow and encourage incremental improvements. There is a small, but crucial, difference between us: I shrink from putting too much in legislation because I have been in this game long enough to know that behaviour cannot be changed for the better simply by legislation—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot tolerate chatting in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope, in the spirit of the debate, that the hon. Gentleman accepts that although not every school is a model of perfection, what is on the statute and in the circular, combined with Ofsted inspections and parental pressure, means that there has been sufficient improvement, which I hope will continue. We should accept that combination of existing provisions and resist the natural temptation to put amendments of this kind in the Bill. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his response, although he used rather florid language to describe extreme situations which he knows would not occur. I agree with him that it is a matter of judgment how successfully the current system of providing advice and guidance at the preparatory stage is working. I accept, too, that it is early days in the development of the policy, although I remain anxious that so many schools have not yet got it right. It is ironic that the Minister is worried about the weight of the law being brought upon schools, governors, heads and local education authorities. There has been an Education Bill almost every year which does just that because the Government believe that it is needed. We

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the dying days of this speech!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. We are not going to make any fundamental changes. We have aired the issue and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 72, in page 18, line 10, after "of", insert "(i)".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 71, in page 18, line 11, after "school", insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and (ii) pupils known to be likely to be registered at the school within the next term so far as he can".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Judging from the tenor of the debate, there is considerable agreement on both sides of the Committee about the principles enshrined in clause 20. There is agreement about the importance of establishing a whole-school approach to behaviour and discipline. It is also agreed that the governors should establish key principles with that aim and that the head teacher should, after consultation with various bodies, be responsible for drawing up the necessary measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that there is also agreement that, having drawn up those measures, they should be made available so that people know what they are. That is eminent common sense and it has my full support. It is right and proper that the Bill proposes that the measure should be made generally known within the school and to the parents of registered pupils, and that once a year, a further attempt is made to draw it to the attention of various bodies. The amendment seeks, to paraphrase the Minister, to find the right institutional arrangements. We talk a lot about the importance of home-school relationships, which are the subject of clause 30. That point is critically important to parents of pupils about to enter the school. If they are to participate fully in school life, it is important that before a child arrives there, parents have as much information as possible about the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will, no doubt, say that of course some details of behaviour and discipline will be covered in the school's prospectus and that many parents will have received a copy. I accept that that will be the principal way in which parents obtain information, but if I am to be persuaded not to press the amendment, I should like further assurances that information about these important matters will be made widely available to parents, including the parents of potential pupils. I await the Minister's response before deciding how much further to press the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought for a moment that the hon. Gentleman would be his reasonable self and so it appeared for much of his speech. His reference to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>442</span>
prospectus was helpful, but he glossed over two important points. One is whether it is the responsibility of the head teacher to spoon feed the entire surrounding population. The second is whether it is the responsibility of parents looking at schools for their children to take reasonable measures to find out what each school offers. It has become usual practice, has it not, that parents visit a school, get a prospectus, and talk to the head or to other teachers. Caring parents would rightly do that. Whether it is reasonable to turn that on its head and state that a hard-pressed head teacher should spend a great deal of time—not to mention a large amount of a school's money—disseminating this information is quite another matter. If we consider the matter from that viewpoint, it looks a little different. Let me add that if the Bill were enacted, we would expect to produce guidance—that will not surprise the Committee, nor will the fact that we would consult before doing so—and elicit responses from head teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath assumes that head teachers would be enamoured of all that process, would spend much time imagining which parents might want to send their children to their schools and would send them a note outlining their policy on discipline. Let us wait and see; they might not be too excited about the prospect. The average head teacher would say, "I will, as head, provide as much information about my school as is reasonable because it is in my interests to do so. I want to attract parents to my school; I will not hide anything because I want parents to feel that my school has an effective behaviour and discipline policy." They are, however, unlikely to go to the extent of seeking out parents and giving them the information in the hope that they might visit a school that they had not even considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, the hon. Gentleman has it the wrong way round. If he thinks again, he may realise that his proposal is bureaucratic and unnecessary, and that matters are much better dealt with in ways that are already well provided for. I hope that the Committee will reject his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of Committees often declare that they are disappointed by a Minister's response. Usually that means that they are disappointed that the Minister is not prepared to accede to their proposal. My disappointment now is slightly different; it is disappointment that the Minister has not even read the amendment. It states clearly that the only parents other than those already mentioned in the Bill whom I wish to be given information are parents of
	<br><blockquote><p>"pupils known to be likely to be registered at the school within the next term".</p></blockquote>
Those pupils' names and addresses will already be on school databases, so doing that would not be the significant problem for a head teacher that the Minister suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in what the Minister said, not because it is vital that we press the amendment to a Division, but because his words will have a significant bearing on our consideration of clause 30 which could require parents to sign home-school agreements if
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>443</span>
their children are to get into certain schools. Such parents will need a considerable amount of information and it would therefore be helpful for the Committee to consider the Minister's word when we debate that clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to speculate whether every school has a database as the hon. Gentleman suggessts; one can imagine relatively small rural schools not yet having been blessed with a database. Leaving that aside, the hon. Gentleman also implies that a database is a static thing; in fact, the sort of information about parents that might be on a database is likely to change considerably, especially in the term preceding the summer holidays. There would be a greater management or data handling problem than the hon. Gentleman realises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am absolutely staggered by the Minister's point, although we should not delay proceedings too much. Does the Minister seriously believe that schools do not have a reasonably clear idea of which children will come to them the following term? If so, that is amazing. Of course he is right that some people will leave the list and some enter it, and that circumstances will change, but I do not propose that a headmaster be held accountable in stature for having failed to give information on pupils about whom he knows nothing. The amendment is clearly and carefully worded to ensure that that problem does not cause difficulties for the school or the head teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have elicited some interesting remarks to which I shall return on the debate on clause 30. Having achieved that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>THE CHAIRMAN, 	<i>being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 67,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill:—</p>
	<p>	<i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 20 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 21 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 22</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>DETENTION OUTSIDE SCHOOL HOURS LAWFUL DESPITE ABSENCE OF PARENTAL CONSENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 161, in page 19, line 41, after 'session', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'(which period may fall during a weekend in the school term but not during any period of days which forms a school holiday)'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment would make detention on a Saturday during termtime lawful in the absence of parental consent. We believe that all schools should have access to the widest possible range of rewards and reasonable sanctions. Some schools already successfully use Saturday detentions, but we are not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>444</span>
confident that the Bill makes it sufficiently clear that such detentions are legally enforceable in the same way as, in the words of the clause, detention
	<br><blockquote><p>"after the end of any school session."</p></blockquote>
The recent Ofsted report on exclusions from secondary schools, based on visits to 39 schools, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One simple, but important, requirement is to have enough sanctions that may be applied (or privileges withdrawn). Often high-excluding schools moved to exclusion too quickly, because the hierarchy of sanctions was simply not lengthy enough…"</p></blockquote>
We want to encourage the use of Saturday detentions because they are an effective deterrant. As I said, the amendment has been tabled because there is some doubt about whether the proposed addition to section 550 of the Education Act 1996 will give schools the protection that they seek. If the Minister has been advised that the wording of clause 22 meets the purpose of the amendment, we should welcome an assurance that there will be a specific reference to the use of Saturday detentions in the guidance that will be issued to schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from what the hon. Gentleman said that we all want detention to be an effective punishment in the armoury of sanctions available to teachers. Clause 22, therefore, allows a pupil to be detained on disciplinary grounds
	<br><blockquote><p>"after the end of a school session"</p></blockquote>
without the consent of the parent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise deliberately the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"after the end of a school session"</p></blockquote>
because it is important to be clear why the text of the clause is drafted in that way. We mean either at lunchtime or after school. That is where the present legal problem arises: the pupil is being detained at school and there is a risk, as the law stands, of an action for false imprisonment. That arises because the pupil is being kept at a school after the session and without parental consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Saturday morning "detention", or an early morning "detention", which some schools use, are misnomers. If a pupil is told to turn up at some point during the weekend, or before school, as a disciplinary measure, and he does so, he is not being detained as such, so there can be no question of false imprisonment. He will have attended voluntarily and the present legal awkwardness does not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it would be very difficult to legislate to compel pupils to attend early or on non-school days if they choose not to. How does one force a pupil to attend school at those times against his or her parents' wishes? Is the pupil liable to arrest? If so, by whom? Is the pupil or parent to be fined for non-attendance? If so, by whom and how much? The problems posed by the amendment are legion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not preclude schools which successfully use detentions other than at lunchtime or after school from continuing to do so. That is why the clause is drafted as it is and why we have to tread very carefully. I hope that I have clarified the question that the hon. Member for Bridgend rightly asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>445</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an important point at issue, which perhaps the Minister can clarify. If a parent did not allow the child to go to detention at the end of the school session by, for example, arriving at the school to pick up the child, what sanctions would there be against that defiance of the head teacher's wishes—assuming that proper notice has been given?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that in such a case the school would have to consider what further measures might reasonably be taken—possibly a fixed period of exclusion. There is a possibilty of an escalation of the sanctions that could be brought to bear. The question asked by the hon. Member for Devonport illustrates the difficulty that we all know exists. The clause has been drafted in such a way because it seeks rather carefully and tentatively to try to expand the possibilities that are available to schools, teachers and head teachers in a way that we believe is workable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said before that many, if not most, of the proposals in this part of the Bill are very much in response to requests by teachers through their unions and other organisations. Indeed, some union representatives claimed that they virtually drafted this part of the Bill. That support, which I welcome, gives me some encouragement that this part of the Bill will be workable and welcomed by teachers. Of necessity, we have to be careful and cautious about the extent to which we want to expand the provisions. They must be credible in schools, and teachers and head teachers must be prepared to use them. We know that they want to use them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend and I will have come across occasions when head teachers have told us that they—I am choosing my words carefully—use the sanction of keeping a pupil in school at the weekend. However, that sanction can be used only if the pupil essentially volunteers and if the parents agree. It is difficult to image a sanction that would not rest on the parents' agreement. We are in difficult territory. The proposals might not appear to go as far as the hon. Gentleman wants, but I hope that he understands the reasons for that. I hope that he will reconsider the thrust of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his response. I agree that Saturday morning and after-school detentions are difficult territory. As my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) pointed out, parents might disagree with a school and might not even allow their children to stay for after-school detentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Saturday morning detentions are different in that the child is being recalled to school for the detention; he does not stay on after school. Will the Minister consider the legal position of schools that use Saturday morning detentions even though they are essentially voluntary? Are Saturday morning detentions so different from after-school detentions? A child is still being asked to be in school when there is no statutory need for him to be there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 122, in page 20, line 12, after "school", insert "and to parents".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take amendment No. 123, in page 20, line 23, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"together with notification of the opportunity to make representations".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is to make sure that a school's general policy on detentions is known to parents. They would also clear up any confusion over rights to make representations to the head teacher on any practicalities that may arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 22 prevents detentions from being deemed unlawful in certain circumstances when there is an absence of parental consent. The conditions are set out in clause 22(3). Paragraph (a) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the head teacher … must have previously determined, and made known generally within the school, that detention … is one of the measures that may be taken".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 122 would ensure that that policy would be made known to parents. In practice, as well as telling pupils, parents would be notified of the policy when they seek their child's admission to the school. It would be sensible to make the policy clear by putting it into writing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 22(3)(d) requires that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the pupil's parent must have been given at least 24 hours' notice in writing that the detention was due to take place."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 123 would include the requirement that that should include notification of the right to make representations. That would be made clear by a standard sentence in the note, which would be a sensible precaution. Parents would have a recognised route to pursue if there were any genuine difficulty in travel or family arrangements, for example, on a particular day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not intend to add to the burden on heads by opening an argument on the rightness of the decision but merely on its practicality. We hope that the amendments will be accepted as minor adjustments to the Bill which provide sensible safeguards so that the measure will work smoothly in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mean to be as helpful to the hon. Gentleman as I can—it is my morning for being helpful. We have made it clear that teaching and non-teaching staff, pupils and parents should know their school's discipline policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all agreed on the rewards and punishments that will be imposed and the code of conduct for maintaining high standards of behaviour. Clauses 20 and 21 require the head teacher to publicise in a written document the measures for regulating pupil's conduct,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0344">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>447</span>
among other things. The head is required to take steps to bring this to the attention of pupils, parents and staff at least once a year. Parents in particular need to know the measures that the head teacher has determined to promote good behaviour and discipline in the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 20 and 21 already deliver what the amendment would put into effect. For the avoidance of doubt, and to make clause 22 consistent with the working of clauses 20 and 21, I accept in principle amendment No. 122. However, to avoid ambiguity and to reflect the wording in earlier clauses, we would like to introduce a revised proposal on Report to secure that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of amendment No. 123, we want detention to be an effective punishment in the armoury of sanctions available to teachers. Clause 22 therefore allows a pupil to be detained on disciplinary grounds after the end of a school session without the consent of the parent. However, the clause safeguards children's and parents' legitimate rights and ensures that there are reasonable limits on detention for children who misbehave. Schools will not have an unqualified right to impose detention. That is why the Bill specifies the requirement of 24 hours' written notice. The main purpose of the notice is to inform parents that their child is to be kept in detention on a particular day for a certain length of time and so will be home late, but it will also allow parents enough time to make the necessary representations about the imposition of a detention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want it to be clear what we mean by representations. We are not in the business of setting up or encouraging formal mechanisms for parents to negotiate or appeal against a detention. We want to ensure that the school has the relevant facts in its possession. The 24 hours' notification will allow sufficient time for the parent to bring any relevant matters to the school's attention. That would obviously be relevant when a detention coincided with a religious festival, for example, when a child needed transport arrangements to be made, but the parent was unable to collect the child on that particular day and there was no reasonable alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consulted on the new statutory framework, most respondents identified the need for clear and comprehensive guidance about the practicalities of imposing detention. We agree with that. There is not so much as a cigarette paper between the hon. Member for Bridgend and I on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The content of the written notice is a good example of an issue that we will need to cover. The detail which amendment No. 123 would include in the Bill is best dealt with in guidance. It is not appropriate for legisation. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendments in the light of my assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for her reply.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>448</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 162, in page 20, line 23, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'or, in rural areas, 48 hours' notice'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment makes it a condition on schools that impose detention without parental consent that they give parents in rural areas 48 hours' notice of the detention. Detention without parental consent raises concerns about the possibility of a child's being placed in danger, unless the parents ensure that he or she can get home safely. That problem faces all schools and parents, but is perhaps most acute in rural areas. In responding to the previous debate, the Under-Secretary of State said that the issue was important and that wide consultation had taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed new section 550A(4)(b)(iv) includes travel arrangements among the conditions that must be taken into account in considering whether a detention is reasonable. It does not really deal with the problem that would arise if a parent agreed to make arrangements but forgot, or failed to carry them out, which could result in children being put at risk. In rural areas there is a case for allowing parents extra time to make arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be borne in mind that if detention is to be effective, it should follow fairly quickly on the crime, so to speak. However, that needs to be balanced against parents' need to make the appropriate travel arrangements. Buses in rural areas are less frequent than elsewhere, and it can be more difficult to arrange help from friends of the child or the family. The extra 24 hours for proper preparation could therefore be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would be in line with the proposals in the Government's consultation paper, which mentioned two days' notice. We are encouraged in making our proposal by the fact that rural areas are now well defined in local government and housing legislation. We believe that it will be possible to operate the amendment's requirements successfully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The irony of the matter is that the 24 hours requirement reflects the response to our consultation on the new statutory framework, which we carried out during the summer. Our original proposal required parents be given at least two days' written notice in all cases. An overwhelming number of respondents argued that two days was too long and that it would weaken the effectiveness of the sanction by delaying its imposition—that punishment delayed is punishment denied. Many schools argued that one day's written notice was sufficient and already worked well in practice. We accepted the force of those arguments.

I accept that a satisfactory definition of a rural area might well exist in legislation framed for other purposes, but the question of whether that definition would be appropriate in the present instance should at least be pondered. However, my objection to the amendment does not rest on that.

Proposed new section 550A(5) allows notice of a detention to be given to a pupil's parents either in accordance with section 572 of the Education Act 1996, by handing it to the parents, delivering it to their

last known address or posting it to that address, or by any other effective method of delivery. That could be by pupil post, preceded by a telephone call to the parent. The clause contains ample scope for parents, perhaps especially those in rural areas, to have sufficient time to make the necessary arrangements. I understand the hon. Gentleman's anxiety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that the punishment should follow the crime swiftly. In the majority of cases, 24 hours' notice will be sufficient. However, during consultation, did the Minister receive any response from rural areas that suggested that 48 hours' notice would be preferable? Did the response from rural areas show that 24 hours was sufficient?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that any bias was overwhelmingly towards 24 rather than 48 hours. However, there was a suggestion that that might be a problem in rural areas. We must observe that carefully. On balance and on advice, and given the weight of consultation, 24 hours is right. However, if difficulties emerged in rural areas—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister explain an important point? If pupil post is used to deliver a note to parents to inform them that detention will take place and they have 24 hours to make the necessary arrangements, what would happen if a recalcitrant child did not deliver the letter? Could the parents complain that they had not received due notice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have noticed that I was sticking more closely to my notes than I sometimes do. Referring to an effective method of delivery, I said that it could be by pupil post, preceded by a telephone call to the parent. The hon. Gentleman knows better than I the tricks that the odd pupil can play. We must allow the school and the head teacher to exercise discretion. They know the pupils and the parents, and can ascertain the best method of communication. Pupil post preceded by a telephone call may be a viable option. If the hon. Gentleman, with his experience, advises me that that will not wash, who am I to argue with him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that parents should provide evidence to the school to show that they have received the notice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, we do not want to go that far. There is a danger of becoming hopelessly bureaucratic. We are trying to give teachers and head teachers effective sanctions, and to strike a balance, but we want to build in reasonable protection for parents and pupils. We believe that we have struck that balance. Evidence shows that our proposals are widely supported by schools, teachers and their organisations. However, I accept that we may have to reconsider the matter in future if we have got it wrong. I suspect that our provisions are not the last word on the matter, just as the Education Act 1993, in which I played a small role
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>450</span>
with some pride, was not the last word. In his more generous moments, the hon. Member for Bridgend would concede that we have reconsidered some issues and admitted that some provisions of the 1993 Act were not quite right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am becoming more disappointed in the Minister as he continues. He is saying that we have not got the proposal right and that we might have to reconsider it. I do not want to undermine a point on which we all agree—that proper sanctions that are understood should exist—but I am worried that unco-operative parents may be able to elude the measure and get away with it. The Minister must be clear. Should a school have to show positive evidence that a parent had received notification that a detention was to take place? If the wording is left loose and flabby—we do not know, for example, whether there should be a phone call or a note sent with the child—the awkward, unco-operative parents will have a route through which to steer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has now elicited quality advice—I now have the real thing, and he will not have to rely on my attempts to answer the question—which relates to the reference in new section 550A(5) to "effective method" of delivery. The school will need to satisfy itself that parents are reasonably likely to have received notification. We are back to our old friend "reasonable", which is, of course, the foundation of the whole British judicial system—long may it be so—so I cannot give a hard-edged, definitive answer to the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister then accept that there will be many—probably 24,000—different definitions of the word "reasonable"? If a parent decides that reasonable action has not been taken for notification, might not head teachers and governors find themselves involved in litigation with our old friends the lawyers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not be at all surprised. That seems to be the world in which we live. If the hon. Gentleman can find a way to make the measure lawyer-proof—I do not believe that the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Bridgend would—I should very much welcome it. We are in danger of going off at a tangent. There is a perfectly legitimate debate to be had, but it is not dealt with by the amendment. The hon. Member for Devonport may be on to something important—he often is—but I cannot give him a definitive answer. If he can come up with an answer, I am sure that it will emerge in the shape of a further amendment, which I would consider in a positive way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we have got the balance about as right as we are likely to get it. I cannot claim that what we propose is proof against wily and ingenious parents who want to circumvent the measure but, despite our best endeavours since 1944, we have never quite found the answer to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give the reassurance that Labour Members seek except to say—they will be as unsurprised as I am about this response—that we shall give detailed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V002P0I0346">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>451</span>
guidance to schools, with suggested options for effective methods of delivery, on which I have no doubt we shall consult in advance. Despite what I have just said, our detailed guidance, even after consultation, might not be the final word on the subject or answer every conceivable problem—it rarely does—but we shall do our best and get closer to an answer than we have so far. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that. I may be more of an optimist than my hon. Friend the Member for Devonport, but I was somewhat encouraged by the Minister's response. I can remember a time when Conservative Ministers were certain that what they were doing was absolutely right, but now we have a Minister who makes concessions. If needs be, we shall come back to the issue and consider whether there should be 48 hours' notice rather than 24 hours' notice in rural areas. In the spirit of Christmas peace and good will, I happily beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 163, in page 20, line 28, after 'case', insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(aa) whether regard has been had to the length of the walking route between the school and the pupil's home, and whether the cost of transport if required will be available to the school other than from resources otherwise allocated in its annual budget'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment would add to the Bill a reference to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the length of the walking route"</p></blockquote>
and the additional transport costs as issues to be taken into account when considering whether a child's compulsory detention is reasonable. There are two main areas of concern to the proposal to allow detention without parental consent: the safety of the child and the increased travel costs that may be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>452</span>
involved. We tabled our amendment to bring both issues before the Committee for further discussion and clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may argue that the matter is covered by clause 22(4) (b) (iv), which provides for transport to be one of the special circumstances to be considered, but we need to probe a little further for more detail. The clause, along with the earlier consultation document, appears to imply that detention can be used only for those whose parents can reasonably make "suitable alternative arrangements". Presumably, the school will define what is reasonable. The Minister has already referred to guidance and, no doubt, this is one of the issues that will be included. Do the Government intend to place the onus on parents to make travel arrangements? If so, would not that undermine the efficacy of the new initiative? Non-co-operative parents will try to charge the school with the duty of care to ensure their child's safe return home if they have given proper notice that they cannot make satisfactory arrangments to collect their child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kilfoyle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend was speaking, a visit that I made to a school on the outskirts of Gloucester flashed through my mind. It is a denominational school with pupils from outlying villages and the only transport is that arranged by the school—small buses take the children home. Being conscious of rural poverty, I ask whether parents will be forced to arrange a taxi because there is no alternative transport to take the child home. Who will pay for the taxi?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend draws our attention to a concrete example of the difficulties that could arise as the clause stands. Our amendment is designed to give some defence for the school, which will be able to argue that detention is reasonable and that the implicit safety of the walking distance has been considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
