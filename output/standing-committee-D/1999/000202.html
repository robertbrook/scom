Draft Census Order 2000</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Census Order 2000.</p></blockquote>
The draft Order in Council gives effect to the Government's proposals for a census in England and Wales on 29 April 2001. The proposals were set out in the White Paper in March 1999.<br><br>
Under the Census Act 1920, an Order in Council is necessary to prescribe the date of the census, the people to be counted, the people to be responsible for making the census returns and the information to be given in those returns. We have had a census in Britain every 10 years since 1801, except for 1941, for obvious reasons. They have usually been held in April, because that allows the necessary field work to be conducted at a time when there are sufficient daylight hours and less risk of poor weather conditions.<br><br>
Following devolution, separate legislative arrangements will be made in Scotland and Northern Ireland for the censuses there. Our proposals comply with European Union guidelines for the 2001 round of censuses.<br><br>
The categories of people to be counted are set out in article 4 of the draft order. Everyone will be recorded at the place where he or she is usually resident. Visitors at an address who are normally resident elsewhere in the United Kingdom will be required to supply full information at their usual residence. That is a change in procedure and will reduce the overall burden on the public, in that information about any individual person will need to be supplied only once. Students and boarding schoolchildren will be regarded as being resident at their term-time address, thus making the census more consistent with the base for the annual mid-year population estimate and, in turn, for that used for resource allocation purposes. Responsibility for making the returns is covered in article 5.<br><br>
The final layout of the questions that will appear on the census form will be published in regulations to be laid before the House when the Order in Council has been made. They will set out the detailed conduct of the census and contain facsimile copies of the forms.<br><br>
Under the Census Act 1920, the questions in italics in schedules 2 and 3 of the draft order can be included only if they are approved by resolution. A few questions in schedule 2 are either new to the census in England and Wales or have been significantly revised since the 1991 census. I shall go through them briefly.<br><br>
Paragraph 2 of schedule 2 relates to the relationship of each person in a household of two or more people to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
first person on the form. The new style of question expands the information that was collected in the 1991 census and responses will provide statistics for more detailed analysis of household and family structure to reflect the need for information on an ever-changing society.<br><br>
Paragraph 9 of the schedule contains a revised question on ethnic groups. The ethnic group question was one of the main successes of the 1991 census. Information from it has been used to provide baseline figures against which the Government can monitor possible racial disadvantage. The wording of the question set out in the draft census order has been extensively researched and tested since then to meet users' requirements for additional information and to be as acceptable as possible to respondents. The form of the question also allows respondents to describe their ethnic group in their own words, using the write-in option.<br><br>
Paragraph 10 allows people to assess their own health during the preceding 12 months as either good, fairly good or not good. The question is new and simple, and the information from it has been demonstrated in sample surveys to have a good predictive power for health policy and the provision of services, particularly for the elderly.<br><br>
Paragraph 11 relates to the provision of unpaid personal help. The Government realise that an increasing amount of unpaid personal help is given to people with poor health and this new question will help the understanding of the variations in the need for care and the targeting of resources more effectively.<br><br>
In paragraph 14, the information from a revised question on academic and vocational qualifications will be used to assist in the better provision of education and training and in the monitoring of the take-up of Government initiatives.<br><br>
Paragraph 16(e) relates to the time since last paid employment. That new question will help to determine local differences in the periods of unemployment and the extent of long-term unemployment. It will also be used to assess and monitor disadvantage and exclusion in education and training planning, labour market analysis and mortality and morbidity studies.<br><br>
A new question about the size of the work force in an employer's organisation or company at the place of work is contained in paragraph 17(b). It will help us to understand changing employment patterns.<br><br>
Paragraph 23 seeks to collect information on the lowest floor level of a household's accommodation. That information will be new only in England and Wales—the question was included in the 1991 Scottish census.<br><br>
The 2001 census White Paper suggested that a question about religion should be included for the first time in the census of England and Wales. That question would help to provide information that would supplement the output from the ethnicity question by identifying ethnic minority sub-groups, especially those whose members originate from the Indian subcontinent, who increasingly prefer to identify themselves by their religion.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0009">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
As it is currently drafted, the schedule to the Census Act 1920 does not permit particulars on such topics to be collected. Consequently, the inclusion of that question in the 2001 census of England and Wales will depend on primary census legislation. To effect that change, a short Bill, the Census (Amendment) Bill, was introduced in the House of Lords on 16 December and received its Second Reading on 27 January.<br><br>
Great care will be taken throughout the process to prevent the inadvertent disclosure of information about identifiable individuals in the tables that are derived from the census, especially those relating to local areas or to specific sub-groups of the population. The security of census data and the measures that will be taken to protect confidentiality in output will be subject to independent reviews, the results of which will be announced prior to the census.<br><br>
I give Committee members an assurance about the confidentiality of all census information. The census office in England and Wales and its partners in Scotland and Ireland have an outstanding record for maintaining confidentiality, and they are determined to maintain it.<br><br>
The main national and local results will be released, to a committed timetable, as speedily as possible over a short period of time. That timetable will be announced when all the production systems have been fully rehearsed.<br><br>
The census is expected to cost an estimated £202.3 million. About three quarters of that will fall into the next two financial years. Financial provision has already been made for that expenditure.<br><br>
The census will meet crucial requirements for statistical information and the burden on those who have to complete the census forms has been kept to the minimum that is consistent with those needs. The questions have been fully tested and found to be acceptable. I am confident that the proposed census package strikes the right balance between meeting the essential needs for statistics and minimising the burden on the public. I commend the Order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I approach this order with the scepticism that the Opposition always approach such matters. The Economic Secretary will be aware that my noble Friends in another place propose to table an amendment to the Census (Amendment) Bill about the religious test, which is of considerable controversy. We believe that the test should be voluntary.<br><br>
I searched through the order for signs of a similar controversy and I asked myself interesting constitutional questions about whether the order could be considered before the Census (Amendment) Bill had been enacted. However, I alighted on the helpful explanatory notes and discovered that this is an entirely uncontroversial order that makes no reference to what is to come. I was unable to find anything to object to in it, and I shall therefore terminate my remarks. I have no intention to cause problems.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether Committee members are as surprised as I am by the remarks of the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin). The Economic Secretary and I recently served on a Standing Committee with the hon. Gentleman, and we became used to him making rather longer, but very good, speeches. However, I intend to speak for slightly longer than he did because important questions need to be asked and because we seek reassurances from the Economic Secretary.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that this is not a controversial measure. Censuses have been efficiently conducted in this country for two centuries, and we have learned from that experience. The census office has a record that is second to none, internationally, and I should like to put on the record our appreciation of the work of its statisticians.<br><br>
There are always worries in relation to orders such as this. On the issue of compulsion, there is general cross-party agreement that we must require people to respond to the census form. Otherwise, the data would not be reliable and the uses to which it is put by the Government would be questionable. However, is it right that people could face prosecution and prison sentences for not answering questions that are particularly intrusive and sensitive? Will the Economic Secretary tell us, from the experience of the 1991 census, whether such people were prosecuted and, if so, how many? The hon. Member for West Dorset referred to a Bill that is in another place in that respect.<br><br>
I am also concerned about privacy, and how that relates to small area information. Commercial firms are allowed to buy some of the information that is collected from the census. In the case of the 1991 census, that sometimes related to areas containing as few as 16 households. Although the information that they receive has no named individuals, when it relates to such small numbers of people it is possible that those analysing the information could identify individuals. I understand that the statisticians who examined that issue in relation to the 1991 census concluded that there was no evidence that it had happened. However, we should be concerned about the possibility of it happening, especially if the census is to contain increased detail in respect of ethnicity. In some areas of the country, people from ethnic minorities are very much in a minority. If one is dealing with small area information that covers only 16 households, someone from an ethnic minority may be easily identifiable. Given that the 2001 census will include more questions about ethnicity, have the Government considered increasing the minimum thresholds?<br><br>
Will the Economic Secretary clarify whether the order is compatible with the Human Rights Act 1999? Because it is a statutory instrument, neither the Economic Secretary nor the Home Secretary are required to certify that it is compatible. Given that the census deals with very detailed information on private individuals, it is important to consider that point. It would be wrong if the order, having been approved by the Committee, were then to be challenged in the courts and found to have transgressed the right to privacy in the Human Rights Act.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0010">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find myself amazed to discover that there is an interesting point here. Can the Economic Secretary tell us whether the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments now inspects statutory instruments in relation to their compatibility with the Human Rights Act?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also hope that the Economic Secretary can reassure us about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Tredinnick <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bosworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, and have been the Chairman of the Select Committee. It would therefore be remiss, if not cowardly, of me not to intervene at this point. The Joint Committee is carefully examining the statutory instruments that are issued by the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and this Parliament. We are concerned that the instruments should not run out of control. The Procedure Committee is also examining aspects of those matters. I assure the hon. Gentleman and the Minister that neither the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments nor the Select Committee has ignored the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be grateful to the hon. Gentleman for having the courage to inform us that his Committee will look at these issues. However, we also need the Minister's assurance that the Government will ensure that statutory instruments are compatible with the Human Rights Act 1999. There is no obligation for them to certify that compatibility on the instrument. Nevertheless, it is right and proper, given that the Government introduced that legislation, that they should reassure us.<br><br>
It is a serious matter when the state requires the disclosure of information—and may send to prison those who do not fulfil that requirement—and, it should ensure that privacy is upheld, especially the right to privacy enshrined in the Human Rights Act, I shall now finish my remarks, as my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. David Heath) wishes to raise a number of points with the Minister on certain detailed questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Heath <span class='memberconstituency'>(Somerton and Frome)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, despite any provocation from the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen).<br><br>
I would like the Minister to respond to two queries on the proposed new questions. The first is on question 10, which deals with general health, and seems to be phrased in the vaguest possible terms. What will be the statistical value of something so subjective? Many respondents to the census will find it difficult to respond to the question as to whether their health has
<br><blockquote><p>"on the whole been good, fairly good or not good."</p></blockquote>
Should they refer to the twinge that they had in their back last Wednesday as "not good" or "fairly good"? It will be difficult to respond to the question, but the real point is whether it will produce data with any statistical value. A mass of statistical information is available through the national health service. What is the added value of this census question?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister make
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
a special effort in regard to Wales? We have quite different definitions for illness from the English ones. In the valleys, the vernacular is not "good", "fairly good" or "not good". There, a person is "bad", "bad in bed"—which is slightly worse—or, worst of all, "bad in bed under the doctor". [<i>Laughter.</i>] Could we perhaps add those three categories in order to conform to the valley vernacular with which the right hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) and I are familiar?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heath</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a temptation to ask whether "mustn't grumble" or "on the panel" might also be valid categories. Those would certainly be the answers that one would get in Somerset. However, I shall not stray in that direction.<br><br>
My second point concerns question 14 in schedule 2, concerning professional qualifications. What is the added value of putting the question in this form, rather than referring to the professional registers, which are a much more convenient and accurate way of assessing who is professionally qualified? It is, however, quite proper that academic or other qualifications should be part of a census return, because they will give a picture of the state of education across the country, as opposed to these narrow definitions of professional qualifications such as teacher, medical doctor, dentist, nurse and so on. That information is already available to the Government. Why does it have to be in the census?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hon. Members for their contributions. I am particularly grateful to the hon. Member for West Dorset for his extremely brief contribution. I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) for not doing a book review today, a temptation that he has fallen into many times elsewhere.<br><br>
If I may work backwards, I shall reply first to the questions about health, and the question raised by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. We have found that information on long-term illness is a useful indicator for resource allocation and health service planning. A clear relationship has been shown to exist between reported long-term illness and the demand for a range of medical services. The question will provide information on the circumstances in which the long-term sick live—for example, whether they live alone. It will also provide analysis by age, which will be useful as the number of elderly people increases. Therefore, the information will be set in the context of other information gained by the census.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heath</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The terms in which the Economic Secretary has now set out the question make perfect sense, but the order contains a much vaguer definition, which does not include whether one is prevented from working through illness. We need a more objective view of what the question constitutes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was about to say, the Office for National Statistics has tested the question and found that it produces the quality of information that will be useful in the context that I mentioned. Rigorous tests are applied to whether questions of this kind will yield the information that we want, and in some cases it has been difficult to find the right form. In this case we have found questions that result in useful information being gleaned,

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
so it is essential that this question should be in the census. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the information that we obtain from it will be useful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I have understood the Economic Secretary correctly, it would be in my constituents' interests to answer the question as if they were all hypochondriacs, to ensure that my area gets more finance for the NHS.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be true, but I trust that the hon. Gentleman will not advise his constituents to do that. As the census is used as a basis for resource allocation, a lot of information of this kind is gleaned. If the information given is false, it could lead to the results to which the hon. Gentleman referred, but work is also done in separate follow-up surveys to test the validity of the information that is received. The return is not the only sift that is used by the Office for National Statistics to produce the census information.<br><br>
The discussion of terminology in Wales by my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers) has left me with an insuperable problem. Clearly the words "bad in bed" and "bad in bed under the doctor" would have completely different connotations in England from those that they might have in Wales. I can only offer to think further about the problem, as it is not one to which I have an answer this afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rogers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The connotations to be put on those questions are the purest. Those of us who live in the south Wales valleys and are of strong Protestant descent would not think of applying wrong connotations to those simple questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Purity is probably greater in Wales than it could possibly be in England and elsewhere.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton asked how, particularly when data are reduced to a smaller level, people could be confident that they will not be identified. The basis of a census is that people should have confidence in the confidentiality of the data. If we did not have such confidence, there would be major problems with compliance. The information gathered would therefore be of no use to Government or to the many others who use, and, in some cases, buy the data.<br><br>
No identifiable information is passed or sold to any other organisation, and the data is not in an identifiable form. Measures will be taken to ensure that the risk of the output of identifiable information is minimised. We are considering the appropriate method of doing that, which will be subject to review. Confidentiality is of paramount importance, along with accuracy of data. Those are our two overriding concerns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that reassurance. However, the Committee should be told what those measures will be. The Minister said that measures were being considered. Will there be further discussion before the census is finalised, so that we may consider those measures? Alternatively, will the Minister write to Committee members to reassure them about those measures and their efficacy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Work is ongoing, and will continue for some time. Therefore, it would not necessarily be helpful
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
for me to offer to write to Committee members. The results are likely to be announced in Parliament at the end of this year. The House will therefore be informed about the necessary measures and safeguards. There are many Office for National Statistics officials in the Committee Room, and I am sure that they are listening keenly, as I am, to the hon. Gentleman's point, which will be borne fully in mind in our consideration.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about prosecutions for non-compliance. I have figures on successful prosecutions in the past three decades. In 1971, there were 424 successful prosecutions, in 1981, 692, and in 1991, 342. That is a patchy record, and the figure for the previous decade was the lowest for 20 or more years—I do not have pre-1971 figures. Clearly, neither the Government nor the authorities want to pursue people in such a way. Indeed, the hon. Member for West Dorset asked how religious and ethnic questions would be dealt with. I am sure that those concerns are being considered in another place. That will be discussed on the Floor of the House when the other place has finished its deliberations. We are sensitive to the issue of compliance; ideally, we would not prosecute anybody. Without compliance, however, the data will not be accurate or reliable. It is therefore important to ensure compliance. I am sure that prosecutions are pursued reluctantly and only where they are fully justified.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome raised the question of qualifications. Details on academic and vocational qualifications will be supplemented by data on selected professional qualifications. Data on teachers, doctors, dentists and nurses is supplemental to the other data, rather than an alternative. The data will be used to assess and monitor educational attainment and national learning targets, take-up of vocational qualifications and support for lifelong learning. Again, that will be valuable information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heath</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My precise point was whether that information was available more accurately and more conveniently from the professional registers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem with that is that we would not be able to identify where those people were to be found, in population terms, or other relevant issues. Indeed, some people with qualifications may not be working in their professions at that time. For example, we know that many people with nursing qualifications are not currently working. Some may not work because of back injuries, but there may be other reasons why qualified people are not working in their professions, such as looking after children.<br><br>
I was asked about the European convention on human rights, and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bosworth (Mr. Tredinnick), who is no longer in his place, for rescuing me in that regard. As far as we are concerned, the census is fully compliant with the requirements of the European convention on human rights. There is no problem with that, even though, as the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton rightly remarked, there is no formal requirement to sign a document in respect of a statutory instrument.<br><br>
The order, which is a very important provision, was somewhat complicated by the need to use the affirmative

resolution procedure and the negative resolution procedure. It will provide the single most important source of social statistics. This is a once-in-a-decade opportunity, and we have made some exciting additions to the questions in the census. The information that will be gathered will be even better than before, which will help the Government and other agencies to provide better
