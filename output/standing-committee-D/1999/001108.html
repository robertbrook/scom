Draft Companies Act 1985 (Electronic Communications) Order 2000</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce (Ms Patricia Hewitt)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Companies Act 1985 (Electronic Communications) Order 2000.</p></blockquote>
I am pleased that we are to debate today the first order to be introduced under section 8 of the Electronic Communications Act 2000. As this is the first order, I will, after describing its main provisions, take the opportunity to set out the Government's plans for further orders under section 8 of the Act.<br><br>
The draft order removes obstacles in the Companies Act 1985 to electronic communications between a company and its members. A number of provisions in the 1985 Act either require communications to be made in writing or, because they were drafted in the pre-electronic age, are unclear as to whether electronic means can be used. The order will cover three types of electronic communication: from companies to Companies House; from companies to their shareholders; and from shareholders to their company.<br><br>
The draft order will amend provisions in the 1985 Act that prevent the electronic delivery of certain documents to Companies House. Companies may already file some documents electronically, including the annual return, directors' details and a change of registered office. The order will allow new companies to incorporate electronically. It will also allow existing companies to re-register electronically when they are changing their status, for example changing from a private to a public company. The principal barrier in the 1985 Act to electronic communications for those transactions is the requirement that they be supported by a statutory declaration of compliance with the Act. As statutory declarations must be sworn before a solicitor or notary, they cannot be made electronically. Consequently, the draft order will replace them with statements, which can be made electronically. False statements will be as serious as false declarations, and will attract equivalent penalties.<br><br>
The order deals also with communications from a company to its members. Many companies already use websites to publish shareholder information. However, certain information that the Companies Act 1985 requires companies to send to shareholders must currently be sent by post in hard copy. Under the order, companies will be able to send that information by electronic communication to any shareholder who
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
agrees to receive it in that way. The information covered by the order is the annual report and accounts, summary financial statements and notices of general meetings. The order includes provision for that information to be published on a website, accompanied by a communication to members notifying them how to access the information. In addition, the draft order covers communications from a member to the company. Shareholders will be able to lodge proxies electronically, along with instructions on how the proxy should be exercised.<br><br>
In addition to the obstacles in the Companies Act 1985 that I have mentioned, the articles of association of companies may also impose barriers to electronic communications. The order provides that anything in a company's articles that would prevent it from taking advantage of the order is overridden. As required by section 8(6)(a) of the Electronic Communications Act 2000, the draft order is permissive. It enables, but does not require companies and shareholders to use electronic communications. So, for example, companies may continue to use traditional means to incorporate at Companies House. Electronic communications will be used between a company and an individual member only where both agree. In practice, a company may well communicate electronically with some of its members and by post with others who prefer paper copies or who do not have internet access.<br><br>
The order will require companies to ask their members to opt in to electronic communications, rather than to opt out. However, it leaves considerable flexibility for companies to decide on the best means of electronic communication, and the method for agreeing to it. Companies need that flexibility to accommodate their varying circumstances and to adapt to developments in technology. In that respect, guidance rather than legislation is appropriate. I welcome the initiative of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, which has prepared best practice guidance for companies that choose to take advantage of the order. That guidance will be of great assistance to companies and their shareholders. In accordance with the undertaking given by my right hon. Friend the Attorney-General last year, I confirm that in my view the amendments to the Companies Act 1985 proposed in the order are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.<br><br>
The order has been laid under the affirmative resolution procedure in accordance with the memorandum that I submitted to Parliament in January, in which I said that the Government envisaged that the first order would be subject to an affirmative resolution, but that other orders would usually be subject to the negative resolution.<br><br>
The Committee will wish to note that my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning proposes to lay an order later this month to amend the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 for the purpose of allowing electronic communication between the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and local authorities on housing reserve account subsidy determinations and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0091">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
decisions. As no major issues of principle are raised by the DETR order, my hon. Friend proposes to make it subject to the negative resolution procedure. That will enable it to come into force in time for the annual determination of housing revenue account subsidy. That order is likely to be made, and it could therefore come into force before this one.<br><br>
The order was widely welcomed by companies when it was issued for consultation earlier this year. Companies believe that it will assist them to reduce costs and to improve their communications with shareholders. The order is a good example of how section 8 of the Electronic Communications Act 2000 can be used to reduce burdens on companies and individuals while improving the service that they provide or receive.<br><br>
The main purpose of that Act is to help build confidence in electronic commerce. It does that by providing for an approval scheme for businesses and other organisations that provide cryptography services such as electronic signature and confidentiality services. It also provides for the legal recognition of electronic signatures, and the process under which they are verified, generated or communicated. However, section 8 crucially contains a power to remove obstacles in other legislation to the use of electronic communication and storage in place of paper. That power is a major element in delivering the Government's policy of promoting electronic commerce, and of meeting the targets for making Government services available electronically.<br><br>
The power in section 8 of the Act is extremely flexible in its application and, like most other provisions in the Act, it is technology-neutral. Together with the provision in section 7 for the legal recognition of electronic signatures, it has the potential to create a step-change in the effectiveness and efficiency of transactions between Government and citizens or business, and in business-to-business and business-to-customer transactions. An illustration of the potential benefit is the opportunity offered by the Inland Revenue this year, made under similar powers in the Finance Act 1999, for the on-line submission of tax returns. I have no doubt that many right hon. and hon. Members will have made good use of that facility.<br><br>
In his written answer of 24 May, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office stated the Government's priorities for making orders under section 8 of the Act. Those included the company law order now before the Committee. It also included orders to permit electronic conveyancing, to facilitate the electronic submission of trade statistics to the Office of National Statistics, to permit the electronic submission of a statutory off-road declaration of a vehicle, to allow the electronic authentication of public records for court proceedings, and to give legal recognition to the official legislation website version of statutes.<br><br>
Earlier this year, in a written answer on 28 July, I said that a further order was likely to allow the electronic submission of information by oil companies under the Petroleum Act 1998 and the consequent
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
electronic delivery of consents and approvals by the Secretary of State. In the UK Online Report published in September, the Government accepted a commitment to remove 70 per cent. of identified regulatory and legal barriers to electronic ways of working in the UK by the end of 2001, and 100 per cent. by the end of 2002. We are on target to achieve that aim.<br><br>
The orders that I have mentioned are not the only ones to have been identified. The Office of the e-Envoy in the Cabinet Office has worked with the information age Government champions in each Department to review other potential candidates for section 8 orders. In accordance with the Government's commitment, given in their response to the Trade and Industry Committee's recent report on the Electronic Communications Bill, we shall be publishing details within two years—that is by the end of next year—of all the statutory definitions of words such as "writing" and "signature" that need to be updated to take account of electronic communications.<br><br>
Departments are in discussion with trade associations and other interested bodies to seek their views on the priorities for other section 8 orders. One possibility is the amendment of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 to allow consumer credit agreements to be concluded on-line. The Finance and Leasing Association raised that proposal with my Department, and we are discussing it with the association and other interested parties.<br><br>
The Act is bringing the statute book into the 21st century. This order is the first of many that will enable Government, businesses and citizens to reap the full benefits of information technology and I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.40 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Duncan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rutland and Melton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: By and large, this is an easy order, because it fits in with the issues that the Committee debated at length during the passage of the Electronic Communications Act 2000. The measure before us follows from the passage of that Act. This is a rare moment: if the details are properly implemented, they should result in fewer, rather than greater, burdens on business. Of course that is our policy. New Labour pretends that that is its policy, but does not always implement it with the zeal that we would like.<br><br>
The direction of the order is exactly in line with our policy for business. However, I shall revisit the theme of many comments that I made during the passage of the Electronic Communications Act 2000 and the Postal Services Act 2000—on which I also led in Committee—by saying that the order is a cumbersome way of expressing in law and on paper what we want to achieve. If only we could, cross party, persuade the draftsmen sensibly to put on paper what we wanted to achieve, we would be much further forward. I pity any lawyer or anyone who has to pay a lawyer to interpret so many pages of gobbledegook that change a few Acts of Parliament to allow electronic signature and the electronic transfer of information. If that is the state of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0092">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
our democracy and law, we are in a pretty pitiful state. The simplification and easy expression in language of an uncontroversial objective should be much easier.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will say more about safeguards and the verification of information that travels through cyberspace to establish that the person communicating with a company or any other organisation is proper and authorised and the representative opinion of the person pretending to send the information. What safeguards have been established? Following on from our debates before Christmas, during the passage of the legislation, what system has emerged through private effort or been set up by the Minister to ensure that whatever appears on someone's screen is the transmission of the pretended authorised person.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister can explain what she meant about the DETR order. She read from her script faithfully, but my expression matched hers in its bemusement. I am not sure whether it was a resolution or a revolution; I could not fathom exactly what she was on about. The Committee would be much enlightened by an explanation.<br><br>
What is the current status of the e-envoy? He is responsible for the issues under discussion. I recognise and compliment Alex Allen, the former e-envoy, although I have suspicions about the hybrid status of anyone appointed as an envoy or Tsar. His status is somewhere between that of a Minister and that of a civil servant, with no properly understood authority in our constitution. I accept that Mr. Allen probably did a good job and I am sorry that he has had to move on for personal reasons, but I do not think that the position of e-envoy has been advertised or appointed. It has not been sent to me in a press release. As there has been no statement in the House, will the Minister tell the Committee the status of the appointment, what the appointee will be charged to do, how the job will be done and what will be the nature of the contract?<br><br>
If the Minister wants to enter into the spirit of the statutory instrument, she should make a firm pledge that within a fortnight—I will give her three weeks—her Department will issue press releases by e-mail, as it is the only one that does not do so at present. She is supposed to be the e-commerce Minister, but every day her Department churns out bog rolls of facts, and the most fatuous press releases of all time—that is another matter—and refuses to send them electronically, much as I have tried to persuade it to do otherwise. Will the Minister tell me why?<br><br>
What will the Government do to match the standards and the opportunities that the measure sets for businesses? We were told in a great advertising campaign a few weeks ago that we could file our tax returns electronically in return for £10—a nice, dinky little bribe—only to be told two weeks later that the system had collapsed and we could no longer do so. What is the status of all Departments in matching the electronic standards set in the proposal?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
I shall make one further observation, which is important to the future workings of the House and its Committees. I sat through most of yesterday's debate on the so-called modernisation of the House of Commons. I listened to all the speeches carefully, with an open mind, and I grew to respect the hon. Member for Dudley, South (Mr. Pearson), who made an excellent speech about the guillotine on the permanent programming of our proceedings. I also had to listen to the hon. Member for Rochdale (Lorna Fitzsimons), and now I have to watch her doing her correspondence when she is supposed to be enhancing the scrutiny of Parliament. Her paper, it seems, is as blank as her mind. I am sorry that her comments in yesterday's debate do not match her conduct today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lorna Fitzsimons <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rochdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir David. Our conduct in debate should be an example to the outside world, and it is not incumbent on the hon. Gentleman to act as judge and jury without his having scrutinised my activities. The papers that I am scrutinising are not correspondence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see nothing out of order.</span></p>
<p>4.48 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian Cotter <span class='memberconstituency'>(Weston-super-Mare)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for calling me, Sir David. I shall make a few brief comments. First, I welcome the proposal and the Minister's statement that it is part and parcel of putting Government on-line. I cannot remember the percentage that the Government expect will be on-line next year, but I hope that they are on course to achieve their aim. Indeed, the process should be stepped up.<br><br>
Changes at Companies House requiring communications to be made electronically will affect small and medium enterprises, but such changes will not happen for some time. They should be made in a reasonable manner, with appropriate notice and with the appreciation that some small enterprises may be unable to adopt electronic means of communication.<br><br>
The best practice guidance will be most welcome; I hope that the new procedure will not be set in stone, but will be open to revision in the light of experience. Consultation has taken place on best practice guidance and other matters. I make a gentle inquiry rather than a criticism. Is the Minister happy or worried that only 39 responses were received to the consultation? Was the order sufficiently advertised? That seems a small number of responses given that they were not all official and that some were from individuals. Did enough individuals know about the proposal? Like the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan), I would be interested in learning a little more about the e-envoy.</span></p>
<p>4.50 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lorna Fitzsimons <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rochdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members laugh, but will my hon. Friend the Minister comment further on the systematic lack of investment under the previous Administration in the Department of Trade and Industry, which left our Government with so much to recover? Like many Back Benchers, I welcome correspondence with many exporters and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0093">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
companies that rely on the DTI's services about the effect that the lack of investment under the previous Administration had on the business community that Opposition Members profess to care so much about. Perhaps the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton should not complain so much about his faxes. Such attacks bring this place into disrepute by personalising matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'> rose—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady giving way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lorna Fitzsimons</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I have finished.</span></p>
<p>4.52 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond briefly to the interesting points that have been made in the debate, most—although regrettably not all—of which has been courteously conducted.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton said that the order was too complicated. I sympathise, having made precisely that point. Unfortunately, however, there is a good—or bad—reason why it is so complicated. It amends lots of different provisions that are scattered through a complex measure—the Companies Act 1985. In 1985, it was not our party but the hon. Gentleman's party that was in power and responsible for drafting the original measure. I would love to have simpler drafting, and we shall continue to pursue that holy grail. Unfortunately, however, to revise accurately a complex measure and ensure that the changes are coherent and can be followed, at least by the legally minded reader, a longer order is sometimes necessary than might in theory have been desirable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister intend to publish, or is a system in place, for properly publishing, a composite amended and updated version of current law so that people do not have to cross-reference the order to previous Acts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That need will be met by the guidance from the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, to which I referred earlier. However, I accept the point about the need for a consolidated statement of the legislation complete with these amendments and any others that have been made in the meantime.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about authentication of electronic communications. For communications between companies and Companies House, the registrar already has a system for ensuring that electronically delivered information is properly authenticated, and, depending on the nature of the signature requirement, documents are authenticated with either a confidential pre-arranged digital code or an individual code that comprises selected elements of personal data. That authentication system in place at Companies House will continue to apply to the new documents and information sent to Companies House under the order.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain the process by which if an electronic alternative is permissible, the paper copy will no longer be necessary? For instance, how, in the filing of a company's accounts or its obligation to send an annual report, is it acceptable in law to send an electronic version, thereby rendering unnecessary the paper alternative?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I follow the hon. Gentleman's point. We anticipate that some shareholders will continue to want paper copies of information, so their companies will continue to make such copies available. I think that that deals with the hon. Gentleman's point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the moment, companies employ other companies to deal with the filing of their accounts and the distribution of documents relating to scrip or share issues. Many companies are not equipped to keep up with the electronic age in the manner required by the order. Is there a proper system in law for registering that shareholders or potential subscribers to a share issue have elected to receive the information electronically? Such a decision will relieve the company of the expense of the obligation to send it on paper. How will the distinction be measured in law?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I dealt with that point in my opening statement. The Companies Act 1985 contains no provision to compel any individual to receive electronic documentation, so there no danger of a company excluding somebody who wishes or needs to continue to receive information in paper form by making it available only electronically. We have covered this ground pretty thoroughly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If someone has exercised the option to receive it electronically, what is the mechanism by which a company is released from the existing legal obligation to send the information on paper?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what the order does, by removing the Companies Act obligations to send the information on paper in all circumstances. I am not prepared to waste any more time on this point. If the hon. Gentleman wants to write to me about it, I shall be happy to reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir David. The issues under discussion are highly important. The legislation may be permissive, or it might do something different. This is not merely a petty debating point. There is a clear distinction between stating in law that it is legitimate for a company to send information electronically and saying that that is a substitute for other requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has described her course of action within the confines of the debate and I do not think that she has given way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Sir David. I have said several times that the order provides for shareholders to elect to receive electronic information from the company in which they have invested. If they do not elect to receive it electronically, they will continue to be entitled under the Companies Act to receive it on

paper. I do not think that there is anything confusing about that point, which I made precisely earlier in the debate.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton referred to security in communications between companies and individuals. He asked how the individual shareholder could be assured that information was genuine and had come from the company in which he or she invested. The guidance prepared by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators sets out best practice that will enable companies to provide to shareholders a reliable service that also complies with the requirements of company law. That guidance will offer practical help to companies on the procedures that are necessary for electronic communications and clarification of the communications received—an arrangement that parallels the procedures already in place in relation to Companies House.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the immensely interesting issue of the DETR order. I should like to draw the Committee's attention to a purely technical point in that respect. In our proceedings on the Bill that became the Electronic Communications Act 2000, I undertook that the first section 8 order would be subject to the affirmative action procedure. The order is the first to be laid under section 8. As I said, a further order will be laid later this month by my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing, Planning and Construction. However, because that order needs to come into effect rapidly to deal with this year's returns for the housing revenue account, the DETR order is likely to be the first one made under the Act. That is a small technical distinction, but I wanted to assure the Committee that I had complied with my undertaking.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Rutland and Melton and for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) raised the issue of the e-envoy. I echo the remarks made about Alex Allen, the first e-envoy, who provided superb leadership in his role as the lead official in Whitehall on matters to do with e-government. Following his sad departure, his place has temporarily been filled by Andrew Pinder, a former civil servant. Before he took up the post, he served as a consultant to Departments for some years. The post was advertised several weeks ago in, I think, <i>The Sunday Times.</i> I am happy to send the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton a copy of the advertisement if that will keep him happy. We have had many expressions of interest in the post, so we shall proceed as rapidly as possible with the appointment and it will be announced in due course.<br><br>
We offer an e-mail service for press releases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We certainly do. I have checked that with my press office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why then not to me?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will pass me a note of his e-mail address, which I am afraid that I do not have in my head, I will ensure through the press office that he receives press notices. As far as I know,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
we post all our press releases on the website, so he can easily access them, but we can add him to our e-mail list.<br><br>
We have made great progress relating to the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise to ensure that individuals and businesses can file a variety of returns electronically. The hon. Gentleman might have the grace to accept that in most large organisations, whether private or public sector, it is rare for sizeable new IT roll-outs not to have occasional teething problems. The Inland Revenue leads the world in the adoption of XML protocols that will enable the easy transfer of information about income tax and other matters between it, businesses and accountants. I welcome that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare raised other issues. We shall keep under review the impact of the order and, working with the institute, the impact of the guidance. If a need emerges either for further changes to the Companies Act 1985 or for clarification in the guidance, we will of course ensure that we provide what is needed. The hon. Gentleman also asked whether we were satisfied with the number of responses. It is the quality that counts, not the quantity, and our responses raised several detailed issues in what is, as I said earlier, a complex area of company law. We considered the issues thoroughly, and discussed them with several of the associations concerned to satisfy ourselves that the draft order as laid today met our intention to enable electronic communications between shareholders, their companies and Companies House. We have achieved that intention, so I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for explaining many of the issues that I raised. However, there are still some inadequacies in her answers. I am pleased to hear her say that the e-envoy is an official, but regret that she could not properly define what the distinction is between an official and a Minister these days. Now, officials tend to go around seeking publicity. The clear distinction between the civil servant and the Minister has been lost. Similarly, the clear distinction between the civil servant's obligations and a Minister's accountability has also been lost, so there is a complete mixture between the two. By and large, when the Government are in trouble, they will either bounce their obligation to curious creatures in the House of Lords or to officials who are far less to blame than the Ministers who govern their affairs.<br><br>
We have not received a proper answer to the question whether the Government will properly implement this sort of discipline. When the Minister says that our system of filing tax returns has become a leading example to the world, I feel sorry for the world. The experiment was full of big words, but subsequently full of failure. Those who were offered 10 quid to file their returns by computer found that they could not remit them by e-mail or any other electronic means to Inland Revenue—simply because the Revenue could not cope. The Minister's parallel Department invited people to meet the standard that she is parading, but they were unable to meet it.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0095">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
Most importantly, I have not had an answer to the most crucial question posed by the statutory instrument. We entirely understand that it allows—and we fully support that—the transmission of information by electronic means. That applies to a company report, the filing of share registration and other such matters that engage all sorts of companies. If we can replace paper with well authorised and verified electronic information, we are all for it: it is less burdensome, cheaper and more efficient.<br><br>
The Minister, however, has not yet answered this question. Whereas the statutory instrument allows those developments, at what point is a replacement of the existing obligation to use paper triggered so that a company no longer has to meet that legal obligation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will answer me when I have finished my question. Under current Committee procedures—though the hon. Member for Rochdale may not approve—the Minister has the last word.<br><br>
To what extent does the instrument provide a parallel opportunity; or is it a direct replacement whose point of replacement can be properly established in law? Does the receipt by a company in a properly recorded form of a verifying code or signature represent the trigger that allows that company to be relinquished from its obligation to send a glossy, and do it instead through e-mail? Or is some other legal point involved?<br><br>
I believe that the Minister understands the point because I can see her nodding. Some companies may be liable under existing law and want to be certain that, following the passage of this measure, they will not have to duplicate in order not to be liable under the old system. At what point is a company's legal liability fully relinquished so that if it operates electronically there will be no comeback in law to the effect that it should also have complied with current legislation? That is the key point. For every glossy—whether it relates to an annual report, a share offer or whatever—companies can be saved a fiver or a tenner. They must be clear about the point at which they are clear of legal
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
comeback. If the Minister could clarify that in Committee, it would be more helpful to any company than the exact wording of the provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret to tell the hon. Gentleman that the precise answer to his question depends on the specific wording of the amendment in the order in relation to each of the relevant sections of the Companies Act. The simple answer is that when a shareholder notifies a company of his or her desire to receive, say, an annual report by electronic means rather than the more expensive glossy paper version, it triggers the acceptability in law of the company sending that information electronically.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister allow me a short intervention?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not give away again. I have tried to deal—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then we will vote against the order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Either the Minister gives way or she does not. It is not up to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way one final time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Duncan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. What exactly constitutes notification?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The shareholder will need to provide the company with an e-mail address to which electronic information can be sent. The company may wish to specify verification procedures—an issue that I have already touched on in response to the hon. Gentleman. It is really for the company and shareholders to agree on a process should they wish to do so. Individual companies can do that and the guidance to which I have referred gives companies the information that they need about what will be regarded as best practice. That will be fully compliant with the Companies Act as amended by this order.</span></p>
