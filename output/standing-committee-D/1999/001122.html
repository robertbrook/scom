Double Taxation Orders</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Double Taxation Relief (Shipping Transport) (Hong Kong) Order 2000.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxation on Income) (Norway) Order 2000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly introduce the two orders. First, however, I welcome the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) to his new post in the shadow Treasury team. I welcome him to our happy little band, and I look forward to debating with him the various finance matters that we shall be called upon to consider during the coming year. I hope that we shall be able to do so in the good-spirited yet probing and direct manner of his predecessor.<br><br>
I am pleased to introduce the two double taxation orders. The order relating to Norway deals with the new, comprehensive convention that replaces the existing one. The order relating to the Hong Kong special administrative region of the People's Republic of China is a limited agreement dealing with profits from the business of international shipping. Both were concluded recently.<br><br>
Double taxation treaties are welcomed by the business community as an aid to international trade and investment. The main aim is to relieve double taxation when income from one country goes to a resident of another and is taxable in both countries. In order achieve that, each country agrees to limit its taxing rights and to give credit for the other country's tax. Tax treaties also help businesses to plan their investments by providing certainty about their tax treatment. They also provide for an exchange of information and consultation between the two tax authorities to try to resolve difficult cases by mutual agreement.<br><br>
We are committed to maintaining and developing the United Kingdom's network of double taxation treaties. We have more than 100 bilateral tax treaties, the largest network of double taxation treaties in the world. We recently began our annual round of consultation, in which we invited the business community and other interested parties to let us know their priorities for new and updated treaties, in order to take advantage of changes in international trade and in taxation systems. We shall take those views into account when planning future programmes.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Norway is a substantial trading partner of the United Kingdom. We have a shared interest in the continued development of North sea oil and gas resources. The new double taxation convention with Norway will replace the existing one, which was concluded in 1985. In many respects, the new convention follows the rules set out in the existing convention, but there have been some changes in policy and legislation in both countries since 1985, and we have agreed that it was right that the convention should be updated.<br><br>
One change is that Norwegian residents will no longer be entitled to the UK tax credits on dividends. From April 1999, the value of the tax credit was reduced as part of our corporate tax reform. In practice, Norwegian investors no longer receive cash payments in respect of the tax credit under the terms of the present convention. The new convention also has a more effective anti-avoidance provision. Other changes reflect the adoption by Norway of the credit method of relieving double taxation. In relation to oil and gas development, the convention provides new rules for taxation of future cross-border development of the UK-Norway oil and gas fields that do away with the need to amend the convention on each occasion.<br><br>
The draft order for the Hong Kong special administrative region of the People's Republic of China will give effect to the first double taxation agreement relating to international shipping transport to be made between the Governments of the United Kingdom and of the Hong Kong special administrative region. The agreement, which was signed on 25 October, complements a similar provision relating to international air transport, which was included as part of the air services agreement between the two Governments. You may recall, Mr. Hancock, although it did not immediately spring to my mind, that the air transport provision was considered by this Committee in 1998. The Order in Council that gave effect to it was made by Her Majesty in Council on 21 October that year.<br><br>
The agreement provides an exemption in one territory for profits derived by an enterprise of the other territory from the business of international shipping transport. The exemption also applies to profits from participation in a joint business, gains from the alienation of ships and movable property, and capital represented by such ships and property. It is welcomed by the United Kingdom shipping industry and represents good progress in the smooth operations between the two territories.</span></p>
<p>4.36 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Clappison <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon, Mr. Hancock. The measure that we are debating is a short one and although several questions arise, they will take up an inordinate time.<br><br>
I thank the Paymaster General for her kind personal remarks and for the briefing that was extended to me by her office, involving representatives of the Inland
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0100">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
Revenue. I found it a most helpful innovation. I understand that it began under the previous Government and it helps the process of scrutiny.<br><br>
The Paymaster General questioned whether the Committee could be said to be a happy band. Well, we are few, but whether we are a happy band of brothers I know not. I am not sure that it is the Opposition's responsibility to make the Government happier than they happen to be at any time, but I can tell the Paymaster General that we do not intend to oppose the order. We support, in principle, double taxation treaties. They bring important benefits to this country and enjoy the general support of the business community. The previous Government were responsible for some notable and important additions to the United Kingdom network of double taxation treaties. Indeed, the Paymaster General mentioned that this country is party to more than 100 such treaties—one of the most extensive such networks in the world—and the 100th treaty was concluded under the previous Government. The Conservative party continues to support the development of the network of United Kingdom treaties on double taxation.<br><br>
I shall discuss the order relating to Norway first. The treaty is not a new one, but replaces the treaty that was concluded in 1985. I have consulted the parliamentary record with respect to that treaty and note that it does not seem to have taken up a great deal of time. The then Opposition spokesman seems not to have seen the need to scrutinise the double taxation treaty at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Luff <span class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Worcestershire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who was it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must resist the temptation to respond to that question. Perhaps other hon. Members will discover the interesting details later. Clearly, however, the spokesman was completely satisfied with the way in which the Government of the day had negotiated the double taxation treaty, and did not see fit to ask any questions about it.<br><br>
Since the conclusion of the treaty in 1985, the economic relationship between the United Kingdom and Norway has been strong. As the Paymaster General pointed out, Norway is an important trading partner for the UK, especially in relation to the size of its population. Last year, it was the UK's 15th largest export market, and recently Norwegian inward investment in the UK has been growing, reaching a peak in 1997 and falling back since. It would be interesting to know the most recent figures for Norwegian inward investment in the UK, as the order will influence them, but I do not know whether the Paymaster General has the information. Recently, Norway has invested more in the UK than some other Scandinavian countries, including Denmark and Finland, and apparently even more than some important members of the European Union, such as Italy or Spain. Anything that affects the economic relationship between Norway and the UK must receive proper scrutiny.<br><br>
I propose to ask several questions concerning significant differences between the old and new treaties. Article 10 relates to tax credits on the payment of dividends. Under the old treaty, a resident of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
Norway was entitled to receive a tax credit in respect of dividend receipts when a UK resident was entitled to receive a tax credit, but such provisions have been deleted from the new order. Will the Paymaster General confirm that that is a consequence of the Chancellor's decision in his first Budget to abolish tax credits for non-residents, alongside the abolition of credits for pension funds and UK residents who are non-taxpayers? We all know about the long-term consequences of that decision for UK pension funds and how UK resident non-taxpayers have been deprived of their tax credit. Under the new provisions, Norwegian residents will be deprived of the tax credit as well, as the Paymaster General accepts. Will she confirm that one of the policy reasons for such a tax credit was the connection to inward investment? Does she think that inward investment will be increased or decreased as a result of the measure?<br><br>
Under article 13 of the new treaty, there is a noticeable change to the taxation of capital gains on the disposal of shares. In the old treaty, capital gains liability due to gains derived by a resident of one contracting state from the disposal of shares in a company in the other state arose when more than 25 per cent. of the shares in the company were disposed of, and when the majority of the company's property was in the other state. Under article 13(6), gains derived by an individual resident in a contracting state from the disposal of shares in a company resident in the other state may be taxed in the other state only if he has been resident in the other state at any time during the previous six years. That change is noticeable, going from a test based on the proportion of shares in a company owned by an individual and the location of the majority of the company's property, to a test based on length of residence. Will the Paymaster General explain that?<br><br>
Article 13(2) is an addition. It provides that gains by a resident of a contracting state resulting from the disposal of shares or other forms of interest that derive their value from immovable property in the other state may be taxed in the other state. One imagines that that is some form of anti-avoidance provision to reinforce the provisions in the old treaty. Will the Paymaster General confirm whether that is the case? If it is not, will she tell us why the addition has been made? I refer to new paragraph (2) in article 13, which deals with capital gains on snares or other forms of interest deriving their value from immovable property in one of the contracting states.<br><br>
Article 17 of the new treaty deals with "Artistes and Sportsmen". Since the treaty with Norway was concluded in 1985, several Norwegian football players have enriched English and Scottish professional football. One thinks of players of the calibre of Eric Bakke of Leeds United or even, possibly, Tore Andre Flo. Under this treaty they are described as sportsmen, which is a stylistic change, because in 1985 they were described as athletes. Will the Paymaster General confirm whether the tax treatment of Norwegian sportsmen or women or artistes remains the same as in 1985?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0101">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
The new treaty contains new provisions relating to Frigg field. One of the most important features of the double taxation agreement with Norway is that it—</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to mention the importance of the North sea oil and gas fields in the relationship between the United Kingdom and Norway. The existing treaty contains provisions relating to a number of such oil and gas fields such as the Statfjord field and Murchison field reservoirs. In article 27, the new treaty also includes the Frigg field in the ambit of the double taxation agreement for the first time. I should like the Paymaster General to say something about that, if only because there is an element of retrospection in it and any such element must be justified, however worthy it may turn out to be. Under article 27(4), the provisions of article 24 apply in the UK as from 1 April 1998. That is a retrospective measure and we should like to hear from the Paymaster General about the reason for that.<br><br>
It would also be helpful to hear about the Friggfield itself—how much of it is under Norwegian jurisdiction and how much under UK jurisdiction? Will the Paymaster General confirm whether the same general approach is taken towards that field as is taken towards the others, which were already part of the existing double taxation agreement? Are there any differences and if so, what do they amount to? I must confess that, looking at the document, I could not immediately detect any. However, the Paymaster General will be able to assist us with that. I am sure that the Committee would like to hear what the differences are between the approaches and the reasons for those differences.<br><br>
Unlike the order relating to Norway, the Double Taxation Relief (Shipping Transport) (Hong Kong) Order 2000 is a completely new treaty that relates only to shipping. It would be interesting if, to set the scene, the Paymaster General would tell us how much shipping business is carried on by UK firms in Hong Kong. I am sure that she will have considered that, given that the measure is concerned with the shipping transport provided by UK companies in Hong Kong.<br><br>
According to the explanatory note the agreement will come into force when each party has completed certain procedures, but it does not tell us what those procedures are or when they might be completed. Will the Paymaster General give some indication of when the agreement will come into force? As she said, there is already an air services agreement between the UK and Hong Kong, but that agreement, together with the shipping agreement, does not amount to a comprehensive double taxation agreement between the UK and the Hong Kong SAR. We were told, in a press release from the Inland Revenue on 2 May, that there were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<br><blockquote><p>plans for exploratory talks about new or updated treaties with Hong Kong and a number of other nations.</p></blockquote>
Will the Paymaster General tell us when those talks are due to commence and how the present agreement will fit into the framework of a broader double taxation agreement? Will she give us some indication of their time scale? It would be of interest if she would also tell us about work in progress on double taxation agreements in general.<br><br>
Finally, in early drafts for the forthcoming intergovernmental conference, it is proposed that the Council of Ministers shall adopt measures to co-ordinate the provisions of member states to prevent discrimination and double taxation, and that it shall do so under a system of qualified majority voting. That is obviously relevant to this and future orders, and it will be useful to know from the Paymaster General the Government's approach to the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Luff</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been worrying throughout the debate. My hon. Friend said that, in 1985, similar orders were not scrutinised effectively. Given that he has been a model scrutineer today, he owes it to the Committee to identify which individual failed in his duty in Committee on that occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was merely, in my modest way, making the point that such matters were not controversial. Nor are they controversial now. We are not opposing the orders, but several questions must be asked. If my hon. Friend is so keen to find out the hon. Member involved, the record will show that the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair) was leading for the Opposition on such matters at that time.</span></p>
<p>5.5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the last point first. The present Government take the view as they did when they were in Opposition that double taxation treaties are extremely important when facilitating international trade, the smooth running of the tax system and the stability of our companies when deciding their investment in future years. We have always approached double taxation treaty debates in a non-partisan way and we think that that represents the best interests of the country. At the time, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister was setting an important precedent, which was that if one has nothing to say, do not waste parliamentary time by filling up the allotted time. The treaty in 1985 was excellent and it is now. It just shows how well my right hon. Friend got to grips with the technical details in the previous treaty in that he had no questions to ask. He was completely comfortable with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that we have covered that matter. For one moment I wondered whether the hon. Lady was about to demand a deoxyribonucleic acid test.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot think why I should do that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked several questions about Norway and Hong Kong. He was absolutely correct about payable credits and was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0102">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
referring to their removal under the previous treaty following the corporate tax review and restructuring undertaken by the Government. Part of the reason for that review was to support and encourage the continuing, strong investment in the United Kingdom. Those changes were widely welcomed by international business, and the consequent changes in other areas of international taxation resulted in helping companies in the smooth running of their business.<br><br>
The second set of questions asked by the hon. Member for Hertsmere concerned capital gains and the ability to tax former residents. In general, gains from the sale of shares are to be taxed solely in the seller's country of residence. However, it is recognised that that is inappropriate in certain circumstances, for example, when an individual builds up his own company and then moves to a treaty partner country before selling it. The usual treaty provisions would prevent the gain from being taxed in the individual's former country of residence. The provision included in the 1985 treaty reflected Norway's wish to prevent individuals from avoiding its charge on gains when they had substantial holdings in a Norwegian company.<br><br>
The provisions in the new convention reflect both the United Kingdom and the Norwegian wishes. They preserve our domestic rights over people who cease to be UK residents for treaty purposes but remain ordinarily resident in the UK under our domestic law or who are absent from the UK for less than five years. The measure takes account of the changes that have been made in both systems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Paymaster General for giving way and for her helpful elucidation. However, has she not just made the case that the people whom the parties want to tax are those who have built up a share in a company? Is she not making a good case for the provision in the original treaty rather than the one in this treaty, which sets a test according not to the size of the company but to the length of time that the person has been with the company? Will the provision not catch people who sell much smaller shareholdings in companies that they have not built up, which might constitute only a small share of the company?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman is not correct. Treaties never override domestic law. They cannot remove legislation in domestic law. The provisions ensure that a person is taxed appropriately in one or another of the territories. That is the purpose of double taxation. If the hon. Gentleman wants an assurance that as a result of the proposal people will be taxed more somewhere else or taxed unfairly, I cannot give that to him. The changes merely reflect the changes that have been made in Norwegian and UK legislation since that date.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the anti-abuse provision in article 13, which provides that gains on immovable property may be taxed in the state in which the property is situated. Paragraph (2) ensures that a taxpayer cannot circumvent that provision by purchasing and disposing of immovable property
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
indirectly via a company partnership or trust. It is a departure from the standard Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development provisions, but it is sanctioned by the OECD and recognised as necessary. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is part of the anti-avoidance mechanism designed to prevent that rule from being circumvented.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned Frigg field.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about footballers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, I forgot footballers, sportsmen and women and artistes. The point perplexed me, but I am reliably informed by my officials that there is no change in terms of the previous treaty, and the strong and happy relationships that have existed between Norway and the UK in terms of sportsmen and women can continue as previously.<br><br>
Frigg field is almost exhausted, but both countries want to use the infrastructure for the exploitation of other fields in the vicinity, for instance in the transmission of gas from other fields via Frigg field. To that end, the UK and Norway signed an amendment to the agreement relating to the exploitation of Frigg field in August 1998. That agreement specifically allowed the infrastructure to be used for gas from fields other than Frigg field. To ensure that the convention reflected that change in use, the provision relating to Frigg field was backdated to the year in which the new Frigg agreement was signed. The provision is designed to bring the law in line with an agreement to ensure the efficient use of that infrastructure for exploitation elsewhere.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked how many shipping companies operate in Hong Kong and what was the scale of their business. Five major UK shipping enterprises currently operate in Hong Kong, including tanker operators and container companies. I cannot name them, and I hope that he will not ask me to do so. Their 1999 receipts in Hong Kong amounted to £72 million.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked when the order is to come into force. I do not know the exact date. An endorsement process takes place here and in Hong Kong, but I can certainly find out about it and I shall happily write to him. He also wanted to know why there was no comprehensive tax treaty. That reflects the special status of Hong Kong. We have a comprehensive tax treaty with China, but Hong Kong has its own tax system and we have determined, in contemplating discussions and negotiations on future treaty programmes, that we should consider whether wider tax treaties are necessary. We shall take into account the views of professional organisations and companies, and respond to perceived problems.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about future negotiations. Discussions are continuing with several countries, including the United States, France, Canada and South Africa. The timing of the signing of the new conventions or protocols will of course depend on when the negotiations are concluded. However, at that point such items are always laid before the House of Commons for proper scrutiny within the parliamentary process.<br><br>

I did not quite understand the relevance to this debate of the hon. Gentleman's point about qualified majority voting. Double taxation treaties are bilateral agreements. We consider them, as the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged, extremely important and we continue to negotiate them bilaterally to facilitate trade and business. Nothing is on the horizon that would undermine, change or stop that process.<br><br>
I hope that I have dealt with all the points that the hon. Gentleman raised. If, when I scrutinise the record, I see that I have not done so, I shall of course write to him about any remaining points.</span></p>
<p>5.17 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I do not want to deal with matters of too technical a nature at this stage and I appreciate the explanations that the Paymaster General has given.<br><br>
Perhaps the Paymaster General could reflect further on the point about capital gains after she has had the opportunity to look at the record. She said that the provision was intended to deal with anyone who built up a capital stake in a company in one country and then went to another country to avoid capital gains liability. The provision would work only if the person in question had been resident for more than six years in another country. People who built up a company in less than six years would not be affected, although they would have been caught under existing provisions, which relate to the size of the company. In these technological days a substantial company can be built up, if not overnight, certainly very quickly. If the test is to be changed from company size to period of residence it will be possible for people who build up
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
companies quickly to escape capital gains liability. Perhaps the Paymaster General will reconsider that matter and write to me.<br><br>
I asked—although I do not want to make too much of it—about Hong Kong and the possibility of future agreements which, according to press announcements by the Paymaster General, may be on the horizon. Any future general agreement with Hong Kong would depend on who was negotiating with respect to double taxation. It may not have appeared in the Paymaster General's radar, but proposals are being made at the intergovernmental conference for such matters to be dealt with by the Council of Ministers in Europe on a qualified majority vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General shakes her head, but that is in a draft that I have here of early proposals for that conference, and I was merely seeking to find out from her what was the Government's approach to the matter. We have not really had a response from the Paymaster General. It is obviously relevant as far as these and other double taxation agreements are concerned, whether they are dealt with on a bilateral basis or whether they are part of a competence that is ceded to Europe to be dealt with on a qualified majority voting basis.</span></p>
