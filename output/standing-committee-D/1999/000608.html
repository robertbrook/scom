Education (Student Support) (Amendment) Regulations 2000</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Education (Student Support) (Amendment) Regulations 2000 (S.I., 2000, No. 1120).</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Education (Student Support) Regulations 2000 (S.I., 2000, No. 1121).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Should the Under-Secretary not move a motion? You must forgive me for asking that question, Sir David—one occasionally gets caught up in a procedural incoherence. It is probably as a result of long experience in Standing Committee that one expects Ministers to move more amendments than one moves oneself.<br><br>
I am reminded of a maxim that was advertised during the Vietnam war as a serious strategy for the United States Government: declare that one has won and terminate the war. On the material issue of the regulations, we could fairly claim that we have won a significant point, and I give the Under-Secretary fair credit for listening to us. His concession is a considerable advance and itself justifies our proceedings. Although my understanding of the complexities is perhaps imperfect, I shall explain the way in which he has conceded.<br><br>
One of our major concerns relates to the point that, until now, mortgage interest relief at source has been regarded as a permitted deduction against income for the purposes of calculating the student support package. By withdrawing that relief a year in advance of withdrawing MIRAS, the Government acted in a manner that was not exactly consistent. The Under-Secretary might want to discuss the matter when he explains his proposals, but my understanding is that some people would have been disadvantaged by those arrangements. As I hope to point out in my remarks, which will not be extended, there may be wider implications for the tuning and fit of student support regulations with tax regulations. The Under-Secretary might want to comment on that as well, but we should acknowledge that a useful concession has been made, and move on.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary will remember another debate, in which I introduced in a somewhat different context the concept of the Under-Secretary as a one-legged Santa Claus. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am sorry to see that the Government Whip is so distressed by that image. The Under-Secretary has not made a comparable concession in respect of withdrawing the allowable deduction against certain insurance
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
premiums, and I see no reason why one concession should be made but not the other. Perhaps there is no real effect, or no one is disadvantaged, but if the principle of no detriment applies to MIRAS, I would have expected it to apply to insurance contributions. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will explain.<br><br>
As Frankie Howerd would have said, let us move to the prologue. These regulations, particularly No. 1121 of 2000 and the supplementary regulations, are substantive and important, as are the amendments to the regulations that the Under-Secretary is trying to introduce. I concede that they are not formally before the Committee, but I doubt whether we shall want to create difficulties about them, given the concession that the Under-Secretary announced.<br><br>
If for no other reason, the complexity of the student support regulations makes them deserving of a little parliamentary time. They involve about 1 million students who are in receipt of some form of statutory Government support, and—by implication, given that we are considering qualifying incomes—their parents or dependants, so there is considerable interest in getting the matter right. To be a little more churlish than I was a moment ago, I point out that the Government's priorities may be revealed by the fact that, although we have previously debated the arrangements for loan recovery from students, it is only as a result of our motion that the substantive student support regulations are now being debated. It is for Committee members and history to decide whether that is a sign of the Government's priorities, although we should bear in mind that they have abolished maintenance awards in most cases.<br><br>
A cursory perusal of this hugely complex document raises some concerns. Officials have thoughtfully arranged for amendments to it to be printed in bold. It is possible, with a wet towel and a following wind, to work out more or less what is going on. I hasten to add, in an attempt to be fair and balanced, that not everything is negative, although none of its provisions trips off the tongue.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary will know that I held his job at one stage. Student loan regulations, or student grant regulations as they were then known, were hugely complex and the prerogative only of experts. I am reminded of the Schleswig-Holstein question, which was understood by perhaps only three people at any one time—but perhaps the hon. Gentleman does not need to be reminded of that.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary has to read but a page or two of the regulations to appreciate how complex they are. That is instanced by the amending regulations, SI 1120, which mention the "disabled person's tax credit" and state that in the definition of "high cost country", for
<br><blockquote><p>the words "countries of the former Soviet Union" substitute the words "the Commonwealth of Independent States".</p></blockquote>
Political circumstances may change again next year, at which point we shall need another set of amending regulations to amend these amending regulations. I make a prediction—I suspect that it is a dead certainty—that we shall need a fresh lot of amending regulations next year, when we may have to have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0045">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
another debate. The Under-Secretary shrugs his shoulders. In view of the structure of the regulations, it is hard to avoid having to amend them continually.<br><br>
One problem—as a Conservative Member, perhaps I should not complain about this—stems from the fact that the original legislation is the Education Act 1962. Even those Committee members who are not paying much attention will recognise that that was enacted 38 years ago. If they did a bit of elementary deduction, they might work out that I was an undergraduate at the time. I shall share with Committee members a resentment that I have nurtured since then—I used to be in receipt of a state scholarship. That was received by public payment, which meant that I had to receipt it with the imposition of a tuppenny stamp before paying it into a bank. After 1962—my second year of full-time undergraduate study—a good many students received a mandatory award from their local education authority by cheque, which had already been pre-paid. Those who had state scholarships were disbenefited to the tune of 2d per term—less than one new penny.<br><br>
It may be instructive to Committee members to learn how venerable I am, how venerable the regulations were and how deep my resentment was. This venerable old concept—I put this point in all seriousness to the Under-Secretary, who may want to respond to it—like a ship, has been gathering barnacles, as anomalies or hard cases are found over the years and, every so often, Ministers come along and knock a few off. However, others are inevitably collected en route and the delivery and clarity of the regulations become more difficult with the passage of years.<br><br>
I want to put on the record my appreciation of the fact that the Department circulates helpful and clear advice to students who live in the real world and must decide what they will do and what they are entitled to. They are unlikely, unless they are gluttons for punishment, to read the regulations. The fact remains that they are of considerable complexity.<br><br>
My first substantive point is to ask the Under-Secretary, bearing in mind the initiatives being taken in the Treasury on tax law simplification, to appoint a group of experts to consider whether the provisions can be made more straightforward. There may be ways of expressing matters differently and more flexibly without permanent amendment. Mortgage interest relief had to be dealt with specifically and a decision had to be taken. The Under-Secretary originally made the wrong decision but has now changed that, which we welcome. However, a simpler formulation might have been to map MIRAS on to other tax reliefs against income tax. I mention that only in passing, but the Under-Secretary should try to clarify the matter for the public weal.<br><br>
My second point concerns the overall economic effect of the regulations. I am sure that the Under-Secretary has a speech prepared to explain what they do and it may be easier to listen to his speech than to read the regulations. One important matter is the provision of loans for part-time courses, which we welcome. Many other points add up to the package
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
and it would be helpful if the Under-Secretary would explain the overall effect. We know that MIRAS was to be disqualified a year early and that is now being changed, but will the Under-Secretary state the overall cost to the Department of the change from the 1999 regulations and the 2000 regulations, whether it is material and what effect it will have?<br><br>
The third issue, which occupies the majority of students, is that, whatever the details of the regulations, we cannot overlook their overall impact. We must take account of the radical changes that the Government have introduced in the substance of the student support package in 1998, which will become reality for almost all students from the next academic year. Students have had their maintenance grants withdrawn and must now rely on loans. When tuition fees must be paid, they may be rebated according to income and there is an element of income contingency in the loans and the repayments, as we discussed earlier.<br><br>
The Government have tried to explain the details, not always plausibly, to the House, but it would be helpful if the Under-Secretary would refer to the wider issues that concern students. Will he tell us what is happening—whether as a result of these changes or otherwise—to student numbers and to applications to universities, especially when seen alongside the numbers of places being provided in higher education? I am worried that, even if the numbers are stable and not expanding, the fact that additional places are being created means that the utilisation of capacity is being reduced.<br><br>
I would also like the Under-Secretary to comment on mature students. They appear to have been a major concern—to which he responded under some pressure earlier this year by introducing a student support package—especially in relation to bursaries. I would like him also to say something about the balance to be struck in dividing those bursaries between bursaries to specific students and access funds. What guidance is being given through the funding council to individual institutions in administering the access funds and the additional money? Has he established the criteria on which that should work, and will he assure the Committee that it will be absolutely fairly apportioned between different classes of students, having regard to their needs? We do not want a further set of anomalies to be created because some institutions are able to fund some classes of students more generously than other institutions can.<br><br>
Will the Under-Secretary also comment on the overall economic situation of students? I am sure that he visits higher education institutions from time to time, as do I and other members of the Committee. I say advisedly, rather than with a deep political intent, that I have heard stories of student hardship over the years, to which I accorded more or less plausibility, but I hope always a degree of sympathy, when I had responsibility for these matters. Those voices are now more organised, more intense and more plausible than I have ever heard them before. That is in relation not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0046">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
only to the total amount on which a student has to live, but to the underlying background to a student's studies.<br><br>
It is all very well for a student to work for two or three hours in the union bar to pick up a little supplementary income to help his or her studies along, or to pay for a holiday, but I hear stories of students who are, in effect, working full-time alongside what is meant to be a full-time academic course. It is difficult to do that. It is difficult, for example, to go to meet one's tutor if one is supposed to be serving in a supermarket at the time. That is not the intention of the student support package that we have established over the years.<br><br>
These are difficult questions. Students' incomes and needs vary hugely. They have to operate within a package that cannot necessarily respond sensitively or precisely to the needs of the individual. The word on the street is that there is great concern about student hardship. The last thing that the Under-Secretary or I want is a further increase in the drop-out numbers, which are tending to edge upwards. That shows the pressure that students face. We do not want that to get out of hand, but there is real concern that it might.<br><br>
When we look at this document of great complexity, and some comparatively minor amendments and adjustments this year, we are reminded of the old saying that we are rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic. They may look tidier for a while, and they may even be in a more logical order, but the danger is that the ship is holed and sinking. The pattern of expansion of student participation and of university numbers over the years—with which we have grown up and which all hon. Members would feel is positive—may be coming to an end and beginning to run the risk of falling backwards, disappointing both the rhetoric of Ministers and the aspirations of future generations of students.</span></p>
<p>4.50 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Allan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris), who is, appropriately enough, on an Education Committee visit, and asked me to speak in his place. He, too, has done some work on the MIRAS issue, which the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) mentioned. The hon. Member for Daventry has spent time tabling parliamentary questions that were helpful to us as another Opposition party considering the regulations. I give full credit to him and to the Under-Secretary for having responded to those anxieties. We, too, did not want any parents to be disadvantaged as a result of the abolition of MIRAS, and we welcome the Under-Secretary's apparent change of heart on the matter. We hope that he will be able to confirm that our fears about any possible disadvantage to parents of current students will not be realised as a result of the amendment.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
I have several points to make about the regulations, including a few points of welcome. We welcome the support for part-time students in part VIII, for which we have long campaigned. Part-time students are an important and, indeed, growing component in the higher education system as increasingly more students cannot afford the cost of leaving work entirely in order to study but want to participate in lifelong learning and therefore take a part-time option, which enables them to study and, perhaps, engage in other activities during that period of study. That part of the regulations is welcome, and we shall continue to press for the support of part-time students to be extended further.<br><br>
We also welcome the amendment in paragraph 3(a) of schedule 1 in respect of those who have been given indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom and have been in this country since before July 1993. People who arrive in the UK and are given permanent status can make an enormous contribution to this country, but they are obviously helped if they have access to appropriate education and support to enable them to take part in education. Such people often require further assistance by definition of their having translocated from another country to the UK, and the fact that the schedule has been amended to allow them access to education is a welcome development.<br><br>
We have a couple of notes of anxiety. Part III relates to grants for fees. The Under-Secretary will be aware of our stated position on tuition fees, which I shall not debate today. Grants for fees are currently subject to a fixed limit of £1,050, reflecting the Government's stated position on fees. We have asked and will continue to ask whether the Government intend to move from that position. Part III provides for differential fees to be paid for particular institutions, such as the university of Buckingham. We are worried that future regulations might be introduced that list a range of different institutions, all of which charge different fees. In considering regulations that govern that, it is appropriate to highlight the anxiety that the Government are due to shift their policy on differential fees and allow different institutions to charge different fees. The fixed £1,050 maximum may, therefore, be replaced in future years. It is not in these regulations, but if the Government were to make such a shift, it would be reflected in future years.<br><br>
Our final anxiety relates to grants for disabled students' living costs, which are covered in part IV. Although we recognise that the Government are making significant grants available, disabled students at universities have expressed anxiety that difficulties relate not merely to the grant for people to support such students. Institutional difficulties are often involved, too, especially for students with mobility problems, which are not currently being tackled universally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been generous to me on a narrow point and has made some thoroughly constructive points in expressing anxieties. On disability issues, for which I also have some responsibility, does he agree that the perspective will change radically and that the Government will need to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0047">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
respond with other promised legislation on disability in education and through implementation of the European convention on human rights? Such matters are likely to make it important that disabled students are treated on the basis of equality and medical assess.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly correct. That point has been reinforced by the Government's stated intention to bring some of those disability discrimination provisions into education at school level, which had previously been left out. We strongly welcome that move, but if they are brought into higher education we shall be seeking grants to support students. I do not mean only helper-type and equipment-type grants, but some students will properly be taking issue with institutions at which access is difficult. More regulations may have to be made to support students so that they can resolve such difficulties. They will have a stronger case for insisting on equality of access facilities that they properly deserve, rather than finding that blocks are put in their way—often not because of the institution's ill will, but because of administrative difficulties that could be overcome with the right support for disabled students. Although I disagree with the fundamental policy governing student support, the regulations will be an improvement on what we would have had. They will provide a measure of support for students over the coming year.</span></p>
<p>4.56 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Malcolm Wicks)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We should not be tempted into a general debate about student or university funding, although inevitably the hon. Members for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) referred to that. All of us find regulations complex. I recall them being so under the previous Government. We do all that we can to simplify them, but we are dealing with a range of detailed matters that make a direct impact on the lives of students and families in areas such as disregards. Regulations will never be the easiest of reads, but we shall consider whether they can be simplified in future. I understand the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Daventry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wicks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is early in my response to do so, but I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for displaying his characteristic courtesy in giving way. My point was entirely genuine and, having heard the hon. Gentleman's welcome assurance about it, I can say only that it would be helpful to bring in an outside person who is used to drafting to see whether it is possible to obtain different perspectives on how the provisions could be made more simple. I am not asking for a blueprint for a regulations rewrite project this evening, but such an exercise would be worth while.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wicks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall consider whether outside helpful would be useful, but I must say that we all write properly at the Department for Education and Employment.<br><br>
Last year, we implemented a major change in how support is delivered and introduced new legislation that governed all aspects of student support and new arrangements for its administration. Those new arrangements are now established and working well. Although some Opposition Members were worried about the ambitious task that we had set ourselves, the implementation of the new student support arrangements last year has been an overall success. The majority of students who applied on time and provided the necessary information received their cheques on time. A fast-track process ensured that late applicants also had access to support at the start of term.<br><br>
Nevertheless, we rightly keep the details of our arrangements under review and make changes when we consider that they are necessary. As a matter of routine, we make new regulations each year to reflect policy changes and introduce uprated levels of support. That is the purpose of the regulations that we have been debating this afternoon. The Education (Student Support) Regulations 2000 will govern student support in the 2000–01 academic year. The Education (Student Support) (Amendment) Regulations 2000 make technical changes in respect of the 1999–2000 academic year. Both sets of regulations were laid before Parliament on 19 April. For the most part, they carry forward the arrangements that are currently in place, but there are some new features to which I draw the Committee's attention. Our aim is to widen access to higher education. The regulations include measures to achieve that.<br><br>
In January, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced a financial support package for mature students in higher education. Such students often have a larger financial commitment because of child care and other needs, and because of pre-existing commitments. The regulations include two important measures from that package. First, we have introduced a school meals grant for students with children aged three to 16 who are wholly dependent on them. Students who received dependence grants for their children will also be eligible for school meal grants of £245 for each primary school child, and £265 for each secondary school child. That removes the anomaly whereby a lone parent who had been on income support and eligible for free school meals for her children would, because of the student finance package, not be eligible for that social security benefit, and would not therefore receive free school meals for her children. We listened to lone and other parents about that, and designed the measure accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection to what the Under-Secretary is suggesting in principle. Would he tell the Committee, as I have been trying to do some quick mental arithmetic, the basis on which the figures that he quoted were arrived at? At first sight, the provision seems ample for almost all circumstances for which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0048">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
meals are charged by local education authorities. Was the figure calculated by using a highest common factor of cost, a mean figure or another basis?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wicks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, we tried to meet the need, and the differential between primary and secondary reflects the calculations. Perhaps I could write to the hon. Member for Daventry with detailed data, or, given the subject matter, discuss it over lunch—school lunch.<br><br>
Secondly, we have eased substantially the income assessment for mature students, as they often have financial commitments that younger students do not. Many mature students will now be able to have £7,500 of their income disregarded without losing entitlement to student support. That figure has been increased from £820, so it should make a considerable difference. It will be a welcome improvement for many mature students.<br><br>
The numbers of part-time students continue to grow. That is partly because of the buoyant economy—people choose to be part of the labour market while improving their qualifications—and partly because mature students often find that part-time study is the best route to gaining higher education qualifications, as it fits their career and family life more effectively. Part-time courses are an important tool in terms of widening participation and access to higher education. It is high time, therefore, that part-time students should have better support. The regulations introduce new loans of £500 for part-time students on low incomes and extend disabled students allowances to disabled students on part-time courses for the first time.<br><br>
People who take up part-time courses will inevitably incur costs—not just tuition fees but costs of travel, books, equipment, and, sometimes, child care. Those costs can often seem insurmountable to people on low incomes who are considering taking up higher education or struggling to stay in it. Universities have been provided with funds to waive tuition fees for students on low incomes and those who become unemployed during the course. Those new loans of £500 a year will help to meet many of the costs associated with taking higher education courses. Students will repay the loans, on the same generous terms as full-time students, when they complete the course.<br><br>
Students with disabilities have been of great concern to the Department. Such students often find it difficult to commit to the requirements of full-time courses. Until now, however, they have lacked the financial support to take up part-time courses. We have extended in the regulations allowances for disabled students on part-time courses. Part-time students will now be able to apply for grants of up to £7,879 for each academic year of a course to help to cover the costs of a non-medical personal helper or carer. They may also apply for grants of up to £4,155 for expenditure on major items of specialist equipment that they may need to take the course, grants to cover the additional cost of travel and a general grant of up to £1,039 for each academic year of the course.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
Disability lobbies have campaigned to extend those grants to part-time students and welcome the change. In addition, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced last month that allowances of up to £5,000 will be provided to disabled postgraduate students from 2000–01, and we shall introduce regulations in due course to implement the new measure.<br><br>
There has been interest and concern about the removal of the disregard for mortgage interest payments that attract tax relief. That removal follows the Government's wider decision to abolish tax relief on mortgage interest from April 2000. As the hon. Member for Daventry knows, the process of moving away from mortgage tax relief was started by the previous Government. It makes no sense to retain a disregard for a tax allowance that has been withdrawn when that disregard was of benefit only to parents who had already benefited from tax relief. Parents who do not own their homes did not benefit from the disregard and will not miss it now that it has gone. However, we do not wish to impose a greater burden on parents of students who began their courses before 2000–01. It is only reasonable that, when students have started a course, the rules governing their support should remain broadly the same. As parents of those students will generally be assessed on their income in 1999–2000, we have taken steps to ensure that the disregard continues to apply this year. I hope that that is an example of how we have listened to legitimate concerns and acted wisely. We have laid amending regulations this week to ensure that parents of existing students are not affected by removal of the disregard.<br><br>
With the abolition of tax relief for mortgage interest payments this year, the disregard will end naturally for all parents next year when their income and expenditure in 2000–01 is assessed. However, we have already announced that we plan to increase the parental contribution threshold to £20,000 from £17,805 in 2001–02, which will benefit all parents and not just those with mortgages.<br><br>
I shall deal briefly with the point about the life assurance disregard. That gave a limited group of parents with life assurance policies that were taken out before 1984 a double benefit with tax relief on payments and a disregard for income when determining their contribution to their children's support. It is not comparable to the MIRAS disregard and it affects far fewer parents, translating into an average increase in parental contributions of between £10 and £15. Life assurance policies are a matter for parents, unlike pensions, which are properly allowed for, and we do not believe that a compromise comparable to that for mortgage interest is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Under-Secretary could assist the Committee by telling us more about that change?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wicks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot do so now, but I shall write to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
Most of the remaining changes in the 2000 regulations and all the amendments to the 1999 regulations have been made to clarify our intentions or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0049">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
to improve the regulations technically. They help to meet our commitment to improve access to higher education. Together with the range of other initiatives that we are introducing, we believe that we have a sound strategy in place to make meaningful our commitments to higher education available to all.<br><br>
I thank the hon. Member for Hallam for his support for those people who have been granted leave to remain under law and for the regulations which help those students have access to higher education. It is right and proper that we are changing the law in this way. I shall repeat the points that we have made constantly. The Government do not believe in top-up fees. This morning, during Education and Employment questions, I repeated the pledge made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. The hon. Gentleman's concerns do not arise. We want access to universities, even our best ones, open to all students. We do not believe that top-up fees are the route to follow.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked about the cost of these measures. It would be useful to write to him to give him the appropriate detail. I shall give him a brief idea: we estimate that part-time loans will cost about £50 million and that part-time disability allowances will cost some £8.5 million. The school meal grants and the higher threshold for mature students are part of the £68 million package which we announced in January. If I can give greater help to the hon. Gentleman, I shall do so in correspondence.<br><br>
Access funds are not covered in the regulations. With all due respect to the hon. Member for Daventry, I do not think that we should consider those. Because I am anxious to help, I shall write to him on those points.<br><br>
We all understand that some regulations are complex, but it is appropriate that they are scrutinised where demand arises. I am pleased that the hon. Member for Daventry wanted us to scrutinise the regulations in Committee, because that has allowed me to set out the fair-minded and decent Government policies that will enable more of our young people, whatever their circumstances, to get access to universities. I know that the hon. Member for Daventry is concerned about the complexity of the regulations. He cited the changes affecting the USSR and the need for changes to regulations there. I am afraid that, in my lowly office as junior Education Minister, I was not able to influence events there so that he would not have to be troubled by changing the regulations, much to his no doubt innocent irritation.</span></p>
<p>5.13 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary was his characteristic conciliatory self. There was a whiff of complacency in his remarks. Given that he has genuinely sought to assist the Committee, and more particularly students, by introducing concessions and one or two welcome improvements, it would be churlish not to acknowledge that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
I was a little more concerned at the way in which the Under-Secretary gently passed over a couple of matters of substance. One was in relation to the interaction with the overall student support package. He was reluctant to be drawn on access funds. He was absolutely right: they do not appear in the regulations. However, they are important to those students where the shoe pinches. The hon. Gentleman was perhaps even more scrupulous that you might require him to be, Sir David, in not discussing the overall economic position of students. If he does not want to say anything about that today, students will have to form their own conclusions.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary was a little revealing on the subject of top-up fees, and I feel that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan)—perhaps for this purpose I can call him my hon. Friend—will return to that point. The Under-Secretary said, as he said clearly at Education and Employment questions this morning, there would be no top-up fees—there would be no differentiated structure to which the student support package would have to respond. I suspect, although I might be wrong, that in law that might result in hybridity or something ghastly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has raised the point again, it is important that I make it clear that I was referring to differential fees, not to top-up fees. Under regulation 11, one fee level is set for publicly funded institutions, yet further on the regulation provides for private institutions to receive differential fees. Differential fees are quite distinct from top-up fees. Institutions will charge students top-up fees directly, whereas differential fees will be charged to the state and might in future be grant-funded under the regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, who is my hon. Friend for this purpose, makes a fair distinction, but the plain fact is that, if institutions set different fee levels and students receive a monolithic package that takes no account of that, students will be less inclined to go to institutions, whether they are described as elitist or otherwise, that charge higher fees. We should not accept the Under-Secretary's assurance at face value, although of course I accept his bona fides. The Secretary of State's formulation was a little different. He said in a speech at, I recall, Greenwich that he would oppose top-up fees during his time as Secretary of State, but added that he would not be Secretary of State for ever. I understand those assertions, but a subsequent Secretary of State—perhaps from the same party if it lasts that long—might decide that top-up fees are appropriate. I mention that as a marker.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary has, in micro, been helpful and some changes proposed in the regulations are helpful. We welcome his willingness to have a dialogue and to explain the regulations to us. In macro, however, substantial problems remain and decisions will have to be taken. He has not dealt with them very effectively today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wicks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not done so because that is not the purpose of this scrutiny Committee. I shall debate these matters any place, any time with the hon.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
Gentleman; I should love to have the opportunity to tell him that a record amount is going into access funds—a far more generous amount than under the previous Administration. The purpose of this Committee is to scrutinise regulations; we shall debate the wider issues at the appropriate time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to rise to the challenge that the Under-Secretary has set me. We will have to discuss these issues in future—perhaps quite soon. I withdraw any imputation that he was reluctant to say anything about his policies and I shall leave him and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
the Committee with the thought that whatever we have discussed this afternoon, which has been useful, other, wider discussions will have to be heldsoon.</span></p>
