	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Browning 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tiverton and Honiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999, No 3323).</p></blockquote>
The debate is indicative of new Labour—it is unnecessary and old-fashioned, and it shows no working knowledge of the way in which businesses have progressed since the 1970s. The measure has its genesis in the social chapter, from which the Conservative party negotiated an opt-out in the interest of all British businesses. That occurred when my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) negotiated and signed the Maastricht treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Conservatives' stewardship in the previous Parliament, businesses were protected from outmoded, socialist and very European measures, and from Governments who think that they know better than businesses what should happen in a business. I worked for a British manufacturer in the 1970s. I ran my own business for 10 years during the 1980s and spent time with thousands of companies in this country and elsewhere, especially with manufacturers, which had traditionally often had a unionised work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will recall the culture in British manufacturers and in other companies during the 1970s. Our record included one of the highest rates of industrial strife measured in days lost. That was because of the way in which the unions and management failed to work together in the workplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the 1970s. The measure is old-fashioned because things have moved on for many reasons. In the 1980s, the Conservative party's Acts of Parliament reformed trade unions and gave control of them to the membership by taking it away from those who ran them and held power in them. Communication in the workplace between the management and the work force changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Companies are in a new millennium. There is a unionised work force in my constituency. When I go as a Member of Parliament to talk to a company, I expect the shop stewards to be sitting at the table with management. They have not needed an Act of Parliament or an interfering, busybody Government to tell them that that is the way to run their company. The approach has changed over the past 20 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
We have not seen such an environment in all European countries. We recognise that France, for example, has been slow to put in place such trade union reforms as those from which we have benefited for 15 years. We still see there the power of the trade unions and the way in which strike action is still often a primary measure rather than a last resort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That culture does not apply here, but the Government have decided not to build on what has been a sea change, not only in workplace trade union relations but, I hope, in the management of British businesses since the early 1980s. The combination of those and other factors has meant that there is a difference in the way in which work force and management communicate and combine when there is union recognition in a workplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members commonly throw across the Chamber the accusation that Conservative Members are anti-union. I shall put my credentials clearly on the table. I am not anti-union; I am "anti" the implication that provisions should be mandatory in the workplace. Union recognition should be voluntary. As a Member of Parliament, I frequently suggest that constituents with a difficult dispute in the workplace take advice from their union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the difference. We have moved on, not because of Labour Members, who would still have us in the 1970s taking confrontational stances when issues are to be discussed, but because of the Conservative party, which liberated paid-up trade union members. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Labour Members may laugh, but they know that that is true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider some of the other factors that have made a difference to the way in which management and unions communicate in the workplace. There are two matters to consider regarding the works councils. The first is recognition in the workplace, and the way in which the measure introduces the role of the unions. The second is that commonsense businesses and managers would do, are doing and have done for many years such things for themselves. That is why the measure is so old-fashioned and so 1970s. I am surprised that Government Members—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lindsay Hoyle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chorley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of us do not remember the 1970s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that younger hon. Members will wish to learn from us older MPs who have years of experience of working in British businesses such as manufacturers. I am happy to share my experiences with the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle); I hope that he will sit up and pay proper attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to give an example. In the 1980s, I fought the seat held by the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody), for whom I have great respect. There were then two main employers in Crewe—Rolls-Royce plc's motor car division, which was doing well, and British Rail Engineering Ltd, which was publicly owned. I used to go around canvassing. I am interested in what people do at work, and so would ask on the doorstep how people were getting on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
At Rolls-Royce, even trainees would say, for instance, that there had been an order from the United States during the previous week. No matter what job a member of the big work force did, they would know such things. They worked for a company with such a line of communication. Management believed it essential that news was communicated, that people were motivated by it, that people understood the purpose of their job in the plant and that they contributed to the overall success of the company. When people from BREL were asked, they would shrug their shoulders and say that they did not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contrast between the approaches of two different companies in the same town was stark. The difference was not only to do with unions and the work force, but to do with management styles. The contrast was between a privately owned company and one still in the public sector. The privatisation of so many big companies in the 1970s and 1980s by the Conservative party changed their workplace culture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many other factors were introduced. When I used to be in business on my own, back in the real world, I would talk to American or Japanese businesses. Both would claim credit for introducing just-in-time systems into the workplace. But in the early 1980s, just-in-time systems represented a change in culture for purchasers and suppliers. The very nature of the changes, especially in the manufacturing sector, meant that management had to communicate more with their work force. Quality-related issues became important. There were one or two unsuccessful experiments, but the general principles of improving quality and performance related to the output of goods and involved every person at every level in the workplace, both on the shop floor and in management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
***The Government want to impose works councils on a work force simply because they exist in a company's European operation That reflects the European Union's employment policies, under the aegis of the social chapter. The Government think that works councils are right for the United Kingdom, but they are not. Their attitude displays a lack of understanding of the way in which British companies have developed. The Government have not acknowledged how management and work forces work together. They do communicate. Representations are officially placed on the table when there is a matter for negotiation or discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the Government's first acts was to sign up to the social chapter as part of the Amsterdam treaty. We are not discussing a new measure. It has already been imposed by Europe. The Government signed up not just for legislation that is yet to come—I am sure that there are more horrors in store—but for retrospective legislation. The size of the fines is outrageous. The Central Arbitration Committee can set up employment appeals and civil fines of up to £75,000 can be imposed. Since the Government came to power, we have known that although they talk the language of business, they do not understand how to run one. I hope that for once the Minister will give an accurate figure of the on-costs to business of imposing the regulations on their affairs. Up to now, British businesses with overseas interests have not needed
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Ministers to tell them how to communicate. Will there be a mini-Alastair Campbell session for businesses so that the Government can teach them how to communicate better?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the Department of Trade and Industry, the recurring cost to business will be £14.5 million. If the Government were consultants setting up a system in a business, they would jolly well have to justify the benefits to charge a fee like that. I would have been glad to receive that fee to encourage businesses to improve their communications—an area in which I specialised. I was never underemployed and was reasonably well remunerated. But the Government are imposing more costs. They have created another regulation task force in the Cabinet Office to remove the very regulations that they are imposing day after day, and which add to overall business costs. That money has to come off the bottom line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More importantly, the Government have the arrogance to tell business that when it comes to communication, they know best. They think that they know how to create the structures in a workplace that allow management and work force to work together for mutual benefit. But that is another sop to keep their European partners happy. The Government owe them a few favours because they are dragging their feet on joining the euro and abandoning the pound. Somewhere along the line, they have to throw them the odd titbit to show that they are good Europeans and that they are on board. I understand the motivation, but the regulations are bad for British business and old-fashioned; they have a place in the 1970s, but not in the new millennium. When I speak to representatives of businesses—this applies more to big businesses than to small businesses—I get one message, which is that they want the Government off their backs. This measure does nothing to encourage businesses to believe that the Government are serious about business and understand it or, for that matter, that they should be taken seriously when they talk about lifting burdens, deregulation and the rest. It is all a load of tosh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.10 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Competitiveness (Mr. Alan Johnson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much as I would love to join in a philosophical debate about the change in employment relations since the 1970s, the changes in the trade union movement and changes in the whole gamut of the workplace, I would much rather discuss the European works council directive, which is completely different. I understand that I will have another chance to respond to some of the points that have been made, but I think that it is obligatory for me to place on the record something about what we have been debating this morning. It is not the end of civilisation as we know it. In fact the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton and the rest of the Conservative party are alone of all the centre right mainstream political parties in Europe because no politician from any sister party would have made such a speech. It would be absolutely incomprehensible to them, as it is to the Confederation of British Industry, the Engineering Employers Federation and the European

study group, which consists of 50 employers' representatives who worked closely with us on the regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a letter from the European study group, dated December 1999, which says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"These regulations are expected to propose the introduction of automatic legally binding collective agreement. This concept was abandoned when tried in the 1970s and is not welcomed by employers."</p></blockquote>
Surely the hon. Gentleman does not support that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I did not catch the name of the organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The European study group. I think that was the name of the organisation that the Minister just mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The European study group has worked closely with us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Improving information and consultation is a primary objective of collective arrangements and is especially important in large multinational organisations where management decisions may be taken far away from the employees affected. That is why the Government welcome the extension to the United Kingdom of the European works council directive, which lays down sensible minimum standards for informing and consulting employees at European level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations that we are discussing today fulfil not only a manifesto commitment—I remind the Opposition that we actually fought the previous election on the basis that we would sign the social chapter, which is probably one of the reasons for our overwhelming victory, but the Government are also implementing directive 97/74, which extends the European works council directive to the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European works council directive sets out requirements for informing and consulting employees at the European level in undertakings, which may include partnerships or other forms of organisation, as well as companies or groups with at least 1,000 employees throughout the member states and at least 150 employees in each of two or more of those member states. It therefore applies only to large multinational undertakings and organisations such as Glaxo Wellcome, British Telecom, Unilever and NatWest, which have already reached agreements voluntarily with no problems whatsoever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Voluntarily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I shall come to that. We are discussing voluntary arrangements. The regulations set out procedures for negotiating a European works council directive between management and employees. This process is not imposed on anyone; it is triggered either as a result of a management initiative or after a written request from at least 100 employees or their representatives in two or more member states. There is no obligation to negotiate if no request is received. It is mainly for the parties concerned to decide what details are contained in the European works council agreements.
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Negotiations occur between management and employees, with the latter represented by a special negotiating body consisting of representatives of employees from all the European Economic Area member states. The area in which the undertakings operate goes wider than the European Union and includes Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, which voluntarily entered into the measures. In general, a ballot of the entire UK work force will select the United Kingdom's members of a special negotiating body, unless a consultative committee exists. A consultative committee whose members were elected by a ballot of all UK employees and which performs an information and consultation function on their behalf may appoint from its number the UK representatives on the special negotiating body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Special provisions apply if management refuse to negotiate within six months of receiving a request for a European works council or if the parties fail to conclude a negotiated agreement within three years. In such cases, a European works council must be set up in accordance with the statutory model set out in the schedule to the regulations. The fallback position therefore applies only if a company and work force cannot voluntarily agree their own arrangements. The schedule sets out requirements concerning the size and establishment of a European works council and lists topics on which it has the right to be informed and consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations apply on a UK wide and will be enforced through the central arbitration committee and the employment appeals tribunal in Great Britain and the industrial court in Northern Ireland. The central arbitration committee and the employment appeals tribunal may refer a case to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service if conciliation is considered possible. The employment appeals tribunal may impose a financial penalty if management is found to have acted in breach of the regulations without reasonable excuse. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton quoted a figure of £75,000, but I doubt whether that would mean much to Glaxo Wellcome, British Telecom or Unilever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To whom does the hon. Gentleman think that corporate fines are passed on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I had been speaking about a fine of £750,000, the hon. Lady might have had a point, but I was speaking about one of £75,000. The fine is meant to be an impediment to organisations that refuse to comply with proper practice, having received a petition from their employees to set up a European works council. It should also be an impediment to companies whose employees are not receiving information and are not being consulted on issues that affect their working lives. The measure is very reasonable in such circumstances. Some Labour Members think that they do not go far enough—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
The regulations address the issue of confidentiality and provide that management may withhold information or require a European works council to hold it in confidence where,
	<br><blockquote><p>"according to objective criteria, the disclosure of the information or document would seriously harm the functioning of, or would be prejudicial to, the undertaking".</p></blockquote>
The regulations contain specific measures to ensure that the information offered by an employer, which will sometimes be sensitive, is kept confidential. If employees believe that management are withholding information or imposing confidentiality beyond what is permitted by the regulations, the special negotiating body or European works council members can appeal to the central arbitration committee, which would rule case by case. The employees and members of a special negotiating body and the European works council are given protections when asserting their rights or performing duties under the regulations. Employment tribunals and industrial tribunals in Northern Ireland will hear claims that relate to victimisation or unfair dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important feature of the regulations is that they do not apply to undertakings that have concluded voluntary agreements where these provide for transnational information and consultation of the employees, and cover the entire work force in the European Economic Area. Such agreements must have been made by the deadline laid down in the relevant directive. There is no attempt to interfere with voluntary agreements already reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transitional provisions apply to undertakings, here and abroad, that have started negotiations under the law of another member state, before the entry into force of the UK regulations. Where a UK-based undertaking has previously concluded a European works council agreement in another member state, it may be made subject to the UK regulations if both parties consent. Otherwise, it remains under the jurisdiction of the member state under whose legislation it was concluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European works council directive provides a flexible structure under which multinational enterprises can formulate agreements to inform and consult their employees at a European level. In implementing the directive through these regulations, we are conferring on UK employees the same rights to information on their business that their colleagues in other EU states enjoy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By opposing the measure, the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton suggests that only British workers of all the work forces in a multinational company covering the whole of the European Economic Area can be left out of the loop and managers can disregard their interests and fail to inform or to consult them. We are extending the same rights that their colleagues in other EU states have enjoyed for the past three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many UK companies are already covered by the directive as a result of their extensive operations throughout Europe, the vast majority of which already include their UK work force in their arrangements, but until now they have not been obliged to do so.
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Previously, they could exclude what was often their largest single European work force from receiving information that directly affected them. The regulations end that anomaly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are mindful of the voluntary tradition in UK employment relations and the directive acknowledges the benefit of that approach by exempting organisations that already have European-level information and consultation procedures. The original directive allowed companies two years to set up such agreements, and when we signed up to the directive we negotiated a similar two-year period for newly covered companies to establish their own arrangements. Therefore, we announced in 1998 that companies that had voluntary agreements in place by 15 December 1999 would not be covered by the obligations in the regulations. In that way, companies were aware of the opportunity to develop their own arrangements and had time to do so. That is an important provision, and of the vast majority of existing EWC European works council agreements about three-quarters are voluntary agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In developing the regulation, we have listened to both sides of industry. Before implementation, we carried out a full three-month consultation on the detailed policy and regulations. We also held a seminar explaining the consultation proposals and allowing interested parties to provide less formal feedback. As a result of the responses, we made a number of changes before laying the final regulations. The changes have improved the final package, which follows the principle of avoiding unnecessary "goldplating" of the directive and does not disturb the existing arrangements of companies that have EWCs or voluntary agreements. As a result of the thorough consultation that we have undertaken, implementation has not proved to be controversial with either the CBI or TUC or with anyone other than the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton and there has been little comment in the media on the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Department commissioned an independent report into the costs associated with European works councils based on a survey of companies with real life experience of operating agreements. The results of that study were incorporated into the regulatory impact assessment, a draft of which was included in the consultation. While the directive has been fully implemented, the regulatory impact of our policy has been minimised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be clear who is covered by the regulations. They do not affect companies that already have agreements. They do not affect the small local business man running his operation with 60 employees. They do not affect the large-scale enterprise with thousands of employees, if it has no operations in the European Economic Area. The regulations cover only multinationals that have at least 1,000 employees in total and at least 150 employees in each of at least two different EEA countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister confirm just how many companies are affected? As he will know, his Government quoted 110 countries, but that figure has been challenged by many people, not least the law firm

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I saw that article in the 	<i>Financial Times.</i> It is the only article published anywhere and it gave no supporting information. The best analysis is the TUC's analysis of the companies affected, which we have used throughout and which has not been challenged from any quarter. We say that the measure will affect 111 companies in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be emphasised that the regulations are mainly concerned with procedures rather than the content, which is left to the parties. In the first instant the regulations give precedence to voluntary agreements negotiated prior to their introduction. Where a voluntary agreement does not exist the regulations provide for the establishment of negotiating procedures so that management and employees can come to their own agreement. It is only where negotiations fail that the fall-back provisions contained in the schedule will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations will be enforced by the parties themselves, by the CAC or the EAT. The Government judged it unnecessary for an entirely new body to be created to enforce the regulations, so new powers are to be granted to those existing bodies. Both are well acquainted with employment relations matters. The EAT will be able to impose a civil financial penalty of up to £75,000 on an employer where appropriate, but a penal approach is not the aim of the regulations. The emphasis throughout is on negotiation. Both the CAC and the EAT will look first to see if conciliation is possible before hearing a case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want management and employees to come to an agreement that they can both support and abide by. The three years negotiating period is a generous one. There should not be a need for the statutory European works council to be foisted upon any organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where agreements are in place, business is often concerned about confidentiality. There is a balance to be struck. If meaningful consultation is to take place, important and sometimes sensitive details of the companies' plans and financial position may be discussed. It is important therefore that business is reassured that confidential information will be treated properly. The regulations impose a duty on those involved in the consultation process not to disclose any information provided to them by management on a confidential basis. A breach of that duty could lead to a civil action against the person who leaked the information. But at the same time there is an onus on management not to impose confidentiality where it is unnecessary or to withhold information, the release of which would not cause the organisation serious harm or be prejudicial to it. The employee side may appeal to the CAC if they believe that management are in breach of this obligation and the CAC will judge the matter on a case-by-case basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These regulations are an important element in the Government's promotion of partnership and fairness at work alongside competitiveness and adaptability. As far as multinational companies are concerned,
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
decisions taken in one country may affect employees in another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These regulations give UK employees in large multinationals minimum rights to information and consultation at European level that are sensible for them and sensible for business. I therefore ask this Committee to defeat the motion and approve the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cotter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. It aptly describes the Conservative party in its response to this initiative, which I welcome on behalf of the Liberal Democrats. The hon. Lady said that the regulations were unnecessary. Indeed, they will not be necessary if all the companies involved adopt proper procedures. The regulations are especially necessary because, as the Minister said, the companies have a European aspect and many of us, including consumers and workers, are uneasy about the great power of large international conglomerates. The regulations are welcome to ensure that that power can at least be kept track of and that those who work in such companies know exactly what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been waiting for such a measure for some time. Not so many years ago, when I was 18 or thereabouts, I wanted works councils and so on to be adopted in this country. I know from experience that many workplaces have not adopted the proper procedures to consult the work force. What is wrong with consulting the work force?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course there is nothing wrong with consulting the work force. I spent many years of my business life helping management and work forces adopt procedures that enabled them to consult more effectively. We object to the fact that the Government are putting such procedures on a statutory basis and determining business structures. Such decisions are best left to the businesses themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cotter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If works councils and consultation are properly implemented, such measures will not be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had thought that 110 companies were involved and that a further 200 members would be brought within the regulations when they come into effect. Some companies do an extremely good job of consulting their work forces on all issues. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton should consider that we are discussing consultations with employees on investments, substantial changes and other information that those in this country who work in broadly based European companies need to know. It is important that our work forces know what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister confirm whether 200 companies are involved? I thought that 200, not 110, more companies would be brought within the regulations
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
and that 110 companies already had a responsibility to implement them. It is encouraging that, as the Minister said, there will be no unnecessary gold plating, and we shall watch that in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the impact assessment, it is important that the £14 million is related to how many companies will come under the regulations. If that money is spread over many hundreds of companies with more than 1,000 people, it represents a small sum for each business. I welcome the regulations and hope that business practices will be improved and that the work force will feel more involved. If work forces feel more involved, companies operate far better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton rightly reminded us what things were like under the previous Labour Government. I had the experience of being a Member of Parliament under that Government. You would take me to task, Mrs. Roe, if I were to refer to inflation figures of 26 per cent. and all the other problems of unemployment and the winter of discontent, but they were symptomatic of the labour-employer relations that existed at the time.

As Prime Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon carried out an absolutely splendid deal when he obtained opt-outs from the Maastricht treaty. They gave us time to think regarding various aspects of the social chapter. There has been a change in work culture and a move into the real world, where, if one does not produce or sell, one goes nowhere. I say to the serried ranks of Labour Members, whose idea of employment is probably how they intend to spend their parliamentary secretarial allowance, that people who have worked on a production line know that they must produce a certain number of items every day to a certain quality or that product will not go out; I wonder how many of them can say that they have worked on the shop floor and know what it is like.

I have to go back to the days of British Leyland and Red Robbo. That group of companies had more than 30 per cent. of the home market in registrations. Now, even with BMW, it is struggling to make 5 per cent. The reality is that they did not accept the necessary changes. I am just trying to reinforce what my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am having trouble following the hon. Gentleman's argument.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that was being made is that, over many years, there has been a transition in workplace culture, especially—but not exclusively—in manufacturing. Does my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire agree that, as we saw changes, particularly in management styles and initiatives in bringing the work force into many quality-based initiatives, the line of communication that the Government want to put into law evolved because it had to? There were many circumstances in which companies had to accept it or become uncompetitive. Should that be dealt with separately by a top-down Government-imposed structure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an essential point. The Government swept into power, after a marvellous campaign which I can only admire. Indeed, I wish that we had run as efficient and effective a campaign.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Steady on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may say "Steady on". However, we lost. We did not consult focus groups accurately. One focus group said, "We want more money on the national health and education." Another lot said, "You can't put up taxes.". Saying "yes" to both was a winning combination. The fact that neither has happened is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Government inherited a golden legacy of the right economic climate and decreasing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
unemployment. When comparisons are made with Europe, with all its burdens, its employment level makes one think, "Gosh, will all these regulations cost British workers jobs?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the short time in which the Minister has been in post, his brow has become more furrowed and his shoulders have sagged under the pressure—just as mine did when I was in his position. I remember being lambasted by the Labour spokesman, who told me that regulations were a crime and a burden on industry and business. I was told that that would never happen when there was a Labour Government. However, in 1999, a record number of regulations were imposed on British industry by that very Government. When I remember all the things that were said to me, I think, "What hypocrisy."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should I believe the Minister when he tells me that not much is involved, that everything will be under control and voluntary and that we will live happily ever after? I am sure that he is reading accurately from his brief. However, real-world experience does not put me in an overly enthusiastic mood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployment has come down because we had a real campaign which has been continued by the Government. The Invest in Britain Bureau has done a magnificent job. Why have investors come in? I went to Japan, where businesses told me that they come to Britain because we have a flexible work force and low regulations. So Japanese businesses come in and jobs follow. In the car industry, Toyota, Nissan and Honda and industry supply companies have come in because we have low regulations. Everything has been going marvellously. A much higher percentage of such companies has come to Britain than to other European countries: they have come here, not to Germany, France or Italy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cotter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should let the hon. Gentleman know that I have never been to Japan. However, are not Japanese companies doing so well or have done in the past—because they operate through works councils?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Japanese have always had a different approach to employee regulation. In the past, someone employed by a Japanese company had a job for life. The idea of a strike was against every form of culture: it was a form of dishonesty or disloyalty to the family. However, the wind of change has been blowing through Japanese companies. Recent economic problems have brought about a change in some of their approaches. I recommend that the hon. Gentleman visits Japan if he can, because he will find two different worlds: the just-in-time manufacturing world working like mad and, by contrast, the grossly over-provided service side, which has too many people doing very little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employer costs in this country are rising and we have on-costs of about 17 per cent., whereas in Germany they are about 30 per cent. and in France they are more than 40 per cent. Despite all those on-costs and regulations, Germany and France have a serious black economy. I know from having spent some time in France that the pressures of people
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
wanting a black economy and wanting to be paid in cash are extremely high. Indeed, someone who pays the full price for a house is regarded as mad. When I did that, I was asked, "Don't you want to pay some money in cash to avoid paying the French equivalent of VAT?" I replied, "No, I shall pay the full price" and was regarded as being from another planet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton spoke about signing up to the Amsterdam treaty in 1997. Government Members said "Hear, hear" and "Marvellous". However, they do not realise that the pressures of the social chapter are still to fall on British industry and business. The order is only one extra step. My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton quoted the European study group. The Minister claims that everyone is onside. However, the letter that I have before me is not a ringing endorsement and it seems to express considerable doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to argue with the Minister. However, it does not appear that what he quoted in favour is necessarily so. I wonder whether CBI enthusiasm is as great as it was made to appear initially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) made an interesting contribution. However, the Liberals are in favour of everything European—good, bad or indifferent.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cotter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I have to listen to this rubbish, Mrs. Roe? If the hon.

Having picked out that point, I shall not dwell on any others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted and exceedingly grateful that the hon. Gentleman has risen to the bait and provided an opportunity to keep matters rolling along for a few more minutes. I would be only too happy to give way, should he wish to intervene again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be positive for a moment or two. I welcome the Minister's comments on adopting a voluntary approach, rather than imposing measures on us, which will give British industry a better chance to operate them, but having spoken to continental countries with such measures I am somewhat sceptical. They told me about secret board meetings at which decisions are made and from which information cannot be released because people cannot be trusted not to go to a wider audience. Such a breach of confidentiality would impose great expense and costs on the company. There is no way that any form of financial redress can compensate what could be a hugely expensive loss of company profits or assets. As we all know, many of these takeover and amalgamation bids—today Ford is to make an announcement—can be hugely expensive to a company if they are prematurely leaked. I suspect that we have a degree of window dressing here that will have no practical effect in the real world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chorley talked about Rolls-Royce. When things go wrong I never blame the work force. I always blame the management because that is what the management are for and if management are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0115">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
not doing it properly one cannot blame the people. Sometimes the work force needs to be told and needs to be led, but one cannot blame the work force because the management have failed to do their job. These regulations can be carried by the larger companies, purely and simply because they have the resources to do it. But I just see it as an extra burden. As sure as night follows day, under this Government's enthusiasm to sign up for everything in the social chapter the burdens on business will grow and grow and the percentage that have to pay of the various on-costs of salary will rise and rise. Unemployment will go up, a black economy will be in operation and it will not be good for Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.51 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee too long as we have had quite a run around this course. The Opposition have made our views pretty well known. We disagree strongly in principle with unnecessary Government interference in the internal running of businesses, and that is what this is all about. It is outdated and outmoded. However, perhaps we have had our own works council in microcosm in Committee today. It has been good humoured, robust and straight talking and it has done all the things that we would have expected—so much so that I almost detected in the Minister's opening remarks that he was so enamoured by the force of my argument that he was encouraging his hon. Friends to vote against the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to be conciliatory about this. If the Minister can assure me that he and his hon. Friends will vote with us, I will be willing to co-operate in a mini works council on any issue that he wishes to name. I want to be helpful. I see this as a voluntary way forward when, in a debate in this Room, points can be listened to and taken on board and a Government can actually change their mind as a result of the strength of the argument that is put before them. This is democracy at work. I knew that we could expect no less of this Minister, and I welcome it. One of the tasks that I am charged with in opposition as shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is to see what I can roll back when the Conservatives come to office. Today's debate shows me just the sort of thing that I shall roll back—and pretty quickly, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think 	<i>Hansard</i> will record that I urged my hon. Friends to oppose the motion. In view of my terrible inexperience as a Minister, I had a chat with the Whip. I am sorry for any confusion that may have been caused. It would have been helpful if we had been in a genuine debating spirit. It has been a good-natured debate. It would have been useful to have heard some arguments from the Opposition about why we should not approve the directive. We did not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a time earlier in the debate when I thought that I should put on my flares and tank top and go back to the 1970s; but the rewriting of history was inaccurate. Leaving that to one side, the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton should be able to support the regulations; she said that there is nothing wrong with consulting the work force. We are talking about the much more difficult matter of multinational companies taking decisions that affect the work force.
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
A negotiating forum is not proposed; trade unions do not even have the right of ascendancy to fill seats on the works councils. A genuine ballot of the whole work force, whether or not unionised, will take place. Trade unions will be part of the bodies if they have been properly elected. The problem is that two phrases bring the Conservatives out in a rash: "European" and "work councils".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind Conservative Members that the directive states that work forces will receive information on the economic and financial situation, likely developments in the company, probable employment trends, the introduction of new working methods—which is perhaps of some concern to them—substantial organisational changes, mergers, cuts, closures and collective redundancies. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton, for whom I have a great deal of time, says, and she believes it, that there is nothing wrong with consulting the work force, so she should support the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
European works councils exist to ensure that discussions take place under a voluntary arrangement in which the work force has to ask the employer for information and consultation. I am pleased that the majority of employers already take part in such arrangements voluntarily. We want to ensure that British workers are informed and consulted in the minority of companies that do not believe in consulting the work force—a very British aspect of industrial relations. It is a peculiarly British notion that people move from a democracy to an oligarchy when they go to work. Many people in the Conservative party have encouraged that notion over the years. The regulations represent a small and modest step along a civilised route.

I am fascinated by the discussion about what happened in the 1970s and 1980s because it was so inaccurate. The hon. Members for Tiverton and Honiton and for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr Page) said that they do not believe in placing burdens on business, but what the Conservative party did in government was absolutely extraordinary. I am not talking only about the changes introduced by Jim Prior in 1980 or by Tebbit; the changes went on and on until they became spiteful and vindictive against the representatives of working people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the party that says that it does not believe in introducing burdens on business that it introduced legislation that insisted that, every three years, company managements should write to those employees who had agreed to have their union deductions paid through their pay packets to remind them that they had the right not to pay under the check-off legislation and that a letter should be sent to employees every time subscriptions increased. That was done by the party that does not believe in burdening business, but it is the party that abolished works councils and said the reason for cutting the wage of cleaners on low pay was that they have to compete in the labour market, but that that is a reason for increasing the pay of executives and high fliers. That party was, in the end, scrambling around for

something else to do on the back of its winter of discontent scenario.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it was Labour's winter of discontent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about the Conservative scenario, although I agree that there were problems on both sides. The Conservative party introduced legislation that provided that wage slips no longer had to inform workers when their pay rates changed. That is how nasty it became. So I will not listen to any lecture about not placing burdens on business, because the Conservative's anti-union measures, not least the check-off legislation, was a burden on business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party might think that the opt-out from the social chapter was the greatest achievement of the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major)—not that there is a great range to choose from—but it should be remembered that the European works council directive was agreed when the previous Government were in power. They were round the tables in all the discussions in the European Parliament, but they chose to opt out and not to have anything to do with it. That meant that they had no influence it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measures of the European social chapter are extremely modest. We always hear them described as the thin end of the wedge, but this Government will ensure that we influence the debate and that British workers are not left out of advances that are made in other countries. It is not a cause for crowing by Conservative Members that they obtained the opt-out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We perfectly agree that the content of the social chapter at the moment is not great, but we have found that European countries place much greater burdens on their businesses than we do. If I owned a business in France or Germany, I would be saying to my Government, "You have put this burden or this tax on me for training or whatever. I want to make sure that there is a level playing field throughout the EU, so you must make sure that it goes into the social chapter." That is where the pressure will come from. As night follows day, in years to come the Minister will be saying to Committees such as this what a good idea this extra burden or that extra burden is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that point, simply because the social chapter does not operate on the basis that the social partners go away and do whatever they want. They are constrained by the directive. It prescribes that measures must not damage employment opportunities and it includes references to small businesses. That is why it is difficult for Conservative Members to oppose the measures that have come through. To their shame, they do it, but the right to parental leave, for example, and the right for part-timers to be paid the same pay as full-timers are fundamental human rights. I repeat: no centre-right party elsewhere in Europe would dream of opposing them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not realise that regulation and interference have a cumulative effect on business? It is all very well to itemise one thing, but he
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
will know only too well from last week's British Chambers of Commerce report that the bill for the regulation that his Government have imposed on business, primarily through employment legislation, tots up to £9.8 billion so far in this Parliament alone, and that is not taking account of £2.4 billion in recurring charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister cannot see that, does he ever reflect on the fact that non-wage labour costs in the rest of Europe have been significantly higher than in the UK? According to his Department's own figures, that is one of the key reasons why the UK is chosen for inward investment in Europe over other member states. By helping us play catch-up with everyone else, he is storing up problems for the future. That is fine while the economy is going well, but in the long run it will translate into UK job losses. The Minister seems unable to take a long-term view of these measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is this. This country is alone in Europe, thanks to the previous Government who tried to make it into the sweatshop of Europe by saying, "Come and locate in Britain. You can exploit the work force here because there is no minimum wage, no maximum working week and no right to equal pay for part-timers." The hon. Lady referred to other European countries, but Holland, for example, has a much lower unemployment rate than this country and a much better economic record, but it has operated minimum civilised standards for its work force as second nature for at least the past 40 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I completely reject Conservative Members' argument. In my short time on the Trade and Industry Committee, I was lucky enough to be able to ask people who were responsible for attracting inward investment into the UK what measures they looked for. Pay and conditions did not come up once—it did not register on their Richter scales. What did were the skills of the local work force, the help that investors received in relocating and the environmental and planning laws that affected them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Tynan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hamilton, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that although there are many good employers in the UK, there are others who need this kind of regulation to bring about the fair conditions that are necessary for people who are working in partnership with their employers to create the efficiencies and conditions that will enable industry to be successful? Does he agree that it is only because some employers need this type of regulation that the Government have to legislate in this way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point about the advantages that businesses gain from consulting and informing their employees, in terms of morale and convincing people to change. Change is a huge issue. The work force needs to change. The environment is changing. Technology is changing. Consultation and sharing information with the work force at the appropriate time is an important mechanism for change. Unfortunately, some employers are still living in the dark ages as far as this kind of measure is concerned. They would not agree with the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton that the work force should be informed. My hon.

Friend the Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Tynan) is right; we do need this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister will not recognise that the competitiveness of UK companies as a result of the lower non-wage labour costs on UK companies over the years under the last Conservative Government is a significant factor, to what does he attribute the austerity plan that is having to be imposed in Germany and the 35 hour week in France? What is the reason for that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady may have forgotten reunification. Reunification was the most remarkable achievement. Germany, I remind the hon. Lady, is still 40 per cent. ahead of us on productivity and France is 20 per cent. ahead of us on productivity. The current economic cycle cannot be used to establish any great theories one way or the other.

I have two points to make about the regulations. We have debated many things and it has been very enjoyable, but we have not debated the regulations. Not many questions were raised, but I would like to take up the point made by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare who asked about the numbers involved. I was grateful for the support of the Liberal Democrats for these measures. There are 120 UK-based companies already covered by the directive. The previous Government negotiated an opt-out. They did not do very well for British businesses because they were dragged into this by the fact that it operated abroad, and the fact that the UK did not influence at all was a major complaint of many of those companies. Approximately 110 UK-based companies—it has gone down by one since my earlier speech—will for the first time be affected by the coming into force of the regulations. We are talking about 110 companies coming on stream for the first time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These regulations introduce the sensible minimum standards for informing and consulting employees at
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
European level set out in the European works council directive and do so without introducing excessive burdens on business. They are not seen as controversial in the business community. They are recognised as providing a common base for information and consultation at European level. They draw on the actual experience of UK companies that are in any case already subject to the directive and have successfully introduced its provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The approach that the regulations take is flexible and leaves existing agreements that include the UK employees undisturbed. Where there is no agreement in place and the employees want one, it is up to the companies and employees to negotiate an agreement that is suited to their own particular circumstances. Only if agreement cannot be reached do the fall-back arrangements set out in the schedule apply. I ask the Committee to support the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
