	<p>9.55 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for School Standards (Ms Estelle Morris)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 70) on Threshold Payments (HC Paper No. 963).</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 71) on Leadership Group Payments (HC Paper No. 964).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that I have had the privilege of serving under your chairmanship, Mr. Olner, and although I very much look forward to it, I am happy to make the experience a short one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a little overlap between this Committee and the Committee that considered similar grants, so one or two of us have been through these matters before. However, I should remind Committee members that the special grants replace those that were considered in the previous Committee, but withdrawn in the light of the judicial review in September.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the background to both reports is our drive to strengthen the teaching profession. Central to any increase in standards must be a good and well rewarded teaching profession with a career structure and pay structure that attracts, retains and motivates people who make good teachers. That fact was reported in the Green Paper on reform of the teaching profession, the proposals arising from it, and the special grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members know, the High Court judgment in July required that we put the performance threshold arrangements for teachers on a statutory footing, and we have worked hard to do that. I pay tribute to those who have been engaged in the consultation process since the school teachers review body reported. Their willingness to work quickly is enabling us to get the system back on track.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pay and conditions order that was made yesterday—22 November—establishes the new upper pay scale for classroom teachers. Nearly all teachers on that scale will be promoted to it by passing the threshold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to give schools the confidence to retain and recruit experienced and effective teachers. We remain committed, therefore, to providing additional funds to
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
cover the extra costs resulting from teachers moving to the upper pay scale. That is the purpose of the threshold grants that are described in report No. 70.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Payments are based on the number of teachers who have applied for assessment at the threshold, rather than the number who were successful at the threshold. We have always said that there will be no rationing of threshold success—the number who pass will be the number who will be funded. Therefore, at the moment we cannot assume a pass rate, and we can base payments only on the number of teachers who have applied to cross the threshold. At a later date, we will make the necessary adjustments to the finance in the light of those who are successfully assessed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Allan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us how many people currently pass the threshold?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot and it would be wrong to do so. There is no quota, and we do not instruct assessors to allow either a minimum or maximum number through. Like the teachers, we await the results of the assessors' deliberations. That is why the decision in today's order is to fund local authorities according to the maximum number of teachers who can get through. The clawback arrangements will be made a little later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each local authority will receive a monthly payment reflecting the number of full-time equivalent teachers in those schools that have applied. You will notice, Mr. Olner, that the report sets out the relevant information according to each local authority. The sum will be based on the £2,001 salary increase awarded to teachers promoted to the upper pay scale, together with a 17.8 per cent. allowance for related national insurance and pension contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the initial payments are made in December, local authorities will receive four times their monthly amount in that month. So LEAs will have enough money not only to provide schools with the December payment, but to make payments backdated to 1 September, the date from which the pay increase will take effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Payment based on applicant numbers also explains why the grant period is so short. Threshold assessment starts again this week, and assessors will be working flat out to cover as many schools as possible in the next few months. In our judgment, by the end of February sufficient applications should have been validated to produce a reliable estimate of the pass rate in each LEA. Having reached that point, it would not be right to continue payment on the basis of applicant numbers. That is why the provisions of special grant report No. 70 conclude at the end of February, and the second report, mentioned in annexe B, comes in. The second report will provide for grants based on emerging and actual success rates, to bring the money paid to LEAs into line with what is needed to pay actual threshold costs. In doing so, it will of course take into account what LEAs will have already received under special grant report No. 70. We want to do our best to ensure that local authorities have the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
extra money as soon as the pay order establishing the upper pay scale comes into force in mid-December. That is why this report is being debated now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to draft a report that also provided for payments adjusted in line with success rates, we would have needed to be pretty sure about the number of successful teachers. Our challenge was to begin consulting on the first payments as far back as October, so that the report could be approved now. We shall therefore need to discuss the second grant as part of another consultation process and in the light of estimated success rates, so that we can lay a further order before the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Special grant report No. 71 is equally straightforward. Its purpose is to help schools to create a broader leadership group by contributing to the cost of appointing teachers to the new grade of assistant head. It contributes a payment of £2,000 plus on-costs to the cost of appointing assistant head teachers in the current school year. In other words, it is a pump-priming grant to help schools that want to create such new management posts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be up to each school, in the light of its size and management responsibilities, to decide how many teachers should be assistant head teachers. Head teachers will take that decision in the light of competing demands on their management structure and financial resources. Management and leadership is key to the success of schools, and we want to encourage them properly to use the post of assistant head. That is why we provided pump-priming money of £2,000 plus on-costs for this year. Of course, a demand-led payment that continues year after year is not the same as the threshold assessment, for which there are external standards and assessment procedures. The heads must decide how to allocate resources in terms of staffing structure, but it has been our task this year to encourage and assist them in moving towards the new management structure by contributing £2,000 plus on-costs under special grant report No. 71.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both special grant reports provide essential support for the new career and pay structure for teachers, and the new structure itself makes a vital contribution to strengthening the profession and raising standards. I commend both reports to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.2 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Theresa May 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Maidenhead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, too, say what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr. Olner? I should tell Committee members that that pleasure has been afforded me because the wife of my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) is giving birth, perhaps even as we speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister will know, we have some concerns about the way in which the Government have introduced this performance-related pay scheme for teachers, as well as its operation. It is cumbersome and overly bureaucratic, and is in many ways a civil servant's idea of a national performance-related pay scheme that bears little relevance to the way in which such schemes operate in the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Nevertheless, we believe that good teachers should be rewarded, and it is important to give schools the flexibility to ensure that classroom teaching is recognised and rewarded. The attempt to move away from a system that rewards teachers purely on the basis of taking on extra responsibility is important. A way must be found of recognising and rewarding good classroom teachers. We have reservations about the overall scheme and the bureaucracy and cost involved in running it. Nevertheless, I recognise that the special grant reports introduce the performance-related pay scheme that has now been agreed. I say "now agreed" because the Government have had one or two little local difficulties on the matter, to which the Minister alluded in relation to the High Court judgment in July. That little local difficulty would not have arisen had the Government not been so keen to bypass Parliament and proper scrutiny and discussion of their proposals. I trust that the Secretary of State has taken to heart the comments made by the judge in his decision. He clearly set out his concerns about the way in which the Government are bypassing Parliament and not allowing proper time to debate and discuss issues as important as the pay structure for the teaching profession. We must ensure that high-quality people—and more of them—enter the teaching profession. The continuing recruitment problems and vacancies are causing considerable practical difficulties for schools. We wait to see whether such a bureaucratic scheme will solve those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Special grant report No. 70 relates to the basic cost of moving teachers across the threshold into the upper pay scale. I have several questions about the practicalities of that. The Minister referred to the fact that grants will be based on applications rather than on the number who successfully cross the threshold. Will she say when she expects the first teachers to receive additional money as a result of payments to local authorities? Is it expected that as soon as somebody has been deemed successful in passing through the threshold, he or she will transfer to the new pay scale and be paid, regardless of whether there are other teachers at the same school whose cases have not been determined or are subject to an appeal? Will that be done on an individual basis or on a school basis, regardless of whether decisions relating to certain schools within a local authority have yet been taken? Some teachers might know where they stand while other teachers do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of basing the figures on applicants rather than those who successfully pass through the threshold, I recognise the Minister's dilemma. However, that raises two issues. First, if a local authority is given extra money on the basis of the number of applicants, some of whom may not be successful, it will be necessary to claw back money from the authorities. Annexe C refers to overpayment of grant being repaid by the authority to the Secretary of State. Will the Minister say when that repayment would be expected to take place? Secondly, the implication is that the Government expect all applicants to be successful, therefore it is easy to base grants on the number of applicants because the vast
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
majority of applicants, if not all of them, will pass through the threshold, and the amount of overpayment will be small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Head teachers have told me that they are concerned about their training in the procedure. I use the word "training" loosely, given some of the comments that I have heard about meetings at which those doing the training could not answer head teachers' questions. They rang up the Department for Education and Employment, but the staff there were also unable to provide answers. That is hardly high-quality training. I have been told that some head teachers were concerned about the attitude that was taken during the training sessions and about comments implying that all applicants were expected to go through the threshold and on to the upper pay scale. That would make life difficult for head teachers who have approached the matter properly by assessing their staff to determine those who should go through the threshold and qualify and those who are not yet ready, although they may wish to apply in future. In some cases, heads will tell all those who want to apply to do so; in others, they will discourage applications from those whom they do not believe would get through—perhaps suggesting that they wait another year and work on certain development issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a head teacher sees that all applicants from other schools get through, their authority in their own school will be undermined. Teachers who were discouraged from applying because the head told them that they were not ready will say, "Everyone in the school next door applied and got through—why did you stop me?" I am worried about the practical impact on head teachers if all applicants in a certain area get through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On overpayment, annexe C refers to the need for an audit confirming that the authority has used the grant solely for the purposes specified in the report. However, if the authority is sitting on a sum of money, some of which then has to be paid back and cannot be used for such purposes, to what use can it put the money while it has it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the Minister's point about the need to finish the process in February. As she said, point 5 of annexe B states that a further special grant report will be produced to continue the scheme beyond the end of February. What period of operation would be stipulated by that report? Would it be the next financial year or more open-ended than that? I know that she will say that Ministers have made statements about the matter in the House. However, head teachers and local authorities want to ensure that money is available on an on-going basis, not merely for the two years for which the initial ring-fenced money was provided. The money should be not only nominally available, but actually available, otherwise it is possible that after the end of the ring-fenced period it could return to the standard spending assessment and would no longer be a ring-fenced sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Local authorities have had much experience of hearing Government claims about the availability of funding and then finding that it is not reflected in the rate support grant. Some authorities have recently been told that they will receive an increase of 5.5 per cent. for education expenditure. I dare say that the Secretary of State will be writing to education authorities—as he has for the past two years—about his hope and expectation that they will ensure that their education budgets rise by that amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, Wokingham district council's revenue support grant will increase by only 1.5 per cent.—it would have to find at least £2 million in order to increase education by the headline sum that was announced by the Secretary of State and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The fact that a sum of money is in the SSA does not mean that it is actually available to local authorities. Many authorities fear that at the end of the ring-fencing of the money against which the grants would be drawn, funding will return nominally into the SSA and will not be available to them in a real sense, thus potentially causing them serious problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen after the period of the report expires? How many people will be covered by it, given that it is based on those who apply, not on those who are successful in going through the threshold?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify how long she would expect the process to take for a teacher who has requested that their rejected application be looked at again? That will have an impact on the repayment of any overpayment of grant by the local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to what the Minister said on leadership groups and the new structure set out in special grant report No. 71, which are different from the grants given in special grant report No. 70. It is not an on-going grant for people who have gone on to an upper pay scale; it enables head teachers to take one-off decisions to appoint teachers to the new position of assistant head teacher. Leadership grants and the post of assistant head teacher raise practical problems in schools, first, because of the relative nature of the assistant head teacher's responsibilities and position, compared with other members of the senior management team, particularly deputy heads. The second reason is much more practical: as the Minister has made clear, the grant gives merely a one-off payment to schools to encourage them to kick start the process of appointing new assistant head teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to a point similar to the one that I made in regard to special grant report No. 70, many schools and local authorities may well say, "It is all very well giving £2,356 to kick start the process of appointing an assistant head, but what happens thereafter?" The Minister said that it is for head teachers to decide how to spend their budgets, but head teachers' budgets are strapped and they often find it difficult to pay even the staff that they need and want. Many schools have real difficulties with their budgets because money is held back by central Government and local education authorities. Heads will look twice at the issue if they do not know how they will continue to fund the post of assistant head after they have been enabled to kick
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
start it. If the Minister cannot give schools more comfort, she may find that many heads will be wary of taking up the opportunity and that the move towards the appointment of assistant heads may be held back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of how assistant heads will fit in with the overall structure of the senior management team within a school and the responsibilities that they will be expected to take on. The grant will run from now until August 2001. Does the Minister have any expectations of the numbers of assistant heads that could be appointed over that period and in what phases?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must respond to several practical questions if schools are to know confidently where they stand in relation to payments to teachers. As I have said, the Opposition feel that the scheme is cumbersome, bureaucratic, imposes a heavy administrative cost and, in terms of the payments that will be made this year, is less about performance-related pay than about getting some teachers onto a different pay scale. That is not simply my judgment but that of Professor Richardson, who did work for the London School of Economics and for the National Union of Teachers on that issue. Certainly in the initial phases, and potentially thereafter, it is not a performance-related pay scheme as most people would understand that; it does not allow for the payment of extra sums and rewards to teachers, or measurement of their performance against objectives that have been set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is bureaucratic and the Government have got into difficulties with it. We would not have had to meet in Committee if the Government had not bypassed Parliament and had a High Court judgment against them. If the Government had taken the process through properly in the first place, teachers could have received their extra pay from September rather than having to wait to put the measure put through on the basis of applicants. Local authorities will be given money before they know how many teachers in their area will receive payments, and so will then have to pay the Government back. That is extra administration caused by the Government choosing to bypass Parliament and proper consultation, and to impose their decision on teachers and others. They should have discussed and consulted properly on the scheme to enable teachers to be rewarded, and should have ensured that it was right. Instead, we have an over-bureaucratic and cumbersome scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Allan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are interesting provisions. One could not oppose them because they give extra money to local education authorities and schools, but we have fundamental objections to the scheme that they are designed to reimburse. We must ask some important questions about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the comments of the hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) on special grant report No. 71, I ask what feedback the Minister has had from schools about the posts of assistant head. Have schools told the Department for Education and Employment
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
that they are happy with the incentive and are appointing assistant heads? Have they suggested reluctance to appoint people to higher salary scales because there is no guarantee of funding beyond this financial year? I share concern about that with the hon. Lady. While we are considering the funding paper, it would be helpful to hear feedback from schools if the Minister has had it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to special grant report No. 70, will the Minister suggest what the mechanism will be in future for funding LEAs and schools for the threshold payments? Will there be a special grant report each year for the foreseeable future, or does she have some other mechanism in mind to reward or fund schools for the payments to teachers? As the mainstream funding for schools goes through a Department other than her own, a complex mechanism may be required. Special grant reports are not the ideal way to fund a core service. We have seen on the funding of services to refugees that special grant reports can continue for several years. That is not in the public interest; it is far more accountable to have funding for a permanent feature in the mainstream budgets rather than tacking it on at a later stage in a separate report. If she gives us an idea of how the mechanism will work, it will help us to scrutinise the spending of money in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will changes to the threshold payments be made in future? At the moment, there is a £2,000 flat payment. Will there be some links to other pay salaries? Will payments go through the school teachers' review body? The Government are sensitive about getting consultation right, having had a bloody nose over the implementation procedure in the first place. What thought have the Government given to how the threshold payments may be adjusted in future? Who will decide what the level will be? I assume that it will not stay at a flat £2,000 for ever, or its effectiveness will be whittled away by inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister re-state the full payment guarantee? We have asked Ministers to do so several times but, when we are considering the funding of LEAs and schools, it is always helpful for them to state on record that the Government will guarantee that payments made under the scheme in future will be in addition to other education funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Government consider any relationship between the grants as made and the educational need in some areas? I shall pick out Sheffield and Leeds from the report. Sheffield has had 2,427 applicants and will receive a payment of £419,531 a month, and Leeds has had 3,347 applicants and will receive a payment of £578,561 a month. If the payments are proportional, my quick calculation is that Leeds will receive almost £2 million more than Sheffield over the period. I have nothing against Leeds, and I know that the LEAs there are roughly the same size as those in Sheffield, but I suspect that Sheffield is probably in greater need, being an objective 1 area and having well known problems of social deprivation. Leeds has its own problems, but I suspect that, on a simple scale, Sheffield would be higher up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
There may be some conflict if payments are based purely on the number of applicants rather than other objective criteria. That may run counter to the Government's stated policy of funding areas of the highest educational need at the highest levels. We may see more applicants applying in one area than another. I have picked out Leeds because I suspect that it is roughly comparable with Sheffield, although we cannot get the exact figures because the local education authorities are not listed with the numbers of pupils or teachers in their schools. I suspect that there may be even broader differences between some of the shire counties and some of the inner city areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The payments are supposed to have educational benefits in terms of the retention of experienced teachers. I am concerned that we may end up with a scheme where the money going into education, albeit through payments to teachers, may be diverted into areas of less rather than greater need, or be spent in an unequal fashion that does not mesh entirely with the Government's stated aim of directing the money to where the need is greatest. That is my principal concern, having seen the figures, and I hope that the Minister will be able to assure us that the question of whether or not the threshold payments are contributing to the areas of greatest need will be thoroughly researched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm the name of the scheme? We have seen different names used. Does PRP mean performance-related promotion or performance-related pay? It would be helpful to know which—there is a distinction to be made. I have seen both names used, and I would like the Minister to tell me what she now understands the name of the scheme to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.26 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Casale 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wimbledon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to voice my support for my right hon. Friend the Minister and the special grants that she is introducing. The grants will be important to those local authorities that will incur additional costs in seeking to drive up standards in our schools and improve exam results. Under these measures, up to £77,441 a month extra will be payable to Merton local education authority, the LEA that serves my constituency. That will be welcome news to parents and teachers in Wimbledon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to recognise that special circumstances require special treatment. In that connection, I draw my right hon. Friend the Minister's attention to an anomaly that exists in relation to six outer-London boroughs, including Merton, with regard to teachers' pay. Teachers in Merton are paid inner-London weighting, and rightly so, to cover the high cost of living in certain parts of the borough, but, by contrast, the local education authority is not compensated for the additional cost of those payments. That can lead to an annual shortfall in the education budget of up to £1 million, at a time when Merton LEA is restructuring the school system by changing from a three-tier system to a two-tier system
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
and working to raise standards by implementing in full the many new measures introduced by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for the reimbursement of the inner-London weighting to teachers by the six outer-London boroughs is similar to the case for special grants before the Committee. I hope that my right hon. Friend will do all that she can to ensure the introduction of a special grant to cover the circumstances in Merton and those other boroughs that I have described, whereby the payment of inner-London weighting to teachers is not reflected in the education grant given to the local authority. Could a measure similar to the one under discussion be introduced to sort out that anomaly and give us the money that we need to continue successfully to raise standards in our schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.28 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start on a note of agreement. I hope that the hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) will convey my best wishes to her friend the hon. Member for South Holland and the Deepings (Mr. Hayes). I hope that the child will arrive safely during Education and Employment questions, if not during the Committee. I hope that all goes well and I look forward to hearing the results of this morning's activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maidenhead raised the question of how the grants are paid. I suppose that, if I had presented to the Committee an order that ran any risk of leaving the local authority short when the first payments were made, I should have been in trouble. I should have been asked why we did not ensure that local authorities would be covered for the maximum amount that they might pay. We wanted to be true to our word that we would make the necessary resources available. Funding is related to the number of applicants because that comes to the greatest amount of money that might need to be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never expected everyone to pass. However, I did not want to have to make two sets of judgments. Inevitably, guesses would sometimes be wrong. Also, I did not want the profession to receive the message that a quota was being operated. We never intended to impose a quota, but the profession was slow to accept that and much work has been done to allay those fears. In addition, we should have had to make adjustments anyway. It made most sense for the initial funding to be set at the greatest possible amount that local authorities could have to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have always said that we expect most teachers, over time, to pass the threshold standards. However, I should be very surprised if that were true for every teacher. Hon. Members should remember that this year is exceptional, in that some teachers who are applying for assessment may have been teaching for 20, 25 or 30 years. In future, it is likely to be teachers who have been teaching for seven, eight or nine years who apply. Perhaps—I do not know, and it is of academic interest only—the pattern of success will be different this year. We shall have to monitor that and I have not made a judgment on it. It does not exercise
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
us greatly, because we are concerned with judging the performance of the teacher against the threshold standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that a feeling exists that everyone will be nodded through. That does not tally with what was said initially about teachers' fears that no one would pass. If the hon. Lady thinks that there has been a shift from a general belief that no one will pass to a belief that everyone will pass, that suggests to me a lack of security with respect to the new system. Teachers have put great effort into completing their application forms and heads have taken seriously their obligation to assess them. I think that they have done this in a professional way. Their judgments will be made just as the hon. Lady described, in the light of the application form and the head's knowledge of the teacher's performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scoring points is all very well, but I expect that all parties would agree that the teachers who are successful deserve their success. They should be acclaimed and rewarded, and they should welcome their pay increase and view it as an achievement and a mark of professionalism. I should regret any undermining of their achievement by people saying that it was easy to pass because the message came from Government to nod them through. That is not true. A proper assessment is being conducted and people who pass should feel proud and pleased that society has noted their professionalism and rewarded them for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to readjusting the payments, timing is quite important. Some teachers have already been assessed as part of the vanguard, particularly in Bradford where the local authority was being reorganised and the heads would not have been in a position to deal with the matter post-September. Some others were in the vanguard as well, because we wanted to test the system before the summer holidays. Those cases were put on hold, although the assessor had visited. The papers were locked in a safe. Because the standards have not changed, those assessments will stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today the assessments have restarted. Seven or nine schools are receiving visits from the assessor today. The assessor who is making a visit examines a sample of the applications in detail, but endorses the whole system. When the assessor leaves a decision will have been made and confirmed for every teacher in the school. The school will then fill in a simple form that lists the names of those teachers who have passed the threshold. It will then be sent immediately to the local education authority and the payment will be made that month. Given that teachers in a school receive their pay at the same time, there cannot be any possibility of the school letting the LEA know that Mrs. Smith has passed and Mr. Brown has not. However, each school will be treated differently. Assessors are not attached to the LEAs; they will be sent to the schools. Although teachers in the same school will receive payment at the same time, different schools in the LEA will not necessarily do so. That will depend on when the assessors call at the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the assessor calls is determined by the point at which the head made the assessment. Some heads book assessor visits quickly, while some move more
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
slowly. I do not know whether some heads have been carrying on with the assessment during the freeze. Their unions recommended that they do that, but some may not have done. Certain factors must be taken into account. If the order is passed, we anticipate that local authorities will receive the money for the first payment to be made to those schools in the vanguard in the December pay packet. We are working flat out with Cambridge Education Associates to get the assessors into schools during the next couple of weeks and, if all goes according to plan, some will receive the first payment by December. We hope that all schools will receive their payments by Easter, although I do not want to be a hostage to fortune in terms of the CEA being able to manage those visits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As for the speed at which the payment can be made, has the Minister received assurances from all the LEAs that their payment systems will be able to cope? Unfortunately, some local authority payment systems have had a history of going wrong at various points of change. If the commitment had been given, it would be embarrassing if, for some reason at the local authority level, the payments could not be made in time for Christmas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard nothing from local authorities that gives me any cause for doubt that the payments will not be made. What makes the position easier is that the payment is not calculable, but a given amount. Under the formula, the sum that will go into teachers' pay packets is £2,001. There is no reason why that cannot be included in the monthly pay packet. Local authorities have certainly not expressed doubts that such payments cannot be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for setting out in some detail the timing of the payment. She will be aware that the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers said that it would be willing to support members who wish to take legal action if they were not allowed through the process in lieu of what the union considered to be an appropriate appeals procedure. If a teacher took legal action, would the money be put on hold at the local authority? How would the process work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the form was sent to the local authority, it would be silly to make it public as a person might appeal successfully. If the outcome of the review were that the teacher did cross the threshold, adjustments would be made. I have no idea how many reviews there will be, but I speculate that many teachers who do not pass through the threshold will reapply the next year. The position will be different from that of the re-grading of nurses. Teachers will be able to reapply the following year. I do not think that there will be many such reviews. There will not be a sufficient number to cause us huge problems in ensuring that the payment is made. If teachers seek a review and are then judged to have reached the appropriate standard, we would not wish to hold up their payment. It is in our interests and in the interests of teachers to get the money into their pay packets as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
soon as possible. As long as proper assessment is made and there is rigorous evaluation, we shall get the money into teachers' pay packets when we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for readjusting future payments, the next grant will last for the next financial year. It will ensure that the present mechanism of paying the threshold will operate in that way. There is a real dilemma, which I shall link with the concerns of hon. Members about payments for the leadership grant. We want to ensure that threshold payments are clearly identified—we have always used the phrase "clearly identified"—and we shall do that during the first couple of years through the mechanism that we are now discussing and in the light of the changes to local authority and school funding proposed in the Green Paper. We have never said that orders will be laid annually from now into the distant future. We want to reflect on the system when it is established and talk to the profession, head teachers and local authorities about a funding mechanism. The matter must be discussed, but we have always said that the payments would be clearly identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dilemma is the balance between earmarked funding and giving head teachers the freedom to spend the money as they want. The Tories must come to terms that that dilemma. They are always talking about it, but they cannot have it both ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the payment to local education authorities on 15 February will be in the March pay packet? If the next grant report refers only to the next financial year, it will presumably start from April. I presume that the monthly payments are in advance of payments in the pay packet rather than for payments in the same month. The report suggests that the February payment will be for February's pay packets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall receive a note if I am wrong, but when I checked that yesterday it seemed to make sense. February is not the end of the financial year, but we believe that we shall have sufficient indication of likely pass rates to make the adjustments. We did not want to continue making payments to applicants for too long. Payments for February will be made in February and the next order will be for March until the end of the next financial year. That must be so, because otherwise, as the hon. Lady said, it would leave March with no payments and that would not make sense. I also wondered why payments would be made in February and not at the end of the financial year, and the reason is to introduce a proper mechanism as soon as possible. Any clawback will be achieved by adjusting the next month's payment in the light of the money that has already been received. It cannot be spent on anything else, so it will be used in future months and the money received from us will reflect any overpayment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point raised by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan), the Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts), tells me that Leeds is much larger than
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Sheffield, but I shall leave that to be argued between Sheffield and Leeds. The difference relates not to need, but to the number of teachers. There are many ways in which we provide more money to Leeds and Sheffield and the difference in need between the two is an interesting Yorkshire debate in which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State occasionally engages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The grant is based on the number of teachers and one factor that may affect it is the age of the teaching force. If, for example, a local authority has many young teachers who are not yet at level 9, there may not be many applicants. However, the money goes straight into the pay packets of teachers and not to the authority to use on raising standards or coping with poverty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the exact figures, but I am concerned that the payments may reflect different rates of applications in different parts of the country. If, for example, teachers in the leafy shires were much more ready to apply than those in inner-city areas, the net effect within a fixed education budget would be that, although the money would still go to teachers and would still have an educational benefit in respect of the retention of experienced teachers, it would be easier to retain experienced teachers in areas of less need, because of the money going through, than in areas of greatest need. We want to tease out whether the Government are considering that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not reflected on that, but now that we know the number of applications by local authorities, it would be interesting to find out why in some local authority areas the number of eligible people who apply is low. Some people took the decision not to apply, and others wanted to see how the system bedded in. I should be surprised if there were a huge difference between LEAs, but there is a difference between schools. We shall reflect on what the difference in local authorities might mean; we are pretty good at looking at data and trying to use it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return now to special grant report No. 71. As we concluded when we discussed the report first time around, given that the threshold is set against national standards, assessed outside the school and demand-led, an assurance of quality is needed, otherwise there is no mechanism to prevent a school from—in the worst case—just nodding people through and no incentive to use rigour in that assessment. A huge amount of taxpayers' money is being spent; safety in respect of the threshold depends on our being confident about the assessment procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The size of the leadership group and the number of assistant heads are not set against national standards; the alternative would have been to devise a formula providing that if there are X pupils with X per cent. receiving free school meals, there can be X people on the management scheme. That would have been terrible for heads, who should decide on their own management structure; some want flatter structures, some want the heads of their biggest faculties—maths, English and science—in their leadership group and others do not. I suspect that in some primary schools, only the head will be involved and in slightly larger
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
primary schools it will be the head and the deputy. The starting point is that heads must have the right to manage, and a key element of that is deciding what the management group will look like. We could not then insist on a demand-led approach; it would have been silly to say, "Whoever you want to put in that leadership group, we will give you £2,000 a year from now until kingdom come." That would have been irresponsible in terms of public finances. The balance is struck by pump priming: we have given the confidence necessary to run things in the first place. In some schools, the existing senior management team will become the new management team, but it will be entirely up to the schools. It will be interesting to consider such models, however.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schools will have to take decisions in the light of future pressures. For example, some schools now decide between investment in classroom assistants or in teachers, between investment in information and communication technology that can help individualised learning and in teachers. Schools will want to decide between investment in senior staff and investment in classroom staff, and the decision is theirs to take. That is the nature of running a business or a school with a huge budget. We do not want to take away the right of schools to decide; we want to encourage them to be flexible in their management systems. That is why it will be demand-led, but not after the first year. In setting future budgets, which the School Teachers Review Body will also look at, we will consider the pattern of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have answered most of the questions, although I did not respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon (Mr. Casale), for which I apologise. I congratulate him on managing to mention London allowances and some of the challenges and problems facing London boroughs in reports that had nothing to do with that matter, although I accept that
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
they are to do with teachers' pay, recruitment and retention and with rewarding teachers who work in different circumstances.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Education and Employment questions beckon, but I do not want to miss this opportunity to tease out answers to two questions that the Minister has not answered. First, on the future years payment, I want to know whether there will be a £2,000 differential between the teachers' salary scale every year, or if that differential will be adjusted for inflation and, if so, who will do it? Secondly, will the Minister comment on pay or promotion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the matter will be considered by the STRB, so when the STRB looks at the annual pay rate, it will look at the threshold payment.
