	<div class='title'>Competition Act 1998 (Director's Rules) Order 2000</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the Competition Act 1998 (Director's Rules) Order 2000 (S.I., 2000 No. 293).</p></q>
The statutory instrument has been drawn up by the Director General of Fair Trading under sections 51 and 53 of the Competition Act 1998. By virtue of section 71 of that Act, the order is subject to the negative resolution procedure. The Opposition have prayed against it because we feel strongly that it imposes yet another burden on small and medium-sized businesses. It is one more example of the endless stream of new red tape that is emerging unchecked from the present Administration. That burden has cost business an additional £5 billion a year since the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is ironic that we should be debating the order on the day after the Secretary of State told the British Chambers of Commerce conference that the Government wanted to keep administrative costs to a minimum. Not surprisingly, Ian Peters, the deputy director general of British Chambers of Commerce said of that speech:
	<br><q><p>The business community is increasingly sceptical of what the Government says. We heard fine words when Mr. Byers addressed us a year ago. What we really want to see is more positive action.</p></q>
The editorial in today's 	<i>Financial Times</i> says:
	<br><q><p>Business leaders have repeatedly accused the Government recently of failing to match its business-friendly rhetoric with practical actions.</p></q>
That is a common complaint about every Department. The Government talk about deregulation, yet every day they issue regulations like the order before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order provides the detailed rules for making applications to the Director General of Fair Trading for rulings and guidance about whether particular commercial arrangements fall foul of the provisions of the 1998 Act. In particular, it provides for the charging of fees. Those fees and how they are to be charged are the reasons for our objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will recall that, under the Competition Act, abuse of a dominant market position and agreements that restrict competition are prohibited. If a company breaches such a prohibition, it can be fined up to 10 per cent. of its annual turnover. Hon. Members may recall further that, in February, the Government issued a statutory instrument defining turnover as constituting up to three years, thus turning the maximum fine of 10 per cent. of turnover into 30 per cent. of turnover. What was particularly annoying about that instrument was that, when the Competition Act was making its way through
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Parliament, no indication was given that the Government anticipated imposing such a level of fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are substantial sums, which could spell catastrophe for companies. For any company, whether it is small or large, a fine of 30 per cent. of the annual turnover would be absolutely catastrophic. Companies will consequently want to take every step possible to ensure that even the most innocent commercial agreement has been cleared with the Director General of Fair Trading under the advanced clearance procedures contained in sections 13, 14, 21 and 22 of the Competition Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under those provisions, companies can seek guidance or request a decision on whether an agreement or behaviour contravenes the Act. The difference between guidance and a decision is, first, the level of reliance that the company can place upon it and, secondly, the amount of information required by the director general. Obviously, more information is required for a decision than for guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difference also in the fees charged. Under the order, the fee charged by the Office of Fair Trading for guidance is £5,000, but for a more formal decision, the fee is £13,000. Therein lies our concern. Those fees, which are set out in annex 2 to the statutory instrument, are flat fees, regardless of the size of the company or the complexity of the agreement or behaviour being assessed by the Office of Fair Trading. For a large multinational they are tiny and will cause no problems, but for small and medium enterprises they are potentially significant and either will be a heavy burden or will deter the company from making an application. Those companies might not enter into commercial arrangements because they cannot afford either to get them cleared or, because of the potential for crippling fines, not to get them cleared. The agreement in question might be innocent, but the threat of the fines would counsel extreme caution. The provisions therefore act as a deterrent to innovation in the small and medium enterprise sector—the very sector that the Government say they are keenest to encourage. That is another example of rhetoric contradicting policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the Competition Bill was in Committee, the Government were still undecided about whether to charge fees. They were still consulting. I am not sure whom they consulted or whether they listened to the responses, but the CBI, whose views I should have expected to carry some weight with the Government, stated:
	<br><q><p>The CBI does not support the principle of charging for guidance or notifications, noting by comparison that no fees are payable in relation to notifications to the European Commission under Articles 81 and 82. We believe instead that funding for the OFT for the handling of such notifications should come from central funds. Fees if significant may well have the effect of unduly deterring approaches to the OFT which would otherwise be beneficial in achieving the maximum compliance with the new regime.</p></q>
The power to charge fees is contained in section 53 of the Competition Act 1998, which states that the Director General of Fair Trading
	<br><q><p>may charge fees, of specified amounts, in connection with the exercise by him of specified functions.</p></q>
Subsection (2) states
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
	<br><q><p>Rules may, in particular, provide—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(a) for the amount of any fee to be calculated by reference to matters which may include—
	<br><q><p>(i) the turnover of any party to an agreement.</p></q></p></q>
In other words, the Government have the power to charge fees in proportion to the size of the company making the application. They do not have to charge the flat-rate fees in the provision that we are debating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us to the kernel of the issue. The Opposition are not necessarily against the principle of charging for the clearances. There might be a case for sensible charges proportionate to the work involved in assessing the application, or to the size of the company. We do not object to some of the OFT's costs being recouped in that way. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) said in Committee,
	<br><q><p>It is important that businesses feel that they can turn to the competition authority before they begin a practice, or continue a previously approved practice, to ascertain whether it is all right, likely to be wrong, or, in a limited number of cases, a grey area that requires further probing.—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 18 June 1998; c.505.]</p></q>
Our concern is that fees might be set deliberately high, to deter smaller companies from seeking guidance. The Minister, responding to the debate in Committee said:
	<br><q><p>It was also recognised that fees for giving guidance and a decision may be a way of managing the director general's work load.—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 18 June 1998; c.507.]</p></q>
That is almost an admission that the fees will be used to deter a large number of clearance applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the CBI has said,
	<br><q><p>The introduction of such significant fees may be motivated by a desire on behalf of the OFT to discourage both applications for guidance and notifications, to force businesses towards greater self-assessment of their agreements and practices. However, bearing in mind the fact that the Act is a radical departure from previous UK anti-trust legislation, in the early stages of the Act's existence, businesses should be entitled to seek greater legal security without being subjected to the substantial costs which guidance and/or notification would otherwise entail.</p></q>
The effect on small and medium-sized businesses is what most concerns industry and the Opposition. The CBI has expressed its concerns on that point, too. It said:
	<br><q><p>Imposing a flat rate fee on undertaking of whatever size imposes disproportionately heavy burdens on SMEs: it is inappropriate that an SME should have to pay the same level of fee as a FTSE 100 company.</p></q>
The CBI's view is right. It continues by saying:
	<br><q><p>Also, along with the fee, an undertaking will also have to bear professional fees and internal costs in order to prepare an application for guidance/notification. The total cost burden would consequently be extremely onerous for an SME, and may well discourage SMEs from fully developing their businesses.</p></q>
That is the essence of our argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CBI's view is that there should be a different charging regime for smaller companies. If we had been able to table amendments to the statutory instrument, we would have suggested the CBI's proposal—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Under-Secretary might suggest that it is too late but, as he well knows, it is not possible to table amendments to statutory instruments. That is why we object to so much of the legislation coming from the Government by such a procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
The CBI continues:
	<br><q><p>if fees are to be charged, we favour no or greatly reduced fees for businesses with fewer than 250 employees in their entire group, for both applications for guidance and notifications.</p></q>
Section 53 of the Competition Act 1998 gives the director general and the Government the power to charge fees proportionate to the size of the business involved. Flat fees, which we believe to be wrong and which will harm our small and medium enterprise sector, will be charged under the order. I therefore urge the Under-Secretary to take the statutory instrument away, to rethink the fee-charging proposals and to bring it back to the House with a set of fees that are proportionate in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.41 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to be chaired by you, Mr. Sayeed, albeit in a Room that, as the Government Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) just put it, looks as though it has been decorated by the same Indian restaurateur that he goes to in Blackburn. I am not responsible for the decoration of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing in what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) says to make one think that the rules are not a proper exercise of the powers given to the Secretary of State under the legislation. However, I shall try to deal with the issue that troubles the CBI and the hon. Gentleman, the organisation's conduit on the Opposition Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1998 Act expressly provides a power under section 53 for the director general to charge fees, the amounts of which are specified in the rules in connection with the exercise by him of functions similarly specified. The director general has decided to charge fees for the consideration of agreements and conduct notified to him for guidance or a decision as to the position under the prohibitions. That is the most natural exercise of the power to charge fees that one could imagine. Other functions of the OFT and the regulators, for example the pursuit of complaints and the provision of access to files, will be free of charge. Informal advice, which the OFT is already giving to businesses, will also be free.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of formal guidance and decisions, a service is being provided, of which business is free to avail itself, that involves significant cost to the public sector. There is no notification requirement under the Act. It is entirely fair that businesses that wish to notify should bear the cost of having their cases dealt with. The Secretary of State therefore approved the director general's rules in respect of fees. We concluded that there was no reason why the taxpayer or other businesses should fund the costs. The fees will cover just the cost of considering the agreements and the conduct. They will not fund the other costs of enforcing the Act, notably investigations and enforcement action initiated by the director and the sector regulators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggested that the fees—£5,000 for a notification of guidance and £13,000 for a notification of a decision—are too high. They have been calculated using standard Treasury guidance on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
the costs of carrying out the work of the Office of Fair Trading and the regulators and it is believed that those are the costs associated with notifications. I expect that the hourly rates will be substantially less than the rates law firms will charge for advice on business agreements and conduct. I would like to know why the hon. Gentleman feels that a law firm or tax advisers in the City—his former colleagues—can charge substantially higher fees than the Office of Fair Trading for advice which, I bet my bottom dollar, will not be as sound as that of the Office of Fair Trading. We must remember that consideration of the notifications will be a serious matter, which will require detailed investigation and analysis of anti-competitive effects. It is unrealistic to think that the Office of Fair Trading and the regulators can charge negligible sums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggested that the fees have been set at a level to discourage notifications. One merit of charging fees is that it should discourage frivolous notifications. However, the fees have been set at a level to recover the costs of dealing with the notifications, not in order to discourage them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman had a better argument when he suggested lower fees for small and medium-sized businesses. The Act will allow for the amount of the fee to be calculated by reference to turnover. This is something that the OFT and the sector regulators considered carefully. It was the Director General of Fair Trading who carried out the consultation over the level of fees and not the Government. The Office of Fair Trading and the sector regulators have concluded that to vary the fees would not be appropriate as the costs of examining an agreement or conduct will not necessarily depend on the turnover of the business concerned. The Government saw no reason to dissent from that view. In looking at this issue, it is worth bearing in mind the fundamental point that is often missed in discussion of the Act, which was missed by the hon. Gentleman and is often missed by the Opposition Members. Under the jurisprudence, by which the prohibitions will be interpreted, the prohibitions apply only where there is an appreciable effect on competition. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware of that. Almost by definition, small and medium-sized businesses are less likely to have the market power to affect competition appreciably. The Director General of Fair Trading has expressed the view in his guidelines that an agreement will generally have no appreciable effect on competition if the parties combined share of the relevant market does not exceed 25 per cent. An agreement may, of course, still have no appreciable effect at a higher market share. The major exception to this is where the parties are engaged in price fixing or other cartel activities. However, cartels are, of course, not notified, which is unfortunate in my view, so that exception is irrelevant to the issue of notification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was talking about the notification of cartels and price fixing. Inevitably, the Act bears more heavily on bigger businesses with larger market shares. There is much less need for smaller companies to seek the comfort of formal guidance or a decision. That tendency is reinforced by the provision that we have made in secondary legislation to protect small and medium-sized enterprises. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said that the threat of financial penalties was a strong inducement to notify. The Competition Act 1998 (Small Agreements and Conduct of Minor Significance) Regulations 2000 provide immunity from financial penalties to parties to such agreements, save for price-fixing agreements, whose combined turnover does not exceed £20 million. Immunity is also provided in respect of the chapter II prohibition to an undertaking whose turnover does not exceed £50 million. A special regime therefore applies to small and medium-sized enterprises under the Act. That regime should reduce still further the need for them to notify agreements or conduct. In the light of that provision, we saw no need to dissent from the view of the Director General of Fair Trading and of the sector regulators on a single fee for guidance and decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, before the Act came fully into force, there was a degree of uncertainty about how much work the regulators would have to do to consider the cases. Furthermore, there was no solid evidence on which the number of notifications could be estimated. In any case, fee levels should be reviewed regularly. The director general's rules will doubtless have to be revised once we have had experience of their operation. That is more true for the fee levels than

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
for any other aspect of the rules, as experience will give a much better base on which to set them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Cotter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Weston-super-Mare)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made a fair point about small and medium-sized enterprises. I am not sure whether the Minister has fully dealt with the concerns that have been expressed. He accepted that lower fees for small and medium-sized enterprises were generally a good thing and said that turnover had been discussed. The Liberal Democrats have always acknowledged that reasonable business costs should not be put on the Government and then on to the taxpayer, as some of them could be a significant burden. However, there is genuine concern about the regulations. The sort of figures that have been mentioned, such as £5,000 and £13,000, could be a bar to small firms' progression. I did not feel desperately encouraged when the Minister said that the Government had based the fees on standard Treasury guidance. One does not always feel happy about Treasury guidance, as the Treasury tends to try to get whatever money it possibly can. Indeed, I am sure that the Minister has had occasion to fight it. I remain worried about small businesses, which are extremely important. It is rather a shame that we cannot make small amendments to the statutory instrument, but must say yes or no when one might feel that some provisions are relatively satisfactory. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Both the Conservative and Labour parties frequently sit on the fence on several issues, but I shall not pursue that theme because I am sure that you would rule me out of order, Mr. Sayeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfortunate that we must say yes or no to a statutory instrument because one should be allowed to have a considered view and to table an amendment based on that view. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to that point, although it will be difficult for him to satisfy Opposition Members that the proposed fee will not be too high for small businesses. We have to give a basic yes or no answer. In the Committee considering the Competition Bill, the Minister said that there was indecision about the charges, although, the issue could have been discussed and shades of opinion taken into account. I wish to raise those concerns with the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee for long, but given that the hon. Member for Ogmore (Sir R. Powell) and the Minister, another Welsh man, are present, I shall mention that I am concerned about paragraph 26, which relates to time limits and notices. The provisions on giving notices are important, both in terms of getting the law right and in terms of their impact on the functions of the directors and other recipients. Paragraph 26 3(b) sets out several criteria by which notices must be published in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We live in an era of devolution. The Government pay lip-service to devolving powers to the regions and we have a Scottish Parliament and a Welsh Assembly—not very popular with their incipient populations, but Government flagships. I was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
astounded that when the Minister could not say why Cardiff was not included in the list—except for the fact that it does not have its own gazette, which is an omission in its own right—he blithely said that the matter was dealt with from London. That should make the hon. Member for Ogmore and other hon. Members who represent Welsh constituencies cringe because it goes against the Government's ethos to control from London the affairs of Scotland and the Principality of Wales. Out of kindness to the Minister, I shall not mention Plaid Cymru, although I understand that the Labour party and Plaid Cymru are at each other's necks—I mean throats—in the Principality. [HON MEMBERS: "Necks too."] All right necks too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister please explain what will happen to the people of Wales who will be affected by the order? It is all very well to refer to the London, Edinburgh and Belfast Gazettes, but I do not imagine that the 	<i>London Gazette</i> is compelling reading in the valleys of south Wales, central Wales or even in north Wales, especially as I am sure that it is not published in Welsh. Paragraph 26(3)(b) provides that if the notice cannot be published in one of those journals, it must be published in at least one national daily newspaper. What are generally considered to be national newspapers in certain parts of the country may not be national in mid-Wales. People there may prefer to read the 	<i>Western Mail</i> or another regional paper, but the definition in the order does not include such newspapers. That is important to those who will be directly affected and who may fall foul of the order because of the Minister's cavalier attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman tell us if he is about to do something remarkable? Is he about to announce that he has been adopted as Conservative candidate for a seat in south Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is kind, but I am not. I am very happy where I am. However, my sister was born in Ferryside, just outside Carmarthen. I fought a seat in north Wales and, surprisingly, I can speak a little Welsh. If you, Mr. Sayeed, would allow me, I would speak in Welsh to the Committee. I would say, "Thank you for inviting me to this interview. I hope to have the honour of being selected as your candidate." That went down very well in Ceredigion, Delyn, Alyn and Deeside, a constituency that was foolish enough to select me, and Rhondda. But I digress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a serious point to be made, despite the light-hearted nature of the debate. Wales is losing out. As I said, the Minister's cavalier approach that everything can be done from London will not play well in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

for West Cardiff—I am sorry, Mr. Sayeed, I mean West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns)—for his interesting contribution. Despite its levity, it revealed some important points about the publication of the 	<i>London Gazette.</i> I am grateful also for the comments of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister used a barbed comment, saying that I was a conduit for the Confederation of British Industry. I am happy to be a conduit for any group worried about the Government's proposed legislation on trade and industry matters. The Opposition are listening to businesses large and small. We do not simply hear them; we listen. I am happy to raise such matters in Committee, and that is why the Opposition prayed against the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the costs incurred in assessing applications were incurred for business purposes and that business and not the taxpayer should pick up the bill. He also said that other businesses should not bear those costs; rather, they should be borne by the business seeking the notification. We agree; we have no objection to fees being charged. We object to the method of calculating those fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the Treasury standard cost calculation, as did the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter). The Minister said that the fees are the result of that calculation, and that the hourly rates are somewhat lower than the hourly rates charged by City law firms. However, City law firms charge very high fees; they have highly trained experts on their staff, and many small businesses cannot afford to use those firms. That comparison demonstrates a classic misunderstanding of how small firms manage to survive in the real world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that small businesses were exempt from a number of elements of the Competition Act. However, they are not exempt from the price fixing agreement elements of the Act. It is that element of the Act that most concerns businesses, because they will be entering into business arrangements and agreements with all kinds of companies, and they will not necessarily fall within the general exemptions published by the Office of Fair Trading. That is a worry. To say that small businesses are unlikely to be concerned about the penalties in the Competition Act is wrong—they are worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the Minister to say that he wishes deliberately to discourage frivolous notifications is to misunderstand the point. Many applications will not be frivolous; they will be cautious, because companies cannot afford to allow themselves to be fined under the Competition Act. The proposed level of fees will create a feeling of uncertainty about inadvertently falling within the provisions of the Act; that feeling will permeate the small business community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he would consider the fee provisions after two years of operation. It would have been better to have instigated a fee arrangement that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
was free for small businesses in the first two years of operation, because as the provision settles down, it will become more clear what sorts of business agreements will or will not fall within the penalty provisions of the Competition Act. That would have been a far better way to help businesses get to grips with the new legislation. Had they been a business-friendly Government, they would have taken that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am deeply disappointed by the Minister's response. I hope that he will be able to respond to my final points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee by rehearsing my arguments. I heard nothing new from the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. He made those observations in his opening speech, and I have tried to answer them. I fear that he is trying to present himself as the champion of small business, but I have tried to explain why small business will mostly be excluded from the problems. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not know whether the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare heard what I said about the limits and exemptions of the penalties on small businesses, and whether they enter into prohibitions; if he did not, I trust that he will read 	<i>Hansard.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are well aware of the difficulties that small businesses face, but we are also aware that the Office of Fair Trading has to cover its costs. We believe that the fees are proper and that they are set at a level that will cut costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
