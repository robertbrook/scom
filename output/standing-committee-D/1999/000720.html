Local Goverment Finance (Kosovans) Report (No. 68) on the 2000/2001 Special Grant for Kosovan Evacuees (House of Commons Paper No. 636)</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mrs. Barbara Roche)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 68) on the 2000/2001 Special Grant for Kosovan Evacuees (House of Commons Paper No. 636).</p></blockquote>
I warmly welcome you to the Chair, Dr. Kumar. This is the first Committee in which I have had the privilege of serving under your chairmanship. During those wonderful years when I chaired Battersea Labour party, you were its vice-chairman at one stage, but our roles are reversed today and I promise to be on my best behaviour.<br><br>
This special grant is intended to continue provisions for the reimbursement of local authorities in England for additional expenditure incurred in connection with the Kosovan evacuation programme. It is a narrow but important issue of provision to local authorities by way of special grant.<br><br>
The report covers both evacuees under the humanitarian evacuation programme of the United National High Commissioner for Refugees and Government-sponsored medical evacuees. I should make it clear at the outset that eligibility for grants does not extend beyond the initial exceptional leave to enter the United Kingdom that was granted to the evacuees. Kosovan refugees or asylum seekers who arrived in the United Kingdom independently are also ineligible for the grant.<br><br>
The Committee will know that rapid evacuation from Kosovo presented a considerable challenge, to which I am sure that there is general agreement in the Committee that local authorities and many other agencies in the voluntary sector rose splendidly. Between 25 April and 25 June 1999, 4,031 Kosovans, selected on the basis of vulnerability and medical need, arrived in England at the rate of up to 1,000 a week. A further 83 had arrived as priority medical patients with their nuclear families by the close of the programme on 26 June 2000. That brought the total number of Kosovans evacuated to England to 4,114. A further 349 were accommodated in Scotland under similar but separately funded arrangements.<br><br>
The majority of the Kosovans who arrived under HEP were housed initially in reception centres in the north of England and the midlands. The centres were intended to provide short-term accommodation, and many Kosovans moved into the community to lead a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
more independent existence. Later, medical evacuees were more likely to be housed in local authority or private sector accommodation immediately on arrival. Kosovans with leave to remain, like evacuees of other nationalities, have been free to move around the country and to live where they wish. Evacuees were also given the opportunity to return to Kosovo under the explore and prepare programme.<br><br>
The permanent return programme from the United Kingdom began on 26 July 1999 and ended on 25 June 2000. The programme was available to Kosovans who arrived in the UK under the humanitarian evacuation programme and to independent arrivals. All returnees under the programme received a grant, and 2,396 Kosovans, amounting to 54 per cent. of evacuees, returned to Kosovo under that programme.<br><br>
Special Grant Report (No. 49) provided for the reimbursement of local authorities for expenditure incurred during the previous financial year. Following parliamentary approval of the report in January, all interim claims received by the deadline of 24 February were processed by the end of March. Grants paid so far to 40 local authorities for expenditure to 31 December 1999 total £20.8 million. Final audited full-year claims for 1999–2000 are to be submitted by 30 September. We estimate that the total cost of the provisions in Special Grant Report (No. 49) will be £27 million.<br><br>
The special grant report before the Committee involves the means by which local authorities will be reimbursed for additional expenditure incurred during this financial year as a result of the programme. That is the narrow but important subject of today's debate. The report was laid before the House under powers granted to the Secretary of State. Our best estimate of the costs of the new special grant proposals is £7.6 million. That would bring the total cost of the programme over three years to £34.6 million, which is rather less than our original estimate of £45 million.<br><br>
The Home Secretary gave a commitment to local authorities in May 1999 that the Government would reimburse additional expenditure that local authorities incurred in respect of Kosovan evacuees. The report will ensure that that commitment continues to be met. We have worked closely with the Local Government Association and local authorities on the report's timing and content. Final audited claims are to be submitted by 30 September 2001 and local authorities are requested to submit interim claims, for the period from 1 April to 30 June, by 30 September 2000. The bulk of expenditure for the year will occur in that period. The proposals in annex C allow for prompt reimbursement. The report sets out the categories of expenditure that can be claimed. I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.38 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Lidington <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aylesbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join the Minister in welcoming you to the Chair, Dr. Kumar. I now understand why you and I were hanging around the Upper Committee Corridor earlier this afternoon.<br><br>

The Opposition do not intend to oppose this report—it is important for payments to be authorised and made to the relevant local authorities as swiftly and efficiently as possible. However, I have a few questions for the Minister. First, I hope that she will explain in a little more detail the situation faced by Kosovans who came to this country under the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees programme. How many left voluntarily, how many remain in the United Kingdom and what is the status of those who remain in our immigration and asylum system?<br><br>
In preparation for this afternoon's debate, I examined our previous special grant debate on 26 January and some written answers. According to the figures that I came up with, 4,346 people had come here under either humanitarian or medical evacuation programmes. I think that that figure was used in the debate in January. Probably we could agree on a number somewhat below 4,500. The people concerned had exceptional leave to remain for up to 12 months.<br><br>
In recent weeks, written answers and newspaper reports have given different estimates of the number of people who have departed voluntarily. I understood the Minister of State to tell the Committee that more than half of the Kosovan people originally evacuated to the United Kingdom had now left for Kosovo. I hope that she will be able to advise us later how many people remain here, according to the Government's estimates. I understand that the period in which Kosovans would be eligible for a relocation grant from the Home Office has elapsed, and that they would not have that additional financial incentive to return home.<br><br>
What is the current status of the Kosovans who remain? I believe that a certain number have applied for an extension of leave to remain, and in some cases there may be proper medical or other exceptional compassionate reasons for granting such status. I am aware of other people having claimed asylum although I do not know the numbers. One suspects, because the figures do not add up to anything like the number of people whom we believe are still in the United Kingdom, that others have simply decided to remain without making a formal application to the Home Office. What is the status of those people, and what action do the Government intend to take? I read reports recently that suggested that the Government intended to proceed with a programme of, if necessary, forcible repatriation of people who were evacuated here under the UNHCR programme, and who were no longer entitled to remain. Is that their policy? If so, on what time scale do they plan to implement it?<br><br>
What advice are the Government receiving from the UNHCR about the advisability of returning people? When we debated the subject in January, during a harsh winter, with snow on the ground, and with the rebuilding of homes in Kosovo still at an early stage, the UNHCR strongly advised against sending people back unless they were willing and prepared to make the journey. We are now half a year further on. What assessment have the Government made of conditions in Kosovo and the appropriateness of returning people
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
there, if necessary against their will? As the Minister will know, other European countries have forcibly sent people back to Kosovo. Has the Minister made an assessment different from that of her counterparts in other countries?<br><br>
Two minor points remain to be dealt with. The first concerns the period for which the grant is payable. As I understand the special report, the grant is payable in respect of listed categories of expenditure incurred by local authorities at any time in the current financial year, with one exception. The exception is that local authorities will qualify for reimbursement of the closure costs of reception centres only in respect of expenses incurred between 1 April and 25 July. Has that short period been specified because the Government believe that every local authority will close its reception centre within those dates? Alternatively, is there a risk of our approving a measure that will leave some local authorities unable to be reimbursed for costs associated with the disposal of reception centres because they missed the 25 July deadline by a matter of days or weeks?<br><br>
Finally, on the people for whom local authorities are eligible for reimbursement, annex A to the special grant report refers to qualifying individuals as people who came here as part of the humanitarian or medical evacuation programmes and who are within the 12-month period of exceptional leave to remain that was granted on arrival. With the exception of a few medical evacuees, those people arrived between late April and late June 1999. Therefore, virtually all the Kosovan people whom we are discussing have gone beyond that 12-month period. Given that a significant number of Kosovans remain here, what is the position of local authorities that support those people? If they have tried to extend exceptional leave to remain or claimed asylum, do they move into the normal support systems that are in place for other people in those categories?<br><br>
What happens to people who have decided to stay on without making a formal application to remain and who are here contrary to immigration law? Does a local authority have a continuing responsibility to provide support as set out in the National Assistance Act 1948 and the Children Act 1989, with which we are familiar in the context of asylum legislation? It may be that local authorities will say, "We are being expected to provide support to Kosovan families who have remained here despite the expiry of their 12-month exceptional leave to remain, but the Government are refusing to reimburse us by way of special grant. What are we supposed to do?" I hope that the Minister will write to Committee members if she cannot respond to those issues today.</span></p>
<p>4.48 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am happy to serve under you, Dr. Kumar. I had naively assumed that you were a true native of the north-east. I never imagined you were tainted or embellished by a previous London pedigree. Committees are always a revelation.<br><br>

Like the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington), I have specific questions on the detail of the report. It is in general welcome, and my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) and I will support it. I want to declare two relevant, but not registrable, interests. First, the Minister knows that I have just been to Kosovo with the Refugee Council. I was accompanied by the right hon. Member for Fareham (Sir P. Lloyd) on behalf of the Conservative party and the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) who chairs the all-party refugee group on behalf of the Labour party. Secondly, I have a large number of Kosovans in my constituency, although they are not from the programme. About 750 live less than a mile from here at Elephant and Castle.<br><br>
Although I want to associate myself with questions asked by the hon. Member for Aylesbury, I do not intend to repeat or elaborate on them. Let me deal with specifics. Is there provision in annex A to cover the costs of staff who are not directly working on the projects that deal with refugees who came out as medical evacuees or as part of the programme, but who have been brought in because of their particular expertise, perhaps in languages? It is not clear to the Local Government Association whether that is covered. Is there a logical reason—minds much better than mine might have thought about this—for separating people who arrived independently and came within the funding regime from those who were evacuated last year as part of the programme in which the Government participated. I ask because one person and a family of four would impose similar costs on the local authority. Logically, the grant allocation formula should be the same irrespective of the way in which those people came here.<br><br>
I have been alerted to a problem in the timetabling of grant applications and payments. Local authorities have to submit bids soon after the beginning of the year. Yellow forms have to be submitted by the end of June—the formal deadline is 30 September—and payments will made by the end of September. It has been put to me that it would be better for the local authorities most affected, such as Leeds and Liverpool, if the deadline were earlier in the financial year. Rather than having to wait until September, local councils would be certain of the financial position much sooner.<br><br>
More relevant to local authorities is how long they have to wait for their money. Councils are willing to assist, but they need the money as the costs arise. It would be unfair if they were given the money significantly in arrears, as it might cause financial difficulties. As I read the order, the money may not be paid until nine or 12 months after the costs are incurred.<br><br>
One of the most severe complaints by local authorities about the asylum and refugee issue is not concerned with their responsibilities—they are happy about those—but with the fact that they are not adequately reimbursed. Either they put in a bid for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
more than they are entitled to, or they receive it belatedly; in both cases, they are financially disadvantaged. The more generous they are, the more financially prejudiced they will be. The Minister and others who have experience of local government will know about the costs to authorities such as ours in London, and will not want them to be financially disadvantaged.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury mentioned medical refugees. The Minister will know the figures better than I do, but I believe that those who arrived under the original emergency programme last year are going back this year. They would normally have exceptional leave to remain for a year, but, as the hon. Gentleman said, that would take them over the financial period for which the grant settlement is allocated. The question is whether the money is guaranteed to the local authorities. If they took the medical evacuees who arrived in June 2000, who were given leave to remain for one year, they will want to be certain that they will receive the grant for at least the period of the exceptional leave to remain. Otherwise, as the end of the financial year draws near, there is a risk of financial prejudice and uncertainty.<br><br>
The view of the Local Government Association—it is not a subjective view—is that many of the medical evacuees are being supported by Refugee Action and other charities because the local authorities do not yet have the money to pay for their stay here. The worry is that they will not have the money later in the cycle. It would help if they knew that the money would be guaranteed for as long as someone had permission to be here, and that the councils could plan for it.<br><br>
I believe that the hon. Gentleman and I were also thinking in parallel on another specific point. We shared a concern about what seems to be a trap, loophole or unanswered question. People who are here entirely lawfully and have entered the country as medical evacuees under the programme can apply for a continuation of their stay, although they will obviously have to do so in due time. However, such people cease to have support entitlement during the time for which their perfectly proper applications are being considered. Local authorities would be reassured to be told that the grant would be recompensed and that reimbursement would be given in respect of the time during which lawful applications to stay beyond a year, whether in the short or longer term, were considered, or, indeed, during which relevant appeals were heard.<br><br>
My final two general points relate to slightly wider issues but follow on from my other comments. The Minister and the Home Secretary were kind enough to see me and my two parliamentary colleagues on the Refugee Council about issues relating to the position of the British Government vis-à-vis their international obligations and the view of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. When we were in Kosovo at the end of May, we formed a unanimous, cross-party view on some aspects of the programme. We recognised the huge welcome that it had received both in Kosovo and here, and its positive results at both ends. Of course, Britain was not the biggest player and,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0084">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
as the hon. Member for Aylesbury hinted, Germany took many more people under the programme. Switzerland, which is outside the European Union, also took a large number.<br><br>
We agreed, however, that there was a potentially serious disadvantage for some people, because it had been assumed that Kosovo would be ready and able to accept everybody back at the end of the year, not least because it was thought that it would be easier to go home in summer than in winter. We received strong advice from every agency—the UNHCR in Kosovo, the civic authorities in waiting, other agencies and British charities—that there was no certainty that that would be possible for most people.<br><br>
We were told that many people would need more time for one of three reasons. First, some would have no homes to go to because their own habitations had been destroyed and they could not put them back into use. Secondly, many people's jobs were no longer in existence. We gave the Minister an example of that, in the form of an honourable family consisting of parents in their early 50s with two young children. The father had worked in a bakery. The family went back and spent all their remaining money on putting their home in order, but the job had gone. No job meant no income. There is, obviously, no welfare state in Kosovo, and charges are now being imposed for education and health. Furthermore, no family member abroad was able to send remittances back to keep the family going. It would be sad if we spoiled the reputation of the humanitarian exercise by sending people back to their homes when they are going back to nothing.<br><br>
There was a third strong reason why people might not be able to return. The right hon. Member for Fareham, the Minister's former colleague and also her predecessor at the Home Office, took the view that there might be some benefit, not least in cost terms, to the UK and Kosovan people in allowing refugees to stay a little longer to enable them to develop a few more skills that might make them more employable at home. Such skills could be speaking English, which they are all keen to learn to do, computer skills, business management, book-keeping and so on.<br><br>
In the context of the grant funds that will be allocated for the programme this year, will the Minister tell the Committee whether the Government have undertaken considered reflection on the suggestions made by the group that went to see her colleague and herself? Have the Government finished their discussions with German, Swiss and other authorities? Obviously, the effort must be collective. If they have not reached a view, do they expect to do so before Parliament is suspended for the summer recess? People will be reassured if they can see that there is no absolute and cold cut-off point and that flexibility is allowed when it is appropriate, so that the going home, which most of the people in question want to do, is a gradual process that allows a consolidated, safe Kosovo and not a Kosovo that cannot take the pressure of people going back as quickly as we helped to take people out when the crisis occurred.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<p>4.59 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to respond to the points raised. On the first point raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) about medical evacuees, the hon. Gentleman was right, given that that decision was dependent on what medical facilities were available. Some medical evacuees arrived some time after those who came with the HEP programme. It is certainly correct that some medical evacuees and their immediate families are still within the period of initial leave to enter granted to them.<br><br>
To pick up another point made by the hon. Gentleman and, I think, by the hon. Member for Aylesbury, the report does cover those evacuees and will do so until 31 March 2001. In that sense, the special grant report contains some assurance for local authorities.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury also asked about the figures. Some 54 per cent. have returned, and, of the remainder, 455 principal applicants have sought asylum. As principal applicants, they have dependents—about 1,392 individuals have sought asylum and 337 principal applicants, representing 905 individuals, have sought further exceptional leave to remain. As far as we are aware, everyone is accounted for, because, by making an application for asylum or making a further application for leave to remain, applicants identify themselves.<br><br>
Applicants are legally entitled to remain in the UK until they receive a decision on their application. Of course, those who made applications before their leave expired and whose applications are refused will have a right of appeal against that decision, as will all those who are refused asylum. There is a legal entitlement to remain in the UK to await the outcome of an appeal, and that process determines an applicant's status.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if the Minister is coming to this point, but in relation to the category of people to whom she has just referred and the process of entitlement to stay, will she tell the Committee whether the funding is also assured, and whether local authorities will know that in advance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Aylesbury and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey also referred to the situation regarding return. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey mentioned what the Swiss and German Governments have done. I spent yesterday with the UNHCR in Geneva and found general appreciation for the position taken by the UK Government, not only for what we have provided under the HEP programme, but for the support that we have given to people seeking refuge and support in the region. The UNHCR very much appreciated the tremendous contribution that we were able to make.<br><br>

When we last debated the conditions for return, Pristina was under 30 cm of snow—almost unimaginable conditions. From the start, we made it clear that the protection programme was temporary, and it was warmly accepted by the British public. In order for such a clearly successful programme to take place, the issue of return was important, and that opportunity arose.<br><br>
The programme was, of course, about protection. We pointed out to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and his colleagues that it was important that KFOR was in place and that the safety concerns that had led to the HEP programme no longer existed. I will comment further about that as I proceed.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury asked about reception centres and the cut-off date. Our information is that all the reception centres have now closed, and I hope that that reassures him.<br><br>
Among the other issues raised, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asked what information we had received regarding conditions. The United Nations mission in Kosovo—UNMIK—plans to build more than 20,000 houses this year, and the hon. Gentleman will already know much about that. The European Union task force and bilateral donors have already repaired more than 5,000 houses. The UK share of the overall EU programme in Kosovo this year is £30 million. I accept completely that much remains to be done. UNMIK has asked countries hosting evacuees to liaise closely with it on arrangements and the timing of returns, and I assure the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that we are doing exactly that.<br><br>
Questions were asked about support arrangements. Such arrangements can be complex because they depend on when people apply and on their entitlement. Evacuees will continue to qualify for support, if they made an application for further exceptional leave before their original leave expired, until 21 days after the decision to refuse their application. They are also eligible to work until an appeal has been dealt with. If they are granted further leave to remain, they will be eligible for support during that extended period of leave.<br><br>
Local authorities will have neither a power nor a duty to continue to provide support to those without children. When families have children under the age of 18 and are in particular need, local authorities might have obligations under the Children Act 1989 until the families can be removed. Support may also be provided to adults in particular need, for example on medical grounds, under the National Assistance Act 1948. That will depend on when people apply and on the state of their applications.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always conscious in debates such as this that the Minister's next point might have been the answer to my question, so I apologise in advance if it is. People whose exceptional leave to remain has expired might not qualify for exceptional help because of their medical condition or their children. They could
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
lawfully put in an appeal, and there might be a window of weeks or months. What do the Government say those people should do about financial support and their ability to stay here pending appeal?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That issue is complex because the situation would depend on the case—when they applied, whether they have children and whether there was a possibility of support under the Children Act or the National Assistance Act. It is difficult to tell from case to case but, of course, we will be able to give information. The report makes it clear when the obligations of local authorities cease and where applications lie.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to offer practical cases. People may go to Leeds or Liverpool and be granted exceptional leave to remain. The local authority is happy. The grant comes in, and is perhaps extended. When it comes to an end—assuming that no children and no other types of national assistance provision are involved—they have no entitlement to further funding, although they would be entitled to be here. A Leeds council officer might then ask the simple question, "What do I say to them about where they should look for support pending the outcome of their proper, lawful application for an appeal?"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Roche</span><span class='membercontribution'>: People given exceptional leave to remain would at that stage be entitled to social security benefits. If they put in an application within the correct period for further leave to remain, that support would continue. That would apply equally if they had made an asylum claim within that time. The obligation is not on the local authority—although a claim for housing benefit may well be made at some point. Such people will have had a valid leave to enter, and will have made a claim for its extension.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether interpretation services would be covered. We believe that they would be covered by paragraph 3j at annex A. We have also provided funding support for the voluntary sector, but that is outside the terms of the special grant report.<br><br>
I was asked what the Government intend to do, in general terms, about returns. Of course, we listen to what all the agencies say to us. The Home Secretary was grateful, as was I, for the meeting with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and others to discuss the issue. We are considering each case individually. All asylum claims will be considered in the normal way. If the claim is not well founded, an appellate process can take place. Claims for exceptional leave to remain will be made in that way.<br><br>
We hope that people recognise that this was a special programme to give temporary protection. There is a window of opportunity to return. We are still running another programme for people who wish to return. The Government judge this to be the appropriate time for people to return, having enjoyed what we hope was

a period of temporary protection. Now that the process has come to an end, we expect people to return in order to rebuild their country.<br><br>
I commend the special grant report to the Committee.</span></p>
