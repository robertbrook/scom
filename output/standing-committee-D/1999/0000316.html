<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Beverley Hughes)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Water Undertakers (Rateable Values) (England) Order 2000.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Railways (Rateable Values) (England) Order 2000, the draft Non-Domestic Rating (Chargeable Amounts) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2000, the draft Gas Industry (Rateable Values) (England) Order 2000, the draft Energy from Waste Plants (Rateable Values) (England) Order 2000, the draft Docks and Harbours (Rateable Values) (England) 2000 and the draft Electricity Supply Industry (Rateable Values) Order 2000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are considering orders that will determine the rateable values of most of the former public utilities, and regulations making some technical amendments to the transitional relief scheme for ratepayers generally. The orders will apply for the life of the 2000 rating list.<br><br>
The rateable value orders cover the following industries: the electricity industry, including large energy from waste plants; the water supply industry; BG Transco, which runs the gas pipeline network; Railtrack and London Underground and large docks and harbours.<br><br>
Hon. Members will be aware that only a few of the 1.6 million rating assessments in England need to be considered in this way by the House. Most properties
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
are assessed for rates independently by the Valuation Office Agency. Their rateable values broadly represent the annual market rent of the properties. However, such assessments depend on the existence of a market for the type of property concerned, or at least on the existence of competition in the industry involved, in order for the value to be assessed.<br><br>
In the case of publicly owned utilities, it was difficult to estimate how much a tenant would pay in rent to occupy a railway, a water supply network or a power station. This is less of a problem following the privatisation of the public utilities, and the policy of the previous Government and this Government has been to end prescription—the prescribing of rateable values—and to move the industries concerned into conventional valuation as soon as possible.<br><br>
Originally, the Government intended to end prescription at the time of the current revaluation. However, we decided a year ago that, although great progress had been made with the valuations since the last revaluation in 1995, full conventional assessment of these industries would still produce too much uncertainty for them. So, although we have made considerable progress, the time is not yet right to end prescription. Therefore, we decided to continue the existing practice of prescribing by order the rateable value of the industries, while continuing to work towards ending prescribed assessment in the future, for the next valuation.<br><br>
Since the spring of last year the Department, assisted by the Valuation Office Agency, has been engaged in detailed discussions with the industries concerned regarding their rateable values, or formulae for reaching their rateable values. For the 2000 valuation, the Valuation Office Agency has made good estimates of the rateable value of these industries using conventional rating methods. That is a step towards leaving prescription, because of the application of conventional methods. The orders are the result of those discussions, our deliberations on them and subsequent consultation with the industries concerned. They will apply from 1 April.<br><br>
The starting point for the rateable values before the Committee has been the valuations performed by the utilities rating team of the Valuation Office Agency. The team has worked closely with the industries for several years, and they have considered the valuations together line by line. I can, therefore, assure hon. Members that all the concerns raised by the industries have been carefully considered by the utilities rating team and by officials in my Department. That is not to say that all the industries concerned are pleased with the outcome, but we had to make a decision on the best advice available. As far as possible a high level of consensus has been reached between the industry and the Valuation Office Agency.<br><br>
Hon. Members will see that the orders contain a mixture of actual rateable values and formulae for reaching rateable values. Recalculation factors are included for all the industries, with the exception of the gas industry, as a proxy for subsequent changes to the properties. Those factors are needed, because reflecting changes as and when they occur would require a large-scale valuation exercise and new orders
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0241">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
each year. I am sure that members of the Committee can see why we would not want to go down that route.<br><br>
The railways order sets the rateable values of Railtrack and London Underground at £156 million and £42 million respectively for 2000–01. Those figures represent decreases of 24 per cent. and 7 per cent. respectively. Thereafter, the values can simply be adjusted to reflect changes in the track length of the networks.<br><br>
The docks and harbours order prescribes a formula that will calculate rateable values for large ports by comparing the port's income with its expenditure. Broadly speaking, a port's rateable value will be 27.5 per cent. of the balance between its income and its expenditure. This formula will operate within a range, with caps at both ends, to ensure that the rateable value is no more than 13 per cent. and no less than 5 per cent. of the port's income.<br><br>
The exact figures for each port have not been calculated, but we estimate that the effect on the overall rateable value for large docks and harbours is neutral. As for water and electricity companies there will be winners and losers. Overall, there is a fairer distribution of the rates burden on the ports affected.<br><br>
The water undertakers order will prescribe rateable values for all water supply companies for 2000–01. Those are the values in the schedule to the order. The overall change to the water industry is an increase in rateable values of 10.3 per cent. For subsequent years, each rateable value may be adjusted broadly in line with changes to the amount of water being put into the supply by the company concerned.<br><br>
The gas industry order sets the rateable value of BT Transco, which runs the pipeline network, at £430 million for the life of the rating list. The percentage increase in value is 8.9 per cent. No adjustment is required, because we do not expect any significant changes to the pipeline network.<br><br>
The electricity supply industry order sets the rateable values for National Grid and the regional electricity companies for 2000–01. The increase in rateable value across all the regional electricity companies is 10.1 per cent. Those values can be found in the schedule and may be adjusted for subsequent years in line with changes to main transmission line or transformer capacity.<br><br>
Article 6 of the electricity supply industry order also sets the rateable value of power stations by a formula based on the plant's generating capacity. The different values of the different types of power station are intended to reflect the differences in rateable value that we would expect if the ratepayers were in conventional rating.<br><br>
Finally, the energy from waste order will prescribe by formula the rateable value of energy from waste plants with a generating capacity in excess of 25 MW. Only a few plants fall within the order. The majority have a smaller generating capacity than 25 MW and are already assessed for rates in the normal way by the Valuation Office Agency. We do not propose to change that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
The power stations, large energy from waste plants and the docks and harbours will all appear on local rating lists held by billing authorities. The other properties that I have mentioned will be shown on a central rating list held by the Department.<br><br>
Overall, the orders will prescribe more than £2 billion of rateable value, which represents about 6 per cent. of all rateable value in England. That is a slight reduction in the rateable value prescribed for the 1995 rating list, but within that general picture individual companies will experience increases and reductions.<br><br>
I stress that the changes will not feed directly into rate bills. In April, the rating multiplier will fall from 48.9p in the pound to 41.6p, so that in practice only properties with an increase of more than 17.5 per cent. in their rateable value will face an increase in their rates bill. Furthermore, the transitional relief scheme will apply to those ratepayers, as to others. Next year, through the transitional scheme, all the industries concerned will have their increases capped at 12.5 per cent. and reductions limited to 2.5 per cent., before allowing for inflation.<br><br>
I turn to the regulations on chargeable amounts, which amend the regulations on transitional relief that we debated in Committee on 8 December 1999. As I said during that debate, the transitional relief scheme has been widely welcomed by business. The regulations now need to be amended to bring them into line with subsequent developments. Those amendments are contained in the Non-Domestic Rating (Chargeable Amounts) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2000. The most important provision is to be found in regulation 8, which brings the transitional relief scheme into line with changes to the rules on the backdating of successful appeals by ratepayers against their rateable values. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and the Regions announced those changes on 2 February, following extensive consultation with interested bodies.<br><br>
Under the new rules, a successful appeal against a new rateable value will have effect from 1 April 2000 only if the appeal is made by 30 September 2000. Where an appeal is made after 30 September 2000 and before 31 March 2001, the alteration to the value in the rating list will not be backdated before 1 October 2000. Appeals made in subsequent financial years will not be backdated beyond the start of that year. Those new limits on the backdating of successful appeals form part of a wider package of administrative measures to try to improve the appeals system, including the publication of a programme for considering appeals.<br><br>
The changes on effective dates are intended to encourage appeals to be made early, which will in turn make it easier to devise a comprehensive programme for considering appeals. Details of the changes to the appeals system are covered in a leaflet that we have asked local authorities to send to all ratepayers with their new bills. Regulation 8 provides that where a change in rateable value is backdated to 1 October 2000 or later, any adjustment to the transitional relief applying to the rate bill will have effect from the same date. That will ensure that a ratepayer who is affected by the transitional scheme is in the same position as

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
one who is not. Both will secure any benefits of a reduction in their rateable value from the date of the alteration of the rating list, whether that is 1 April 2000 or later.</span></p>
<p>4.43 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Waterson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is reassuring to be under your tutelage this afternoon, Mr. Olner.<br><br>
I thank the Under-Secretary for her explanation of the orders. All but one of them take a hybrid approach between the conventional and the prescribed assessment. As I understand it, the conventional assessment is based on the rent that a hypothetical tenant would pay for the hereditament on an annual basis. It is common ground that the previous Government and the current Government tried to move from prescribed assessments so that all the former utilities would be dealt with by way of conventional assessment. I understand that organisations such as BT and some of the smaller docks and harbours had already moved towards conventional assessment at the time of the previous revaluation, but that prescribed assessment still applies to electricity generators, the National Grid Company, the regional electricity companies, Transco, Railtrack, London Underground, water companies and larger docks and harbours, as well as large energy-from-waste plants.<br><br>
I want to record the fact that being able to move to the more logical and easy-to-understand basis of assessment is one of the benefits of privatisation and that it will be possible to deal with the former utilities on the basis set out by the Minister. Why have those other industries yet to move to the conventional basis, and what is the projected time scale? The Minister said that good progress had been made and that is encouraging, but does she have any idea of the end date? What are the difficulties and details that are holding up the process? It is important to go into that in a little more detail.<br><br>
I want to be clear that there will be no significant knock-on effect for commercial ratepayers in these arrangements. At the moment, many of them are facing considerable worries over the latest revaluation and some significant increases across the board, bearing in mind the transitional arrangements that we debated only a short time ago. Having said all that, are there any specific knock-on effects from the changes on commercial ratepayers as a whole? I understood the Minister to say that, broadly speaking, there were not and that within different industries and different categories there would be variations, but that there was a zero sum result at the end of the day. I should be grateful for clarification because many commercial bodies will be concerned about that.<br><br>
The changes that have taken place because of the discussions between Valuation Office Agency officials and the prescribed industries over their proposed rateable values are significant. Again, I should be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about how much further the discussions must go so that all
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
the industries can become part of the conventional assessment system.<br><br>
The separate issue of the chargeable amounts order, as I understand it, is based, in part, on an error in the original regulations giving effect to the transitional rate relief. The error, as I understand it, lies in regulation 6, which provides for the calculation of the base liability for a property not in transition on 31 March under the 1995–2000 transitional relief As originally drafted, regulation 6 did not give full effect to the scheme as announced by Ministers. The amendment to regulation 6 provides that in calculating the base liability for a property for which the rateable value on 31 March 1999 was less than £10,000—less than £15,000 in Greater London—instead of using the multiplier of 48.9p, the sum of 48p should be used. I suspect that the practicable effect of the error has been diluted, if not entirely removed, by the fact that the Department wrote to all chief finance officers of English billing authorities on 11 January this year stating that there had, unfortunately, been an error in the regulations and setting out how they should have read and the intention to amend them. That is what brought us here today. Perhaps the Minister will tell us a little about how the error came about, whose fault it was and whether she is wholly satisfied that it has not caused any expenditure to anyone, except the inevitable cost, which is difficult to quantify, of responding to the letter from the Department and correcting calculations locally.<br><br>
The Minister mentioned the March 1999 consultation paper on appeals procedures issued by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. It proposed various changes to the business rates appeals procedures from 1 April this year. On 2 February, those changes were announced in the light of the consultation exercise. One of the changes, as I understand it, is that an appeal against the rateable value to 1 April should have an effective date of 1 April only if it is made by 30 September, and appeals made later will be backdated to 1 October. Will the Minister confirm that? Has she received representations from individual ratepayers or organisations? As I understand it, all ratepayers, whether they are affected by transition or not, will be affected in the same way by the appeals system changes. I assume that the Minister will want to confirm that that is the intention.<br><br>
You can tell from a glance, Mr. Olner, at the packed Benches behind me, that we are not considering the most controversial of issues. There was a patent error in the original regulations, of which I make no specific criticism, but I would like to know more about how that error arose. Opposition Members have no intention of voting against the orders, but I would like further clarification along the lines that I have requested.</span></p>
<p>4.51 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Adrian Sanders <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torbay)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a wonderful example of the complexity of Government. One would have to be a rocket scientist to understand the detail of the different valuation systems and formulas. One can argue that it is not necessary to know the detail—I do

not worry about how my car engine works as long as it gets me from A to B. Nevertheless, have the Government considered trying to simplify some of the mechanics and make them more easily understood by the public? Has the Minister considered taking the reforms further and reviewing the entire ratings system? Is it the best way of raising revenue that is understood by those who have to pay, and who therefore pay willingly?</span></p>
<p>4.53 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Beverley Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree with the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders). Committee members will recognise the complexity involved. It is important to maintain the integrity of the ratings system, but we cannot absolve the system of complexity, because the issues involved are inherently complex. We must ensure that each ratepayer is asked to pay a bill that is fair and, as far as is possible, transparent. The orders and regulations attempt to address those two competing objectives.<br><br>
The transitional relief scheme, which is the subject of the chargeable amount amendment regulations, will ensure that no ratepayer will face an increase in his bill, as a result of the 2000 revaluation, of more than 12.5 per cent. before inflation in the next financial year. Increases for smaller properties will be limited to 5 per cent.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne asked about the end date. We were working towards ending prescribed assessment for this revaluation. The nature of the exercise requires progress to be made step by step and in conjunction with the industries concerned. These are complex issues. A great deal of detail—for instance, about what is included in the valuation—must be considered. However, good progress has been made. We have moved from the formal way of prescribing the rates to the application of conventional assessment to produce the figures, even though the figures are still being prescribed. Therefore, we have taken the big first step and we are confident that the quality of the valuations will improve through further discussions with the industries, in time for the next revaluation.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne also asked what was holding up revaluation. Nothing problematic is holding it up. The delay in the nature and the difficulty of the task. In order to deal with it without creating uncertainty and instability in those industries, we decided that it was best not to rush into revaluation, but to take time to bring the industry alongside us and to achieve as much consensus as possible.<br><br>
I do not agree that this is inherently a benefit from privatisation; it is simply a logical extension. If one breaks up an industry and creates competition, one has a stronger basis on which to decide notional rental values. That is inherent in the different structure.<br><br>
We do not expect normal commercial properties to be affected by the orders; only operational property is prescribed. Any other properties that the industries have—such as shops or offices on a railway station associated with the operational activity—are assessed in the normal way, so the element of prescription is very limited. As I said, although the bills of individual

companies will go up or down, the overall effect across the country on the tax take is neutral.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne said that the transitional scheme was an error. It was an error in the sense that it was an omission. Regulation 3 addresses a problem in the structure of the original regulations, which we approved, that could have resulted in some small properties facing maximum increases in their bills of nearly 7 per cent. instead of the 5 per cent. that we intended. Therefore, regulation 3 would make that 5 per cent. ceiling on increases in the bills of small properties watertight.<br><br>
We believe, and I am sure that many hon. Members hope, that this will be the last time that the Government have to make prescribed rateable values by order. The assessment of these properties for rating is a task that, in an ideal world, should belong to the Valuation Office Agency and not to Ministers and hon. Members. Although that was not possible for this valuation, we shall take steps to address the problems that prevent conventional assessment from being used, so that these industries can be placed in the normal rating system at the next revaluation.</span></p>
