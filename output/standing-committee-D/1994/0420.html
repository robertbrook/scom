<p>Interpretation of Part I</p>
<p>1.—(1) In this Part of this Schedule—"the 1988 Act" means the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988;
<ul>
<li>"the Corporation Tax Acts" has the meaning given by section 831(1)(a) of the l988 Act;</li>
<li>"the Gains Act" means the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.</li></ul></p>
<p>(2) This Part of this Schedule shall be construed as one with the Corporation Tax Acts.</p>
<p><i>General</i></p>
<p>2. If a transfer scheme transfers property, rights and liabilities to a successor company, then, subject to paragraph 3 and paragraphs 15 to 19 below, the following provisions shall apply for the purposes of the Corporation Tax Acts in their application in respect of any accounting period beginning on or after the date on which the transfer scheme comes into force, namely—
<ol>
<li>any trade or part of a trade carried on by the Authority which is transferred in accordance with the transfer scheme to the successor company shall be treated as having been, at the time of its commencement and at all times since that time, a separate trade carried on by that company,</li>
<li>the trade or trades carried on by the successor company on and after the date on which the transfer scheme comes into force shall be treated as the same trade or trades as that which, by virtue of paragraph (a) above, is treated as carried on before that date,</li>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
<li>all property, rights and liabilities of the Authority which are transferred in accordance with the transfer scheme to the successor company shall be treated as having been, at the time when they became vested in the Authority and at all times since that time, property, rights and liabilities of that company, and</li>
<li>anything done by the Authority in relation to property, rights and liabilities which are transferred in accordance with the transfer scheme to the successor company shall be treated as having been done by the company.</li></ol></p>
<p><i>Chargeable gains: general</i></p>
<p>3. Paragraph 2 above shall not apply for the purposes of corporation tax on chargeable gains; and no provision included in a scheme by virtue of paragraph 5(2)(a) of Schedule 1 to this Act shall have effect for those purposes.</p>
<p>4.—(1) Section 171(1) of the Gains Act (which makes provision in relation to the disposal of assets from one member of a group of companies to another member of the group) shall not apply where the disposal in question is a disposal in accordance with a transfer scheme from the Authority to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Authority.</p>
<p>(2) In sub-paragraph (1) above "disposal" shall be construed in accordance with section 21(2) of the Gains Act (which relates to part disposals).</p>
<p><i>Chargeable gains: group transactions</i></p>
<p>5.—(1) For the purposes of section 179 of the Gains Act (company ceasing to be a member of a group), where any subsidiary of the Authority ("the degrouped company") ceases, by virtue of a qualifying transaction, to be a member of a group of companies including the Authority, the degrouped company shall not, by virtue of that transaction, be treated under that section as having sold, and immediately reacquired, any asset acquired from a company which was at the time of acquisition a member of that group.
<ol>
<li>Where, disregarding any preparatory transactions, a subsidiary of the Authority would be regarded for the purposes of section 179 of the Gains Act (and, accordingly, of this paragraph) as ceasing to be a member of a group of companies including the Authority by virtue of a qualifying transaction, it shall be regarded for those purposes as so doing by virtue of the qualifying transaction and not by virtue of any preparatory transactions.</li>
<li>In this paragraph—</li>
<ul>
<li>"preparatory transaction" means anything done under or by virtue of the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1954, the Atomic Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1981 or this Act for the purposes of initiating, advancing or facilitating the qualifying transaction in question;</li>
<li>"qualifying transaction" means—</li>
<ol>
<li>the transfer of any property, rights or liabilities of the Authority in accordance with a transfer scheme, or</li>
<li>the disposal by the Authority of any securities of a successor company.</li></ol></ul>
<li>Expressions used in this paragraph and in section 179 of the Gains Act have the same meaning in this paragraph as they have in that section.</li></ol></p>
<p><i>Chargeable gains: debts</i></p>
<p>6.—(1) Where—
<ol>
<li>any debt owed to the Authority is transferred to a successor company in accordance with a transfer scheme, and</li>
<li>the Authority would have been the original creditor in relation to that debt for the purposes of section 251 of the Gains Act (debts: general provisions),</li></ol>
the successor company shall be treated as the original creditor for those purposes.</p>
<p>(2) Where, in accordance with a transfer scheme, any obligations of the Authority under a guarantee of the repayment of a loan are transferred to a successor company, the successor company shall be treated for the purposes of section 253(4) of the Gains Act (relief for guarantors) as a person who gave the guarantee.</p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
<p><i>Securities issued in pursuance of Act</i></p>
<p>7.—(1) For the purposes of the Corporation Tax Acts, any securities of a company issued in pursuance of section 9 of, or paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 to, this Act shall be treated as having been issued for a new consideration equal—
<ol>
<li>in the case of a share, to its nominal value, and</li>
<li>in the case of a debenture, to the principal sum payable under the debenture.</li></ol></p>
<p>(2) The liability of a successor company under any debentures issued as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) above shall be treated for the purposes of the Corporation Tax Acts as having been incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade carried on by the company:</p>
<p><i>Group relief</i></p>
<p>8.—(1) None of the following, namely—
<ol>
<li>the existence of the powers of the Secretary of State or the Authority under the relevant provisions,</li>
<li>any direction given by the Secretary of State under any of the relevant provisions or section 3 of the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1954 so far as that direction relates to a restructuring transfer, or</li>
<li>any arrangements so far as relating to a restructuring transfer,</li></ol>
shall be regarded as constituting arrangements falling within subsection (1) or (2) of section 410 of the 1988 Act (arrangements for the transfer of a company to another group or consortium).
<ol>
<li>Neither the existence of the powers of the Secretary of State or the Authority under the relevant provisions nor a direction given as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(b) above shall be regarded as constituting option arrangements for the purposes of paragraph SB of Schedule 18 to the 1988 Act.</li>
<li>In this paragraph—</li>
<ul>
<li>"arrangements" has the meaning given by section 410(5) of the 1988 Act;</li>
<li>"the relevant provisions" means sections 1 to 6 and 9 of, and Schedules 1 and 2 to, this Act;</li>
<li>"a restructuring transfer" means—</li>
<ol>
<li>the transfer in accordance with a transfer scheme of property, rights and liabilities of the Authority to a company wholly owned by the Crown, or</li>
<li>the transfer by the Authority to the Secretary of State or the Treasury or his or their nominee of shares of a successor company.</li></ol></ul></ol></p>
<p><i>Leases</i></p>
<p>9.—(1) Section 35 of the 1988 Act (charge on lease granted at an undervalue) shall not apply in the case of any lease which, in accordance with a transfer scheme, is granted—
<ol>
<li>to a successor company, or</li>
<li>by a successor company to the Authority.</li></ol>
<ol>
<li>Section 87 of the 1988 Act (taxable premiums) shall not apply where there is an amount which would have become chargeable in relation to any land but for sub-paragraph (1) above; and, accordingly, references to any such amount shall not be included in references in that section to the amount chargeable.</li>
<li>In this paragraph "lease" has the same meaning as in Part II of the 1988 Act.</li></ol></p>
<p><i>Sale and lease back</i></p>
<p>10. Subsections (1) and (2) of section 779 of the 1988 Act (sale and lease back) shall not apply where the liability of the transferor (within the meaning of that section) or of the person associated with that transferor is as a result of—
<ol>
<li>the creation in favour of a successor company or the Authority in accordance with a transfer scheme of any interest or right,</li>
<li>any other transaction for which a transfer scheme transferring property, rights and liabilities to a successor company provides, or</li>
<li>the grant by a successor company ("the relevant company") to the Authority or to another successor company of any interest or right, at a time when the relevant company remains publicly owned, in a case where
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
the ability of the relevant company to grant that interest or right derives from the vesting in the company in accordance with a transfer scheme of an estate or interest in land.</li></ol></p>
<p><i>Leased assets</i></p>
<p>11.—(1) For the purposes of section 781 of the 1988 Act (assets leased to traders and others), where the interest of the lessor or the lessee under a lease, or any other interest in an asset, vests in a successor company or the Authority in accordance with a transfer scheme, the vesting shall be treated as being effected without any capital sum having been obtained in respect of that interest by the Authority or the successor company.
<ol>
<li>Section 782 of the 1988 Act (deduction of payment under leases: special cases) shall not apply to any payments made by a successor company or the Authority—</li>
<ol>
<li>under any lease granted to a successor company or the Authority for the purposes of the creation in accordance with a transfer scheme of any leasehold interest, including, where effect has been given without the grant of a lease to the creation of a leasehold interest in accordance with such a scheme, any lease to which effect is so given, or</li>
<li>under any lease—</li>
<ol>
<li>which is granted to or by a successor company at a time when it remains publicly owned, and</li>
<li>which is a lease of an asset which at any time before the creation of the lease was used by the Authority for the purposes of a trade carried on by the Authority and which was, when so used, owned by the Authority.</li></ol></ol>
<li>In this paragraph "lease" and "asset" have the meanings given by section 785 of the 1988 Act and references to a leasehold interest are references to any such interest as may subsist under a lease.</li></ol></p>
<p><i>Write-off of government investment</i></p>
<p>12.—(1) Subsection (1) of section 400 of the 1988 Act (write-off of government investment: restriction of tax losses) shall not have effect—
<ol>
<li>in relation to any extinguishment by order under section 9 of this Act of—</li>
<ol>
<li>any liabilities of the Authority, or</li>
<li>any liabilities of a successor company which fall within section 9(12)(b)(i) of this Act, or</li></ol>
<li>in relation to any extinguishment by order under that section of any liabilities of a successor company which fall within section 9(12)(b)(ii) of this Act, if and to the extent that those liabilities are replaced by securities issued by the company in accordance with a direction under section 9(5) of this Act.</li></ol></p>
<p>Subsection (6) of section 400 of the 1988 Act shall apply in relation to any extinguishment of any liabilities of a successor company by an order under section 9 of this Act as if the reference to the body in question were a reference to the company whose liabilities are extinguished.</p>
<p><i>Modifications of transfer scheme</i></p>
<p>13. Where the effect of any transfer scheme is modified in pursuance of any agreement which takes effect under paragraph 8(2) of Schedule 1 to this Act, the Corporation Tax Acts and this Part of this Schedule shall have effect as if—
<ol>
<li>the scheme originally made had been the scheme as modified, and</li>
<li>anything done by or in relation to the person who without the modification became entitled or subject in accordance with the scheme to any property, rights or liabilities had, so far as relating to the property, rights or liabilities to which another person becomes entitled or subject in consequence of the modification, been done by or in relation to that other person.</li></ol></p>

<ol>
<li>In exercising any power to make an order under this Part of this Schedule in relation to any asset vested in a successor company in accordance with a transfer scheme, the matters to which the Secretary of State shall have regard include such information as he considers appropriate as to the price which the asset would fetch or have fetched if sold on the open market on the date on which the transfer scheme comes into force.</li>

<ol>
<li>the Authority,</li>
<li>a company which is wholly owned by the Crown, and</li>
<li>a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Authority.</li></ol></p>
<p><i>Stamp duty</i></p>
<p>24.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2) below, an exempt transaction shall not give rise to any charge to stamp duty except in so far as the charge to duty is on an instrument under this Act which is neither a transfer scheme nor an instrument that has been certified to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue by the Secretary of State to have been made—

<ol>
<li>it is stamped with the duty to which it would, but for that sub-paragraph, be liable; or</li>
<li>it has, in accordance with section 12 of the Stamp Act 1891, been stamped with a particular stamp denoting that it is not chargeable with that duty or that it is duly stamped.</li></ol></ol></p>

<p>25. No agreement for the purposes of, or for purposes connected with giving effect to—
<ol>
<li>so much of any transfer scheme as relates to an exempt transaction, or</li>
<li>any exempt transaction to which effect is given by the modification of any transfer scheme,</li></ol>
shall give rise to a charge to stamp duty reserve tax.'.</p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We previously indicated that the Government would introduce a new clause relating to the tax requirements of the Bill. The new clause is the fruit of our considerations and it introduces the new schedule. Together they deal with certain taxation consequences arising from the exercise of powers set out in the Bill, and in particular the consequences of transferring property, rights and liabilities to a successor company or companies.<br><br>
The provisions are technical and unavoidably detailed, but the broad aim, as with similar provisions in previous privatisation legislation, is to achieve "tax neutrality". Let me help the Committee by explaining what that means. Tax neutrality is about ensuring that the process of transferring AEA Technology from the public to the private sector does not, in itself, give rise to tax consequences.<br><br>
The Bill envisages the transfer of certain property, rights and liabilities from one entity—the Authority—to another—the successor company—for no consideration. In normal circumstances, such a transfer would give rise to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
certain tax consequences. For example, a charge to capital gains tax might arise on the sale of shares in a successor company in respect of the transfer of assets to the successor company by the authority. Corporation tax consequences might arise from the cessation of one set of trading activities by the authority, and the commencement of trading by the successor companies. Stamp duty, and stamp duty reserve tax, would have to be paid on instruments transferring property under or pursuant to a transfer scheme.<br><br>
Consistent with the principle of tax neutrality, the aim of the schedule, in broad terms, is to put the successor company in the same position for tax purposes as if it had always carried out the activities transferred to it from the authority. It is usual for such provisions to appear in privatisation legislation. However, as the Committee has discovered in its examination, the authority is not in quite the same position as many of the nationalised industries that have already been privatised.<br><br>
As a scientific research organisation, the authority is currently entitled to and does claim exemption from corporation tax. It is also exempt from taxation on chargeable gains and certain types of income under section 512 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and section 271(7) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. In practice, therefore, the authority currently enjoys exemption from corporation tax and capital gains tax.<br><br>
Because of that exemption, the general principle of continuity of tax treatment cannot be applied without some specific provisions to deal with this particular set of circumstances. Some key elements of the picture are missing, and must be provided for.<br><br>
I shall give the Committee an example of what the process involves by briefly outlining the provisions that relate to capital allowances. As yet, the authority does not have agreed values for assets that qualify for capital allowance purposes. Successor companies that inherit such assets would not be entitled to claim capital allowances in respect of them. The schedule provides a mechanism to determine such allowances, having regard to information concerning the market values for the assets concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ken Purchase <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wolverhampton, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that these matters are extremely detailed and difficult to understand. Would not it have been helpful therefore if the Minister had prepared some examples of the effect the measures will have on a new comany? Those considering purchasing AEA technology would then be aware of their potential taxation commitments and would know that such matters had been discussed at this level. Examples would be helpful: does the Minister have any to hand?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman wounds me because I have obviously failed to clarify the schedule's purpose, which is tax neutrality. The successor company will take over on a tax neutral basis and will not have to go through the anguish to which the hon. Gentleman rightly refers. The successor company will take over with a clean sheet. It will not have liabilities hanging over it, and uncalculated costs will not hit it. That is the purpose of the Bill.<br><br>
Another consequence that flows from the authority's status is that, because the authority has to date been exempt from corporation tax and has never made taxable profits, it has never had to prepare tax accounts. In-so-far as it might have had notional trading losses, those have never
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0503">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
been calculated. It is not the Government's intention to allow the successor companies to claim tax relief in respect of any such losses that might relate to activities transferred to them. There is no provision in the schedule for the successor companies to claim relief in respect of those notional losses.<br><br>
The provisions are in standard form, and are a necessary part of setting up successor companies as independent trading entities. I commend them to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments (a) to (d), which I have tabled, may seem a little odd because they single out particular paragraphs in an otherwise unremarkable schedule. As the Minister said, the schedule is a normal part of such a Bill—although that does not necessarily make it easier to understand. The Minister has, however, made the provisions a little more enlightening than they were previously.<br><br>
The amendments would wreck the tax provision and would, therefore, be unacceptable. The Opposition will obviously not press them to a vote, but they are intended to throw light on the process by which the Atomic Energy Authority will be divested of AEA Technology. The Opposition want the Government to explain how Government investment in the company—which has been heavy in past 10 years—will relate to the tax status of the new companies and how capital investment will be written off. The amendments also concern the vesting of past research, patents rights and know-how in successor companies and how the vesting of those relatively intangible assets relates to the tax status of such companies. In other words, it is about how to price years of research and people's endeavours over a long period. It also relates to the provisions that the Government will have to make for the new companies to be established.<br><br>
Before the House rose for the Easter break, I asked the President of the Board of Trade a question about pension liabilities falling to AEA Technology. In a reply yesterday, those were estimated at between £120 million and £160 million. That is a large sum of money, which the Government will have to transfer to successor companies. We should remember that those liabilities are not held but met out of current expenditure. However, they will not be met in that way when transferred to successor companies—they will have to be transferred en bloc. The total sum could be near to £200 million. The Government are expecting to make £200 million from the sale, so it seems pointless—to say the least—to write a cheque with one hand and to cash with the other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Purchase</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Neutrality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. Tax neutrality and income neutrality—that has a nice ring to it.<br><br>
The new clause also allows us to sum up our anxieties about the Bill and the potential fragmentation of AEA Technology, over which we have received no assurances from the Government. I shall return to that issue on Report, along with protection of employees' rights to employment and representation and their pension rights. We will also defend the strategic interests of the United Kingdom. Years of public investment in knowledge and research are going to be thrown away to the private sector, with no guarantee that an appropriate level of research activity will continue.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
I shall say no more, as I have outlined our worries and shall leave it at that.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause read a Second time, and added to the Bill.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment No. 65 agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Schedule 4 agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. The Committee is drawing to a close and I want to make two specific comments. The first will crave your indulgence, Mr. Hill, but underneath this rough and gnarled character is a delicate soul and plant. I did worry about the comment made by the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) about the terminally ill person who might be transferred to a new pension scheme and lose out through it. I am prepared to make special arrangements for a terminally ill patient who, backed up with a certificate, wants to stay within the existing AEA scheme.<br><br>
However, I must point out that the death-in-service provisions of the two schemes that have seceded to the private sector—the Amersham and the FSD—are for three and four years respectively, so a grieving widow could well complain to the hon. Gentleman that making that special provision has been to her detriment. I do not ask for a solution now. I merely request—in the immortal words of the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie)—that he writes to me.<br><br>
I thank you, Mr. Hill, for the kind and indulgent way in which you have led us through the proceedings. This is the first Committee that I have taken and you coaxed and guided me, and kept me off the rocks. For that, much appreciation.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Moonie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to associate myself with those last remarks and to thank you, Mr. Hill, for the tolerant and humorous way in which you chaired the Committee. It certainly helped us to complete our business effectively.<br><br>
With regard to the Minister's comments on the treatment of benefits, our concern has always been that any new scheme should be equivalent to the state scheme, and that the insurance conferred by being able to stay in should continue to be available. I shall examine his words closely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I also take part in this eulogy? It has been an exemplary Committee and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. We got through a lot of work—although there are still answers to be found in the future—in a good and friendly way, which is not always so in Committee.<br><br>
My final task is to thank the police, the <i>Hansard</i> reporters, the attendants and most of all, my Clerk, Mr. Silk, for all his valuable nudging. It is with sadness, therefore, that I put this final question.</span></p>
<p><i>Bill, as amended, to be reported.</i></p>
