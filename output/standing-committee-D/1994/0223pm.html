	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hilary Armstrong 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Durham, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome you, Mr. Hogg, to the Chair. I appreciate that it is Thursday and that, as you represent a far distant area of the country, you will want to deal with matters expeditiously. However, before we rose at 1 o'clock, I was explaining that I have some credentials for speaking on shipbuilding, as my maternal grandfather, and other members of my family, worked in the yards in Sunderland. I did not say how disappointed I am at the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milbum). He has extensive experience of that industry and was involved in trying to stop the shipyards in Sunderland being closed. One of his jobs just before he came to the House was to co-ordinate the campaign to save Sunderland's shipyards. He was unsuccessful in that endeavour, but I hope that we will be more successful tonight and that we will be able to do something to assist shipbuilding. However, even if the Government concede the changes that are being proposed, the welcome measures that they have already proposed will not alter significantly the problems faced by the British shipbuilding and manufacturing industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to increase our shipbuilding capacity. I know that Conservative Members are fed up with hearing about Swan Hunter, but last weekend I presented a retraining award to a man who had worked for that company. He was a highly skilled design worker—what was formerly called a draughtsman—who was having to move into other work. His skill was being lost, and many of his former colleagues already have gone to work abroad. There is a continuing need in the world for ships to be built. The signs are that there is about to be an upsurge in shipbuilding. This country will be ill equipped to meet new demand. The arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) are similar to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>472</span>
those that we will advance in support of our amendment. We must begin to redress the balance between companies in this country and those abroad. We must reassess the tax regime as it affects our companies' ability to carry over relief from selling one ship to buying another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By itself, however, that will not enable British shipyards to get back into the market. The Government must consider a number of other measures. We support the measures proposed by the Government, but we want to press them to give additional help. Our amendment suggests that three years may not be long enough; we have proposed five years. That is consistent with what we have proposed in previous years, although the hon. Member for Eastbourne is proposing seven years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Waterson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to tax the hon. Lady on one point. What is the logic behind her proposal of five years? She has probably seen the same graphs and figures as I have; indeed, she has probably seen more than she would ever want to see, just as I have. What reason on earth could she have, then, for plucking out the figure five—other than that it happens to be half way between seven and three?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke of a compromise this morning, and I have already said that the Opposition has previously argued for five years. We are concerned not to make a reasonable concession into an abuse. There could be a change this year, and other changes will be necessary if we are really to regenerate shipping, shipbuilding and the employment of British people in shipping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are testing the Government and seek change from them. Earlier this week, it was clear that the Government would not concede seven years; however, they might think a little more favourably about five. Five years would be better than three—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Four.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be better than four, as the hon. Gentleman says. However, we are not looking radically enough at the means of tackling the extraordinarily serious problem before us. I want to push the Government on this issue and find out how far they are prepared to move and to change the shabby attitude they have shown towards shipping during the past decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister grunts. However, we can hardly call it anything other than shabby if we consider the facts and the history of shipping. I do not want to wander too far into the clause stand part debate, but that history is shocking. Previously, this nation could construct, maintain and repair ships to a quality that was second to none; now, however, our capacity to do that has diminished almost to the point where there is little competition between yards in Britain. We could, however, effectively compete with other European nations and in the wider market—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady mentions the wider market. I am concerned about the wider debate into which she seems to be wandering. I hope she will return to the amendment, which leaves out "three" and inserts "seven".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0772">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>473</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that I was beginning to push your tolerance, Mr. Hogg, and I am sorry about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All our information demonstrates that there must be flexibility in this branch of shipping investment. We have to encourage a regime that allows flexibility in terms of how and when investment decisions are made and which supports them through taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Eastbourne moved the amendment, he went through individual cases. Although I have those same arguments in front of me, I do not want to read them out just to demonstrate that I have them, too. Investment flexibility is needed, and five years at least is necessary to achieve that. Owners of ships would certainly be able to benefit from purchasing at times when the market offers the best opportunities. It is now extremely difficult for British shipping to compete in that area because, apart from employment costs, other countries in Europe provide a far more generous taxation regime. We must take that into account. The United Kingdom loses so much trade because our shipping companies are not able to order, and have not been ordering, ships in this country. We must take steps to redress the current balance. I welcome the concession that has been made, but I urge the Minister to consider going a step further so that we can begin to move more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise as the Member of Parliament for a constituency with a great interest in shipping; ever since I have been in the House, I have taken a close interest in shipping and have supported shipping amendments, almost from wherever they come in the House. I was also once employed as an accountant for an outside firm to do the audit of a great British shipping company. I feel strongly that shipping is important to the national interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intend to make a brief speech because my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson), in what I believe was his virgin speech—his maiden speech—on a shipping amendment in the Finance Bill Committee, covered all the necessary issues and got the message across that we need to consider further ways of supporting British shipping and encouraging investment in it. In consequence, I merely say that I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also have a direct constituency interest in shipping. That may sound surprising, as Dudley, West is about as far as one can get from the sea in the United Kingdom. However, in my part of the west midlands we make anchor chains, anchors, many of the washers and much of the equipment that goes to make ships. Thus, I have a strong and direct interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned at the current state of the shipbuilding industry and its decline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall stop the hon. Gentleman there. He is a new Member of Parliament, but he must address his remarks to the amendment. For example, if he can demonstrate that the chains, washers and anchors are all related to "'three' and insert 'seven'", his speech will be in order. Otherwise, it will not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>474</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. I merely wanted to make the point that I have a constituency interest in the matter. The importance of the supply chain to the shipbuilding industry should not be neglected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would support measures to increase the period during which capital allowances can be granted to the shipbuilding industry. I do not feel technically qualified to judge between five or seven years, but I think that an improvement in the legislation is needed. I support the amendments of my hon. Friends and that of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to declare a small direct interest as the sponsored Member of Parliament of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation for which, of course, I receive no direct remuneration. The hearts of oak that were once the symbol of our shipping industry are now replaced by welders of steel. The steel industry is of direct importance; I want to encourage it and I also want to encourage the British shipbuilding industry. The amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West is exactly the way to go about that. We must look specifically at the advantages that other countries give their shipbuilding industries and which we do not have here. The amendment directly addresses that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall cite two authorities on this subject. First, the Chancellor of the Exchequer who said on 21 April 1994 that
	<br><q><p>"it is common for shipping companies overseas to benefit from tax provisions"</p></q>
and that
	<br><q><p>"competitively, tax measures available overseas put our shippers at a particular disadvantage."</p></q>
That is what we are debating. The Government propose three years, my hon. Friend's amendment proposes five years and the hon. Member for Eastbourne has proposed seven years. So there is a clear divide between this side of the Committee, a pro-shipping Conservative Member and the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second authority on the issue is a senior Treasury Minister: the Minister of State, Treasury, the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Nelson), who, in a fascinating interview in the business news section of 	<i>The Sunday Times,</i> that well-known record of honest reporting—if I may be permitted an aside, I have to say I find the business news section of 	<i>The Sunday Times</i> the one part of that paper which generally seeks accuracy and something close to the truth—said:
	<br><q><p>"I would like to get the Treasury to think even more in terms of manufacturing industry, to be the servant of industry …</p></q>
I hope that, like the hon. Member for Eastbourne, the Financial Secretary will vote for the five-year or possibly the seven-year amendment. The Minister went on to say that he had held a wide process of consultation on how to support shipping and other manufacturing industries and had received 200 ideas; 86 are already in play and he is sympathetic to 47. That presumably leaves the rest, being without interest, to the shredding machine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0773">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>475</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is very interesting—but I can tell the hon. Gentleman that I have only one idea and that is to keep him in order. He, too, is a new Member, but I have a ghastly feeling that he has been around for an awfully long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The rigour and impartiality of socialist chairmanship has always been noted around the world, not just in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying. I seek the Financial Secretary's support for the amendment because we may find that the idea contained in the amendment might be one of the 86 already in play. I very much look forward to his contribution to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need to encourage shipping is central; 90 per cent. of our trade travels by sea and one would have thought there was an obligation to play to that strength, as the amendment seeks to do. Yet, in line with the Government's policy of moving the UK down the league tables of shipping and manufacturing output, we find that the UK merchant fleet has sunk from 1,300 ships in 1979 to fewer than 300 today. To take an example of a country that has that kind of capital allowance depreciation, the Netherlands has 325 ships flying under the Dutch flag as opposed to a UK total of 211. The Netherlands has a further 458 ships flying under a flag of convenience. It is one example among our European partner competitors of a country where tax regimes are based almost entirely on roll-over relief. It is more generous than the three years proposed in the Bill. So a tiny nation, much smaller than Britain, has more ships sailing under its own flag.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Estimates suggest—and they are agreed by all the world's international shipping authorities—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Name them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, the International Maritime Organisation and the Shipbuilders and Shiprepairers Association. Estimates suggest that we are embarking on a 10-year boom in world trade and world shipping with up to 2,500 ships—10 times the United Kingdom's current fleet—being built every year up to the year 2005. I want Britain to gain its share of that growth segment. To achieve that, we need the roll-over tax relief proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West (Ms Armstrong) and by the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Five years or seven years—we shall see how the votes play out—but a Confederation of British Industry report on investment last year showed that two out of five firms are still using short two to three-year payback periods for their investment, looking for a 20 per cent. return. The Government's proposal is based on short-termism, which is, of course, the major problem in financing investment—especially in the manufacturing sector in this country. Amendment No. 248 would give a longer time horizon, advancing it to five years, and amendment No. 216 provides an alternative of seven years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most other countries—Norway, for example, which has 711 ships under its own flag and 1,151 under flags of convenience—are well ahead of us. Tiny Norway has twice the number of ships than the United Kingdom has.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>476</span>
If the Government would accept either of the amendments, they could put British shipbuilding back on its feet as a dynamic industry with a feal future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was astonished to discover—from material sent to me yesterday as I was preparing my speech on the amendments—details of donations made by the shipping industry to the Conservative party. Such donations have increased enormously—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not rush to defend donations to any political party, but the hon. Gentleman should confine his comments to the amendment. There will be a clause stand part debate, in which the hon. Gentleman might wish to make his point, but it is not appropriate now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall finish by urging members of the Committee to support the Opposition amendment and to give serious consideration to the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Eastbourne. I also urge all snipping companies to look to where their real interests lie when it comes to making future donations. Those interests certainly do not lie with the Conservative party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sir George Young)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All those who have spoken in our interesting debate have started by announcing their nautical pretensions. The hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) is sponsored by the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation. The hon. Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson) has anchor makers in his constituency. The hon. Member for Durham, North-West had a maternal grandfather who woked in the shipyards. My hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) has taken a close interest in shipbuilding and represents a seafaring port. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne had close professional connections with the industry before he came into the House. I cannot compete with those claims, but the first baronet was an admiral who sailed with Nelson and he would have been horrified had he thought that the sixth baronet would work for the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are not to have a clause stand part debate, perhaps I can deal briefly with the more general points that were made about shipping and shipbuilding before considering my hon. Friend's specific amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not want to be unduly difficult, but if hon. Members made points which I have ruled out of order, or if I have stopped them from expanding on those points, I do not think that it is appropriate for the Minister to respond to them now. It will be appropriate during the clause stand part debate which, I have every confidence, will be extremely brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I subscribe to that aspiration. If the debate is to be brief, one or two anchors will have to be raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss the speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne before lunch, and the amendment in particular. As has been made clear, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0774">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>477</span>
Chancellor announced last April that the roll-over relief proposed is for three years—that concession has been widely welcomed in the debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne argued for a longer period. Perhaps I can set out the counter-arguments to his suggestions and make the case for three years being the appropriate time scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole aim of the measure is to encourage reinvestment in the merchant fleet. The argument for the roll-over relief is simple. We accept that because of market conditions or delays in constructing a new ship, there can be a gap between the disposal of one ship and the purchase of another. Under the normal tax rules, a balancing charge can often arise on the sale of the old ship. The shipping industry argued, and we accepted, that that was a disincentive to reinvestment, which is why we introduced the roll-over relief. We chose three years because that gives adequate time for a replacement ship to be acquired. When we introduced the measure, three years seemed the right length of time and it still seems like the right length to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three-year period has some secondary advantages. It coincides with the roll-over period for capital gains tax to which some ships may be liable on sale. It also means that the measure can be accommodated within the normal six-year period for settling a taxpayer's affairs. Both of those are administrative conveniences rather than compelling arguments for not going beyond three years. However, three years is central to the purpose of the measure and the point is to encourage reinvestment in ships. The problem with the longer period, be it five years or seven years, is that the point of the measure is lost. With three years, the measure gives a reasonable incentive for the old ship to be replaced quickly. With seven years, that incentive is very much weakened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne about cycles in the price of ships. With a seven-year roll over, we would move from the aim of encouraging reinvestment to assisting trading in future ship price movements. All investment decisions have an element of crystal-ball gazing, of course, but three years seems to get the balance right between encouraging investment and delaying it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne made a plausible case with force and coherence, as one would expect from him, and I accept that the right period must be a matter of judgment, so if he wants to withdraw the amendment, I will consider further some of the points which have arisen during the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The deferral of a balancing charge is not intended to give rise to or increase the loss for tax purposes. It is necessary, therefore, to examine the tax result for the period when the balancing charge arises in isolation, ignoring losses from other periods. One source of losses from earlier periods—section 393 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988—was omitted in the drafting of clause 82.

Government amendment No. 211.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall say a word about the context. Clause 84 proposes to introduce two new sections, sections 33D and 33E, to the Capital Allowances Act 1990. The two new sections define the expenditure to which the deferral of the balancing charge arising on disposal of the old ship is attributed and what qualifies as a new ship. The clause defines the expenditure that may be used to frank a deferred balancing charge arising on disposal of the old ship. The expenditure must be incurred on a ship that comes within the single-ship rules and has not previously belonged to the buyer or anyone connected with him. At time of purchase, the ship must also be regarded as a qualifying ship that will continue to be so for the next three years or until it is sold to an unconnected third party, if earlier. The clause sets out what is to be regarded as a qualifying ship for the purposes of the new roll-over relief. Qualifying ships will be those of a sea-going kind, of 100 gross registered tonnes or more, that are registered on a register maintained under the law of the UK, a member state, another state within the European Economic Area or a colony. The kind of ship normally used for sporting or recreational purposes will not qualify, nor will oil rigs or gas installations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within that context, the two Government amendments relax slightly the conditions under which a ship can qualify as a new ship against which a deferred balancing charge may be set. The legislation as presently drafted would not allow a ship to qualify if it had at any time in the past belonged to the present purchaser or a person connected with him. The legislation was so drafted to prevent groups of companies from using ships in their existing fleets to frank deferred balancing charges instead of making new investment. The measure is, after all, intended to encourage investment in merchant shipping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the amendments we recognise the fact that ships have a long, useful life and it is not uncommon for them to be owned more than once during that life by the same person, or by connected persons. By preserving a rule that a ship must not have been owned by a connected person in the previous six years, the amendments would still ensure that existing fleets cannot be used to frank deferred balancing charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should repeat the interests in shipping matters that I mentioned when we debated the previous set of amendments. As my right hon. Friend has said, in the shipping world it is far from unknown for a company or member of a group of companies to repurchase a ship some years after having sold it. The original drafting forbade relief in such circumstances, but, subject to the safeguard of a ship being beyond the control of the previous owner for at least the requisite number of years, repurchase by a member of the same group should be permitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seem to accept the principle of what I am saying in their amendments, as the Minister has explained, but I think that the period of six years is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>480</span>
excessive. It will not encourage reinvestment in modern tonnage, which is relatively young and efficient. Amendment No. 226 proposes an alternative period of three years. With a six-year limit, with all due respect, my right hon. Friend is promoting anti-avoidance overkill. If a ship was owned before and has been out of the fleet for at least six years, it is probably at least 10 or 12 years old—well into what passes for middle age among ships. The three-year period of limitation would still give the taxpayer protection while allowing modem tonnage to come back into ownership. The pupose of the provisions is, after all, to encourage reinvestment. A shorter period—I have suggested three years, but I am open to persuasion—would mean that there were more modern vessels in the fleet. It would also enhance safety at sea—which is an important consideration in the light of the Donaldson report—and, almost as importantly, it would produce a more efficient and therefore more profitable fleet, better able to compete in world markets for the carrying of freight across the globe. I therefore urge my right hon. Friend to reconsider the proposal for a six-year period and perhaps think about reducing it to three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have already said, the legislation was so drafted to prevent groups of companies from using ships in their existing fleets to frank deferred balancing charges instead of making new investment. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne said earlier that ship prices fluctuate in seven-year cycles. Amendment No. 226 would allow a company to sell a ship at near its peak price in, say, the second year of that cycle, to obtain roll-over relief on the balancing charge arising and then, just short of seven years after the start of the cycle, reacquire the same vessel at a low price and use that disposal to frank any balancing charge arising in the mean time. The amendment would encourage speculation rather than investment. To guard against that, we recommend that a new ship should not have been owned by its purchaser or a connected person in the previous six years—a period which also coincides with the tax time limits. I therefore advise the Committee not to accept amendment No. 226, but to support the Government amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You may wonder, Mr. Hogg, why I, who represent a landlocked constituency which is adjacent to your own, should move the amendment. I recognise the importance of the amendments to the regulation of the fishing industry in England and Scotland. I do not have expertise about such matters—and I crave the indulgence of the Committee in that respect—but I have been greatly helped by my hon. Friends the Members for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) and for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman). Although they are not serving on the Committee, they have submitted amendments. They both have considerable knowledge of the fishing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 would limit the qualifying ships to those that are registered and maintained under United Kingdom or European Community law. Amendment No. 245 would enable ships such as fishing vessels weighing less than 100 tonnes to qualify for tax relief on capital allowance balancing charges on registered ships with a
	<br><q><p>"registered length of or in excess of 10 metres".</p></q>
I am grateful to the many organisations that have sought to lobby members of the Committee for their help. Grampian regional council, which covers an area in which 26 per cent. of the Scottish fishing industry is based, should have been able to approach hon. Members other than my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North for assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gordon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I pay deference to the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), who has honoured us with his presence today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am appalled that those hon. Members who represent constituencies that are directly affected by the clause have neither sought to serve on the Committee, nor sought to table amendments on the matter, as some of my hon. Friends have done. Perhaps that shows that single-issue parties become so obsessed with those single issues that they fail to take into account the nuts and bolts of legislation, which can affect their constituents dramatically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike the Financial Secretary, I cannot point to any admirals in my family history. However, despite the fact that my constituency is landlocked, the prototype of the first steel-built ship was built in my constituency. I can assure members of the Committee that it did not sink.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the only fishing that goes on in my constituency is of tadpoles, I approach the matter with trepidation. The Government's proposal is not one with which I take issue. Broadly, it is a good thing that a ship can be replaced within a period of three years—rather than within a particular financial year of decommissioning of that ship—without losing the tax advantages of capital allowance balancing charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I have serious reservations about the concept that is contained in the clause, because it is seriously flawed. I must crave your indulgence, Mr. Hogg, because I should like to go into some detail about how it is seriously flawed. It applies only to ships with a gross registered tonnage of, or in excess of, 100 tonnes. If you, Mr. Hogg, were the owner of a boat with a gross registered tonnage of, or in excess of, 100 tonnes, you would be ineligible for the capital allowance balancing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>482</span>
charges. However, I recognise that because your constituency, Mr. Hogg, is Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, it is extremely unlikely that you would own a fishing boat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 100-tonne limit is damaging because most of the UK fleet is below that tonnage. Indeed, 94 per cent. of the Scottish fishing fleet, and 96 per cent. of the UK fishing fleet would be ineligible for the allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is further complicated by the fact that there is no clear agreement on the method by which a UK ship's gross registered tonnage is measured. That lack of clarity stems from the Government's refusal to abide by a European Union Commission regulation. The disparity in methods of calculating the GRT of a boat can result in a similar tonnage being calculated for ships that vary substantially in length and can produce a great difference in tonnage for ships of the same length.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. Lady is looking for clarity, but amendment No. 245 could have the opposite effect. Although it would apply a registered length requirement rather than a tonnage requirement, it would introduce to all vessels, of whatever type, the concept of registered length which, under UK registration rules, applies only to fishing vessels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but if he will bear with me I shall go through the process of registration. There are different ways of measuring a boat's GRT. Pre-1988 vessels are registered under part I or part IV of the various merchant shipping Acts. Post-1988 vessels of more than 24 m in length can be registered under the international tonnage convention 1969. That is broadly the same as the registration for pre-1988 vessels under part I. Post-1988 vessels less than 24 m in length are registered under another part of the same regulations. I apologise for the fact that that is complicated, but that very complication is relevant to our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From 1986, the European Union insisted that all registrations should be according to the international tonnage convention 1969. The method of determining GRT is an enormous mess which has not been helped by the Government's attitude—in fact, they have made things worse. Under the 1986 regulation 2930, the European Commission issued a Council regulation that all commercial vessels should have their GRT determined by the international tonnage convention, known as the London convention 1969.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As that was a Council regulation for the Commission, Britain must have assented to the ruling or, for an unknown reason that perhaps the Financial Secretary can clarify, objected. Whatever happened, the UK is now in conflict with the rest of Europe over GRT measurement, which complicates the clause. The Government's refusal to accept the universal London convention has caused the current confusion with different tonnage systems. Our amendment would clarify the system generally and not merely protect the fishing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure of 100 tonnes was alighted on by the Treasury in an arbitrary manner. Why was it chosen? Nothing in current custom and practice, or in regulation, pertains to 100 GRT. No precedent exists for choosing that figure as the cut off. Regulations governing the merchant shipping fleet, to which the clause also applies, might have predisposed the Treasury towards the 100 GRT cut off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0777">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>483</span>
I shall give the Committee some figures that have led us to table the amendment. The number of registered UK vessels under 100 GRT at January 1994 was 10,687. The number of 100 GRT or more vessels was only 385. If I could wear my Scottish hat for a moment, the number of registered Scottish vessels under 100 GRT at December 1993 was 2,726; the number of 100 GRT or more vessels was only 169. In both sets of statistics, and indeed wherever tonnage figures are quoted, tonnage seems to be a mixture of two different measurements: full measurements, in part I of the various merchant shipping Acts, which assigns different gross and net tonnages, and simple measurements—part IV and part II—which give the same figure to both GRT and NRT. Assessment of the UK fishing fleet has shown that a full measurement is some 40 per cent. higher than the simple measurement for vessels of about 100 GRT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that any graph that plots the UK fishing fleet according to length in metres and by GRT shows concentrations of boats at 10 m, 12 m, 80 ft, 25 GRT and 50 GRT boundaries. That is because various regulations and requirements come into effect at or over those lengths and GRTs and, therefore, it is advantageous to own a boat below the regulatory level in order to avoid costs and training. That is why we have opted for the length requirement in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would seem that the Treasury's proposal has been drafted with the specific interests of the merchant shipping fleet in mind. They are, by and large, big businesses, such as P and O, of which the Conservative party has considerable knowledge and which has powerful lobbying influence. By contrast, the UK and Scottish fishing fleets are small beer with much less leverage in influencing Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal referred to by the Financial Secretary in the previous debate, in response to the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, is to remove the 100-tonne qualifying threshold for any vessels in respect of which a balancing charge arises as a result of loss or irreparable damage. In some ways, that is a helpful concession, but, viewed in the context of these clauses, it causes some concern to the organisations that know most about such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Fishermen's Federation has made clear its view that there is little difference between a vessel that has sustained irreparable damage and one that is in need of replacement on account of age. The SFF also points out that exemption from relief on balancing charges, together with the fact that there is no grant in aid from either the European Union or the UK Government, means that a substantial number of small business men will have to face a formidable investment commitment completely unaided, as they seek to contribute to the need to keep the UK fishing fleet modern and efficient. I understood that the Government had made a commitment to small business men, yet the clause introduces a measure that would have a negative effect on small businesses, which constitute 95 per cent. of the entire industrial sector of the UK economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some specific questions for the Treasury relating to its decision to make 100 GRT the cut-off point. Has that been introduced simply as a result of ignorance of the UK fishing fleet's composition? Has it been introduced as a result of merchant fleet lobbying and a failure to take the fishing fleet into account? Is it a Treasury-led initiative to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>484</span>
minimise tax forgone in subsidy to the fishing fleet? Or could it be—one can understand the human considerations involved, but that does not help the people for whom the fishing fleet provides a livelihood—that Ministers and civil servants simply want to avoid the headache of having to administer the relief applications, forms, tax credits and registrations of new boats among the majority of the UK fishing fleet which falls below the 100 GRT level?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Fishermen's Federation has drawn to my attention the fact that this Government policy actively militates against other Government proposals for the fishing industry. It states that, wherever possible, the Government have pushed the industry to assist in the agreed fleet reduction targets. The targets arise from the fact that there are too many boats and too few fish and, consequently, the industry faces multi-annual guidance programmes, which are applied in the European Union, as well as externally. Within the EU, those guidelines are interpreted to provide a target evolution for member fleets and that is a legal obligation under Community laws, which currently run from 1992 to 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's advice to the fishing industry on assisting reduction targets is that, wherever possible, capacity aggregation initiatives involving two or more vessels should be pursued as a means of enabling fishermen to acquire new or larger vessels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would have a significant impact on the fishing boat building industry, which is itself in trouble. Not too far from both our constituencies, Mr. Hogg, are located a number of companies involved in boat building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure would reduce the size of the fleet numerically, while incurring a penalty deduction from the new capacity. That would earn a credit against the targets agreed with the EU Commission. The provision of enhanced taxation incentives, such as a three-year rollover from balancing charges, would help rather than hinder Government targets. Therefore, a Government concession on the matter before us would assist them with other aspects of their policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will be delighted to hear, Mr. Hogg, that I am drawing near to my conclusion. Although this is not one of the more riveting parts of the legislation, it would have a considerable impact on communities that have already suffered greatly as a result of changes in European Union policy, and as a consequence of overfishing in certain areas. In supporting the amendment, the Government would not be making a major concession. It would have a dramatic impact on fishing communities throughout Scotland in particular and the United Kingdom in general; it would give a boost to an industry that is overwhelmingly staffed by small business men and women; and it would be a sign that the Government are prepared to take heed of representations that have been made to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that I can speak to amendment No. 245, which was tabled jointly by Labour Members and myself and was drafted by Grampian regional council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would affect the whole shipping industry, but Grampian regional council has a special interest because of the importance of the fishing industry
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>485</span>
to that region's economy. I want to explain to the Committee why the council is so concerned that the Government are pursuing a course other than one that would widen the benefit available to the fishing industry. I shall also describe the circumstances faced by the fishing industry at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Grampian region, the industry directly employs 4,500 fishermen. When employment in fish processing and boat building and repairs is added to that figure, total employment increases to 10,000. Of course, many more jobs are dependent on the industry in many ways. Seven hundred vessels—one third of the Scottish fleet—operate from ports in Grampian region. I am sure that my hon. Friends representing constituencies in the highlands and islands would want to point out that fishing, whilst not as big an industry in the highlands and islands as it is in Grampian, is more important to the local economy there. Those facts bear repeating because they underline the need for the Government to be mindful of the difficulties facing the fishing industry, and the need to ensure that those working in it can adjust to the changing circumstances that they face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although my constituency does not have a substantial fishing activity, you, Mr. Hogg, might appreciate more than other hon. Members the fact that having Mr. Bob Allan, the chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, as a constituent means that I am never in want of a brief on the state of the industry. I also have been approached on this issue by another constituent of mine, Mr. Jim Braid of Kidsons Impey, a firm of chartered accountants which has many clients in the fishing industry in the north-east of Scotland and which believes that the amendment would go a considerable way toward assisting them at a difficult time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If unamended, the provision will preclude 94.2 per cent. of the Scottish fleet and 96.5 per cent. of the United Kingdom fleet from any benefit. It shuts out the fishing industry entirely from the benefit. Was that the intention? Only large, company-owned trawlers are covered, which, if not undeserving, are the least in need of the relief. The amendment would allow almost half of the fishing fleet to qualify for roll-over relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is not simply that the fishing industry deserves a tax break. The arguments are more powerful. There seems to be no reason for the 100-tonne limit, whereas the the 10 m limit is an established cut-off point in the fishing industry. The Government have required all vessels of less than 10 m to have a licence and they have taken control of all vessels of more than 10 m in terms of the days on which they are allowed to go to sea and fish. It took a long time to obtain the concession, but they have finally acknowledged the need for a decomissioning policy to enable us to manage the reduction of the fleet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 10 m rule is an established, clear dividing line that is understood in the fishing industry and it is logical that it should be included in the provision. If there is a fault with the drafting of the amendment, I hope that the Government will acknowledge the principle of the argument and discuss further how it could be included. The argument has logic and consistency on its side.

The hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) commented on the lack of support that might have been expected from certain quarters. One disappointment in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>486</span>
fishing industry in the north-east is the lack of support that it has received from Conservative Members of Parliament. That might be understandable from newly-elected Conservative Members who are trying to climb the greasy pole and do not want to upset the Whips. They might be hesitant, but active enthusiasm to vote to keep their own fishermen in port and to stop them going out to catch fish is less than helpful in demonstrating the success of electing Conservative Members to Parliament when we had, I thought, had the wisdom in the previous Parliament to get rid of them all and to replace them with Members of Parliament who could be trusted to fight for local constituency interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about the interests of people in north-east Scotland. If the hon. Member for Eastbourne intends to support the amendment, his support will be welcome, but as he did not vote for his own amendment in the previous group, I wonder whether he will, in fact, support this one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is vital to industries with a definite geographical location. In the areas in which they operate, they are an important part—sometimes the pre-eminent part—of the local economy. For example, the small community of Gardenstown on the Moray coast estimates that 66 per cent. of its employed population is dependent on the fishing industry for work. The changes that the fishing industry is having to undergo are a threat to the survival of the entire community. It is not unreasonable in such circumstances to expect from the Government measures which show sensitivity and an acknowledgement that where help can be given it should be given. That is what I and other members of the Committee are asking the Government to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grampian regional council must be commended for its success in persuading the European Union and, ultimately, the British Government to accept the importance of fishing dependence as a criterion for the assessment of 5B status—north Grampian has qualified on that account—to enable the industry and the communities to adjust to the changes. Help along the lines suggested in the amendment would provide additional encouragement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made general comments about the changes facing the fishing industry. We are talking about an active reduction of the total fleet because of the reduction in the quota, and everyone has agreed, reluctantly, that if the scientific evidence says that we must take less fish out of the sea, the only way in which to ensure a viable industry is to reduce the numbers of those who are dependent on taking those fish. It is regrettable that the industry must become smaller, but all sides accept it. That managed reduction requires a great deal of careful handling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested to me that if the amendment were accepted, it could encourage that managed reduction. For example, it would enable several vessels to be grouped together in the roll-off to build one replacement vessel. That would help to achieve the Government's objective and make it easier for the industry to finance that achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry is having to consider new fishing grounds and new species of fish. In some cases that means adaptation of vessels or building new vessels to meet new needs as there can be a need for new vessels even in a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0779">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>487</span>
declining market. That is clearly difficult financially and I believe that the amendment would make a positive contribution towards achieving it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have also tabled an amendment, to which the hon. Member for Monklands, East has referred. The Minister must be well aware of the correspondence that he has had with my constituent, Mr. Bob Allan, on the matter. It is a welcome gesture that the Government are saying that in the event of a total loss they will allow a replacement vessel to qualify. I do not want to be churlish, but if the Government concede that principle they cannot say that it is not practical to extend it. One can only suppose that they do not want to run the risk of the cost to the Exchequer. I have not been able to ascertain what the cost might be—and it would of course depend on take-up—but I am not convinced that it would be a cost of any significance to the Government, even though it could be of considerable significance to the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Allan said in his reply to the Minister on 22 February, "My federation"—the Scottish Fishermen's Federation—
	<br><q><p>"is indeed most appreciative of this concession on the part of the Government, inasmuch that this will undoubtedly bring a measure of relief to the Fishing Industry in circumstances where a fishing vessel is lost and requires to be replaced, but it has to be said that there is not a great deal of difference between a vessel which is viewed as having sustained irreparable damage and one which is in need of replacement on account of age, with all the consequences of potential unseaworthiness that may arise from that."</p></q>
That point about seaworthiness is pertinent in the context of the tie-up rule, because there is real concern that fishermen may go to sea in dangerous circumstances in vessels that are not fit to sustain such treatment, in order to meet quotas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Allan continues:
	<br><q><p>"In these circumstances my Federation is still very much of the view that the needs of the Fishing Industry in this context can only be fairly and properly satisfied by the removal, without qualification, of the 100 ton qualifying threshold and I would therefore re-submit that position for your consideration, for all of the reasons set out in my letter of 10th November, 1994."</p></q>
The Minister can be in no doubt that the industry, in welcoming the small concession that has been made, is essentially reinforcing my point that, having made that concession, the Government have breached the dam. It would be appropriate for the Government to acknowledge that the needs of the industry and the case that has been made justify acceptance of the amendment or some variation on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the Government have strong evidence of a serious cost or other flaw, it seems that resistance will merely cause further damage and irritation to a battered and disillusioned industry which needs help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To end on a positive note, if the cost is not high—and I suspect that it is not—this may be an opportunity for the Government to rebuild a little of the confidence lost in the industry during recent difficulties over the common fisheries policy. The industry deserves help. The measure is practical and will benefit many remote and rural communities in Scotland which depend heavily on the industry and contribute substantially to the national economy through the catch that they bring home. I hope the Government will seriously consider the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that amendment No. 1 has a serious flaw. It would limit the roll-over balancing charges to the sale only of those vessels owned prior to 20 July 1994 which were on the UK or other European registers. That could emasculate the new provisions since only a quarter, roughly, of the UK-owned fleet is on those registers. It would limit their application to a small proportion of the existing British fleet, excluding even the Isle of man and the Hong Kong registers. It would leave untouched the "relevant register" provisions for ships acquired after 20 July 1994, which, apart from the UK, the European Union and European Economic Area registers, also includes other red ensign registers. It seems that that result was not intended by the hon. Members who tabled the amendment, which is a misconceived attempt to force owners to register only in the UK or the European Union. They have not thought through the effect of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Government amendments. Perhaps I can underline the difficulty in fixing the right period in cases in which a ship has been an actual or constructive total loss. There can be any number of reasons for delay between the ship being lost or becoming irreparable and the purchase of another vessel. There may be lengthy investigations by the insurers. Even when the claim is agreed there can be delays in collecting the insurance proceeds from Lloyd's or foreign underwriters. Owners may miss the tide by recovering only the insured value of a vessel. That value may have been fixed a long time prior to its loss. Therefore, the owners might miss not only the sale and purchase market, but the charter market. As I demonstrated earlier, both can change rapidly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to consider the relevant period in such cases. Otherwise, I welcome the Government amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I wish to speak to Government amendments Nos. 212, 213 and 214. I shall then deal with remarks made by the hon. Members for Monklands, East and for Gordon. The

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>489</span>
points raised are of great concern to Scottish fishermen, Grampian regional council and to those who look to the fishing industry for their livelihoods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 212 would make a concession that has been welcomed. As drafted, the Bill allows only those ships with a gross tonnage of 100 tonnes or more to qualify for the roll-over relief on balancing charges. The imposition of a balancing charge is most keenly felt when the vessel is unexpectedly lost. In those circumstances, a programme of planned replacement is not possible and a balancing charge may arise just when capital investment is needed to purchase a new vessel. A lost fishing vessel is a good example of such a case. The amendment allows the new roll-over relief measure to apply in cases where a vessel of whatever size is lost or irreparably damaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Financial Secretary help me? It has been proven that the Government's proposal will exclude 94 or 95 per cent. of the United Kingdom fishing fleet. Therefore, when dealing with amendment No. 212; will the Financial Secretary elaborate on the difference between a vessel that is not commercially worthwhile and has been taken out of operation because it has been damaged and one that is not commercially worthwhile because quota restrictions do not enable it to be so?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase "not commercially worthwhile" appears in amendment No. 212. How does the Financial Secretary distinguish between the words in the amendment and the arguments that have been used to support the case for making a concession available to the majority of United Kingdom fishermen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point is that posed by the hon. Member for Gordon. He asked about the distinction between a ship that cannot be used because it is damaged and one that cannot be used because it is—these are not the hon. Gentleman's words—clapped out. The answer is simple. Sadly, old age is predictable. Damage and loss at sea are not. That is why it is appropriate to have different regimes for the unpredictable, which is covered by amendment No. 212, and the predictable, which was the case referred to by the hon. Member for Gordon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that unpredictable changes are affecting the industry. They require the industry to adapt or to lay off ships. That involves costs for which relief is not available unlike when a ship is lost by sinking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting argument, but it is different from the one that the hon. Gentleman used when he spoke. I shall explain shortly why the measures in the clause are focused on the merchant fleet rather than the Scottish fishing fleet. As the hon. Gentleman recognised, amendment No. 212 was welcomed by the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, which has written to me in courteous and compelling terms over the past few months, as has Grampian regional council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendments Nos. 213 and 214 relate to the registration requirement to be met by vessels before they can qualify as new shipping against which a deferred balancing charge may be set. As drafted, the Bill allows a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>490</span>
ship to qualify only if, when first flagged to its current register, that register was maintained by the United Kingdom, a member state of the European Union, another state within the European Economic Area of a colony. A country can be included in that list at some time after a ship was first flagged to its register. The amendment would allow for that eventuality. It would allow ships to qualify if, at any time during the qualifying period for a vessel, the country to which they are flagged is in the list that I mentioned earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question at the heart of the debate is why the measures have been structured in a way that excludes the vessels mentioned by hon. Members. Roll-over relief of balancing charges is a measure aimed at stimulating investment in the merchant fleet. Targeting was required to ensure that the relief helps the required sector and 100 GRT covers the merchant fleet effectively. We chose gross registered tonnage as the qualifying threshold because gross registered tonnage is internationally recognised as a standard measure of shipping. Length is less frequently used as a measure of large ships, which are the target sector for this measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that amendment No. 245 would bring some categories of fishing vessels of less than 100 tonnes within the scope of the measure. However, the key point is that the vessels about which hon. Members have spoken can usually be replaced within one accounting period and thus the issue of balancing charges does not arise. If a ship is replaced within 12 months, the relief is not needed because the balancing charge simply does not arise. The exception is when a vessel is lost at sea and such vessels will be allowed to qualify for the relief by virtue of Government amendment No. 212. For those reasons, I cannot accept the Opposition amendments. The measure is specifically targeted—this was the subject of a debate a year ago—at the merchant marine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, East developed her argument and said that fishing vessels are as deserving a case as the merchant fleet. But the key distinction is that there is currently overcapacity in the United Kingdom fishing fleet. That is being tackled by a decommissioning scheme under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. A decommissioning scheme would sit rather uneasily against the kind of relief to which the amendment relates which would promote reinvestment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decommissioning scheme started in 1993 and will run until 1997. It has a total budget of £53 million, which is a substantial sum. Under that scheme, grants may be paid to owners who scrap a fishing vessel over 10 m in length when it has a current fishing licence and safety certificate. The fishing licence attaching to that vessel must also be surrendered. Generally, no new fishing licences are granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against the background of that strategic approach to deal—I hope humanely—with overcapacity, proposals to promote reinvestment sit rather uneasily. In any case, the fishing boats—the smaller boats—are usually replaced within one accounting period, not least because of the necessity to keep the trade going. As I said, in that instance, no balancing charge arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Malcolm Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may press the Minister on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By definition, the decommissioning scheme is about taking vessels out of commission. But does the Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0781">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>491</span>
accept that the industry has to adapt to changing circumstances, and that that requires investment? There is a need to reduce the fleet and also to change it. Therefore, it is churlish of the Government to say, in effect, that they will pay for the vessels that are taken out but not for the cost of modernising or replacing to meet changing needs. The industry is pressing that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is so, the industry should be able to respond in a strategic way by acquiring the new vessels within the 12-month accounting period of the old ones that were disposed of; if that is done, a balancing charge does not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have explained why we have structured the measure as we have. It is not due to oversight, ignorance or Treasury meanness: the purpose is to deal with a specific, strategic issue in the merchant fleet. We have separate, relevant policies to deal with the specific problem mentioned by hon. Members—that relating to Scottish fishermen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I hope that the Committee will support the Government amendments, which are not controversial—where they are, they have been welcomed—and will resist amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 245.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment means that no claim to rollover relief for balancing allowances on ships could be made until a time appointed by the Treasury.

There is a sorry history behind the relationships between the Treasury and the Commission on shipping issues. I seek assurance that the Government are not, yet again, getting into trouble which will lead to problems. The Financial Secretary is looking bemused. It was not possible to re-open yards in Sunderland because agreements were made which people did not know about. An agreement was made between the Chancellor and the Commission. I seek an assurance that in future such agreements will not be made in a manner that will disadvantage British shipping.

I ask the right hon. Gentleman why the process took so long.

I understand that the initial letter from the Treasury was not received until late October and that the Commission has written back, but that it is now awaiting the outcome of the proceedings on the Bill. It seems that we are getting into circular arguments and that there needs to be clearer and more organised debate and discussion between the Commission and the Treasury so that we know what will happen, know the view of the Commission on this particular form of aid for our shipping industry and know the precise manner in which the matter will proceed.

international treaties and giving notification when we need to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The short and reassuring answer for which the hon. Lady asked is that we have had no indication that the Commission is likely to refuse approval for the measure—which is, after all, a fairly modest state aid in comparison with some existing in other member states, a point that has been touched on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the time scale, the clauses were published in July, we wrote in October and the Commission asked some statistical questions in November. As I said a few moments ago, we have had no indication that it is likely to refuse approval for the measure which, by comparison with the assistance given to some other industries in Europe, is relatively modest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have just rushed through a significant proposal. Amendment No. 207 substantially changes the nature of the design, build and finance operations in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have long called for recognition of the need for a public sector relationship with the private sector for the provision of infrastructure for public use. Unless private sector firms are more confident in the regime in which they operate and its rules, and unless they feel that the public sector can offer the certainty to give them confidence, they will not invest. There have been many announcements in recent years that have not been followed by investment or where the promised investment has not been made, largely because of problems that the private sector has foreseen in the proposed infrastructure development. The position has not been clear enough for the private sector to make the necessary investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause relates to highway concessions on a particular form of road. To date, the trade describes it as a shadow toll road, although amendment No. 207 would undermine that because it would ensure that concessions would not rely on the use of a road. The Government are looking to other forms of funding and incentives through the taxation system, rather than counting the number of vehicles on the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition were concerned that the Government began to contemplate the subject of roads with such determination. We all know that a serious problem in this country is the level of congestion; building more roads is not the answer to that problem. It is estimated that traffic, at the current rate, will double by the year 2025. One of the more preposterous consequences of that statistic is that a 114-lane motorway between here and Edinburgh would be needed to contain such a level of traffic. I am sure that members of the Committee would not welcome that scenario. Therefore, we need a proper, integrated and strategic look at transport policy. I am concerned that the clause shows that the Government have, once again, run away from studying their transport policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>496</span>
It is absolutely beyond belief that the Government proposed a clause that would have taken the amount of traffic on the road as the key indicator of their support of the private sector. It would be ludicrous if the only way that the private sector could succeed was by increasing traffic on a particular road. I shall use the A1(M)—a road that I know well—as an example. If the developments on the M1 had been given to the private sector, there would have been competition between the A1(M) and the M1 over which road had more vehicles. We want to do the opposite: we want to reduce, as far as possible, the number of vehicles on roads and persuade people to use alternative forms of transport, preferably the railways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Really.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, really. We were concerned that road building and maintenance were introduced on the basis of the volume of traffic. There are problems because the Government do not have a strategic view on transport policy. Once again, they are lurching from initiative to initiative, with no overall pattern. They then have to study those initiatives again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government tabled amendments on the clause two or three days before we debated the clause, having recognised—I hope—that they got it wrong. It highlights the fact that they have not thought through their overall transport policy and that they have not linked their transport policy to their environment policy. Many debates over the past few years have shown that it is not possible to separate the two policies—they must be studied together. Yet again, the Government have failed to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition were to vote against the clause because it was leading us down the wrong road, but the amendments have improved the position. If the Government are to repair and support an infrastructure that will meet the country's transport, manufacturing and business needs, they must reconsider their overall thinking. Odd measures such as this will not solve the problems that we will all face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to say a few words about the clause. One of the criticisms made of the Bill is its limited scope in a number of respects. One sign of that was the letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer from seven organisations representing British industry. The letter was dated 7 October, although much of its content had been discussed with the Government prior to that. It calls for a number of measures in this part of the Bill. Headed
	<br><q><p>"A budget to boost investment",</p></q>
it calls for measures from the Government to end the cycles of boom and bust that we have so often seen and suffered from in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter, signed by the Confederation of British Industry, the Engineering Employers Federation, the Federation of the Electronics Industry, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and three other organisations, calls for four specific measures. One is that the Government should maintain spending on transport infrastructure. That is touched on very slightly in the clause, and I shall say more about that shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter called for two measures on capital allowances. The organisations want the Government to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0784">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>497</span>
	<br><q><p>"introduce first year 100 per cent. capital allowances for at least the first £200,000 of plant and machinery investment. This would particularly benefit smaller companies"</p></q>
and to
	<br><q><p>"include inflation indexation of existing capital allowances for plant and machinery".</p></q>
Those two specific proposals on capital allowances have met with complete silence. There has been no movement on those demands, not even a gesture towards any of the concerns expressed by the seven organisations, which represent the whole spread of British industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things that have surprised me during my few months in the House is how isolated the Government have become from British industry and how impervious they are to its pleas. There is not even so much as a gesture towards the pleas that the organisations have made to the Chancellor, many of which have been made over an extended period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides for an extension of capital allowances to encourage investment in infrastructure. That is an extension of a valuable and welcome principle which the Labour party has long advocated. However, it is disappointing that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West said, the clause deals only with road building. Yet right across the political spectrum there is recognition that we cannot go on building roads and consequently ramping up the volume of road traffic at the rate we have been doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, the Secretary of State for Transport made a speech on this very subject, saying:
	<br><q><p>"roads are crucial to our economic success, within an efficient complex of transport infrastructure on which our prosperity depends. But we need to look at whether our current actions and assumptions, superficially in the economic interest, are in practice in the economic interests of the country, of companies and of individuals, if a sufficiently long term view is taken. Our aim is sustainable development."</p></q>
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to find ways of substantially increasing investment in public transport, which should include attracting private investment to help fund it. We need a range of imaginative ways in which to attract private as well as public investment to fund our national infrastructure. We should follow the lead of the United States and consider ways in which we can encourage private investment in the information superhighways which will play a vital part in our infrastructure in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does nothing to tackle the key concerns of British industry, nothing to encourage private investment in public transport, nothing to deal with our emerging deficit in the information superhighway race. It simply encourages road building. That is part of a 1980s agenda, even for the Conservative party. Where is the Government's 1990s agenda? Does the Minister hold out any hope that the Government will tackle the areas of silence in the Bill and of deficiency in our taxation system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just before Christmas, the Secretary of State for Transport announced that the proposed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>498</span>
widening of the M40 between the M25 and High Wycombe would be tackled as a design, build, finance and operate contract. He said that he wanted to ascertain whether the relatively small stretch of motorway could be linked with one or two others. He has recently announced that the whole M40 between London and Birmingham will be subject to one DBFO contract. How will that work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I wrote to inform my constitutents about the new arrangement, one questioned the benefit to the Treasury. He could see that we would not incur much public expenditure, because the financing would be provided by the private sector. Later, there will be shadow tolls, which are the equivalent of rent. The operator will be able to set his costs against those tolls. The clause would allow the operator to write off the cost of the road over a period of years—is it 4 per cent. per annum over 25 years? That will reduce tax liability. Can my right hon. Friend confirm that, when cost comparisons have been made, not only the cash flow advantage to the taxpayer but the taxation consequences for the private sector operator will be taken into account? We could men reach a net rather than a gross cost to the taxpayer. We have to take account of the tax consequences of projects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am not careful, I could make a substantial response. The hon. Member for Durham, North-West talked about the interaction between transport and the environment; the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Timms) discussed the relationship between Government and industry and other hon. Members mentioned the A1, the M1 and the railway, which is where many members of the Committee would like to be. I intend no discourtesy to any hon. Members who have spoken, but I would like to reply in writing to some of them. I reject vigorously what was said about the relationship between Government and industry, and much of what Opposition Members said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak briefly about the amendment. There is nothing sinister about amendment No. 207. It would enable not only traffic flow but, for example, safety to be taken into account. We can build such factors in to the deal with the contractors. The amendment is not based only on the amount of traffic. That is why the amendment was accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must understand that it is precisely because that amendment does not depend any more on traffic flow that we were not prepared to oppose it. We want to make sure that the Government recognise that traffic flow should not be included as the means of payment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It might help to clarify our position if I reminded those on both Front Benches that we have agreed to amendment No. 207. We are now on clause 87 stand part. I am sure that we shall soon reach our conclusion and that we shall all be fresher on Tuesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me conclude here. The clause enables a productive partnership between the Government
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0785">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>499</span>
and the private sector to modernise the infrastructure of this country. The clause is about roads but the partnership extends to the Northern line and railway lines. The fact that the clause is about roads does not mean that the partnership cannot apply elsewhere; it does. The private finance initiative applies throughout the public sector. I hope that the Committee will support that approach, which will mean that we will get more infrastructure for a given public pound.
