<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
LIABILITY OF TRUSTEES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hilary Armstrong <span class='memberconstituency'>(Durham, North-west)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Welcome, Mr. Winterton. I am pleased to hear that you have had an eventful weekend; I cannot say the same for myself—I spent the weekend trying to ensure that I had a voice with which to speak this morning. It is certainly better now than it was last night.<br><br>
We had a full debate on clause 91 during the Committee stage on the Floor of the House. In that debate I raised several issues and we tabled an amendment that was not selected. We tried to probe the Government on how strong was their confidence that their measures would meet the aims and objectives that they outlined. Serious issues arise from self-assessment. Despite the Minister's assurances on the Floor of the House, many outside organisations are still not reassured. The more those organisations examine the proposals, the more concerned they become.<br><br>
I understand that the clause is mainly technical, providing that where a trust has more than one trustee, payments of tax, penalties, interest and surcharges may be collected from any trustee. The Faculty of Taxation wants trustees to have a statutory right to claim reimbursement from other trustees when the assets of the trust are not sufficient to meet the tax payments. What is the Minister's opinion of that? I shall keep returning to this issue. How confident is he that, by continually reassessing, reopening and making yet more technical adjustments to legislation, the Government are simplifying the taxation system?<br><br>
The first set of clauses that we shall deal with this morning amend the Taxes Management Act 1970 in preparation for self-assessment. They deal mainly with technical changes to the means of collection and the administration of the tax system. But, despite the aim of simplification—an aim that we support—increasingly the recurring result is technically complex legislation. That point was made last week in respect of other clauses, but these clauses are designed to enable the self-employed and others to fill in tax forms much more easily, to save everyone money, to simplify the system and to enable people to enter into self-assessment happily and confidently.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 502</span>
The more that I discuss this matter with people outside, the less confident I am because they show less and less confidence that that overall aim can be achieved. Potentially, there could be an enormous uprising of people who have been trying to sort out their tax affairs honestly and straightforwardly, but who will face such technical problems that it will cost them a significant amount to employ people to work things out in the early days. We shall deal later with that aspect of the Bill that spells out the problem for employers.<br><br>
When we discussed clause 91, I asked how far advanced the Government were in the training of Inland Revenue staff. Discussions with its representatives show that they are not confident that training is advancing with the speed or clarity that the House expects. What is happening there?<br><br>
Inevitably, new systems have to be introduced into the Inland Revenue. We live in an age where most such work is carried out by new technology. The Inland Revenue is investigating what form of new technology and what systems should be in place to administer such tasks. How far advanced is the move towards new equipment and programming? Will the Inland Revenue deal with that matter internally or will it be part of the private finance initiative, where it is put out to private tender and subjected to the same treatment as other capital programmes? How much testing will there be of any new equipment and programmes before the system comes into operation?<br><br>
We have many bad memories of new programmes being introduced. When the changes in income support were introduced in the DSS, I remember visiting my local social security office when it was on its fifth rewrite and redesign of the software. That caused local staff enormous problems and claimants even greater ones. The Government cannot afford that sort of disruption among people whom they want to engage in self-assessment. The livelihoods of such people—especially of the self-employed—depends on their ability to sort out their tax affairs with clarity so that they know where they will be at the end of the year. Taxation is an important part of their overall financial stability. If they face the upheaval and uncertainty that many predict with the introduction of self-assessment, there will be an outcry of the sort that we have not heard in the taxation world for many a long year.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary must know as well as I do that many self-employed people already approach tax matters with, to put it mildly, trepidation. That is why it is even more important that we lead them into this change in a way that gives them confidence in the process. They must understand it and know what is being asked of them. They must know how they will be dealt with and the precise boundaries within which they are expected to work.<br><br>
We shall return to that matter repeatedly this morning and, I suspect, this afternoon. I hope that the Financial Secretary will discuss training and the introduction of new technology. I shall take a rest now, so that my voice has a chance to recover.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sir George Young)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clause is a rather narrow one. It brings the rules for trustees in line with self-assessment. I shall deal with the question that was posed by the hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Ms Armstrong) about the liability
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0789">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 503</span>
of trustees. She also made some important general points which, to some extent, we rehearsed in a debate on the Floor of the House. I shall answer her question about staff training and technology, but it would be difficult to deal with all aspects of self-assessment in this debate. I shall begin by explaining what the clause will do and then respond to her question about trustees indemnifying themselves.<br><br>
This clause and clause 101, which we shall discuss later, will introduce the provisions necessary to apply the new system of self-assessment to trusts where there is more than one trustee. Trustees are jointly liable for tax due on income and gains of the trust and each trustee is liable for all the tax due, not just a share of it. The clause will not affect that basic position. It is a mechanical provision providing for the assessment and collection of tax from trustees.<br><br>
In practice, trustees usually arrange for one of their number—the principal acting trustee—to deal with the Inland Revenue on their behalf. The effect of the clause is that where the principal acting trustee notifies liability, makes a return of trust income or gains or makes a self-assessment, his actions will be treated as meeting the tax obligations of the trustees as a whole. That is convenient both for trustees and for the Revenue and it reduces compliance and administrative costs.<br><br>
Conversely, if the principal acting trustee fails to meet any tax obligations and that failure is not remedied by his fellow trustees, the effect of the clause will be to treat all the liable trustees as having failed to meet them. In those circumstances, the clause will allow the Inland Revenue to recover tax, interest, penalties or surcharges from any liable trustee if, for whatever reason, it is unable to obtain payment from the principal acting trustee. The basic, underlying position is not affected by the clause, nor are the responsibilities of trustees. However, the way that the new system will work under self-assessment is changed.<br><br>
We considered the question of trustees indemnifying themselves from trust funds in the 1991 consultative document. We considered the possibility of providing trustees with a statutory right of indemnity in the document on income tax and capital gains tax treatment of United Kingdom resident trusts. However, we concluded that it was sufficient to rely on the position under trust law, which generally allows trustees to recover tax and interest on tax that is paid late from the trust funds. In the case of penalties and surcharges, allowing trustees a right of recovery from the trust would be unfair to beneficiaries, so we did not proceed with it.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Ms Armstrong) touched upon two important issues—training and information technology. She was right to point out that the introduction of self-assessment is an important reform which has implications for taxpayers and for Inland Revenue staff. Some 40,000 staff have already received training on customer service. There is a four-year training programme, which is designed to give our staff the skills that they will need to introduce self-assessment. That programme is being devised in consultation with trade unions and staff and the process is going well. Of course, Inland Revenue will also provide information to taxpayers through a publicity campaign and through the tax inquiry centres, of which there are 400. Their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 504</span>
resources will also be available to help to keep taxpayers fully informed.<br><br>
I shall deal specifically with the training programme. More than 30 separate courses are available to Revenue staff. Each one is designed to meet the specific needs of its target audience. They are geared to equip staff with the knowledge and skills that they will need to meet the demands that they are likely to face. For example, besides the basic training that is available to all staff, whatever their job, tax inspectors are receiving intensive training on the technical aspects of the changes that were introduced by the 1994 Finance Act. That, of course, will be supplemented by training on the changes that are being brought in this year. Likewise, other groups of staff will receive training that is tailored to meet their own specific needs.<br><br>
As I said, it is an ambitious training programme which is kept under constant review. It is being developed in close consultation with Revenue staff and trade unions. It is designed to ensure that the Revenue can cope with the introduction of self-assessment, not only meeting its own needs but helping taxpayers meet their new obligations.<br><br>
On the question of information technology, the Revenue expects the new system to be delivered on time and also that it will work. However, as part of its proper management of the risks inherent in any large project, there are mitigation strategies and fall-back plans. Those include identifying the most critical aspects of the new system—for example, accounting for taxpayers' money—and giving those priority while introducing the IT systems in tranches rather than all at once. The Revenue will be buying proven products where possible, not trying to develop a new system in-house.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the Revenue will rely on the expertise of another country that has been involved in self-assessment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady knows, the system has been developed by EDS, which will use the best technology available. Some of it may be introduced from countries that are further down the self-assessment track than we are. What is important is that the system is being developed in parallel with piloting the new system—the tax returns are being filled in by volunteers and the system will be introduced incrementally so that people are not confronted with a completely new system. The programme has been broken down into critical tranches. The technology will be proven and not new whenever that makes sense.<br><br>
In fairness to the Revenue, it has a good track record of introducing computer-based projects on time, on target and within budget. I am taking a close interest in the development of technology associated with the programme. It is on track and I am confident that it will be available when needed.<br><br>
The hon. Lady spoke in alarmist terms about an uprising. I hope that she is wrong. The piloting of the forms with volunteer taxpayers is going well. Many find it simpler. When the new returns were most recently tested, 90 per cent. of the volunteers filled in the forms in a way that the Inland Revenue could process. In the spring, another 5,000 volunteers will be filling in returns on the new tax forms. There is a progressive programme
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0790">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 505</span>
of amendment, improvement and adaptation of the forms so that when they are received through letter boxes in April 1997, the three or four-year programme of introduction and implementation will have made them as perfect as possible.<br><br>
The clause amends the rules for trustees to bring them in line with self-assessment. I am happy to answer any other questions when we debate relevant clauses. Clause 93 might give us an opportunity to discuss some of the items mentioned by the hon. Lady, such as compliance costs for the self-employed and small business men. In the meantime, I hope that clause 90 is agreed to.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, Mr. Winterton. I hope that you have the eventful week that you forecasted.<br><br>
I want to raise the matter of the cost to employers of the measures in the clause that put a statutory duty on them to provide information to their employees about the new tax system. I was in some difficulty when I first considered the clause. Unfortunately, I did not take part in the debates on the Floor on the House, but I agreed in principle with self-assessment. I thought it sounded a wonderful opportunity to fill in one's own tax form and to decide how much to pay the Revenue. If the information was not right, it could be put right the following year. I found myself agreeing with the Government, which is unusual because during the past 15 years I have been trying to find ways to disagree with them.<br><br>
The principle of self-assessment is right, but it will be culture shock to the tax system. Despite all the attempts to use volunteers to test the system, it will still be a major change which the people who have to fill in the forms will not understand. What size will the tax form be? One estimate is 17 pages.<br><br>
I am concerned about the cost to small employers. The Government have included many measures in the Bill to assist small and medium-sized employers to develop their businesses and create jobs, but the only jobs that will be created by clause 93 are for accountants. Employers will need accounts to help them understand all the details of the clause. It is a culture shock and it will be some time before people understand it properly. The Government talk about simplifying the tax regime, but the clause is two and a half pages long. The preamble on self-assessment in the Budget press release was only two or three lines.<br><br>
A new regime of self-assessment for about 8 million people is being introduced at a time when the number of tax inspectors is being reduced. This measure alone will reduce the number of Inland Revenue staff by almost 3,000. When the complicated new regime is introduced, how will extra assistance be given to the many small firms
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 506</span>
that will have problems completing the form? The scheme is almost a mix-and-match tax system. It will not help the Revenue to gain the full momentum from the tax regime. Experienced, fully trained staff will be needed to help companies and employees understand what is happening.<br><br>
When we discussed clause 90, the Minister referred to discussions with trade unions about implementation. The unions are concerned about the clause and its effects on their members. During the consultation exercise, 1,300 copies of the document on self-assessment were sent out, but only 70 replies were received. Great analysis was carried out on those 70 replies, but they do not constitute evidence of full and extensive consultation. Indeed, the Confederation of British Industry, which has members on the Inland Revenue self-assessment working group, said in its report to members that many of the concerns that it raised have not been met.<br><br>
We need to consider how the self-assessment system could be introduced with more care and a greater understanding of the problems which small companies, in particular, will face. The costs to employers should be quantified and the level of understanding of employees should be examined. In what way do the Government believe employers should pass on information to their employees? Have the Government spoken to the Trades Union Congress about encouraging the unions to examine the various tax measures that are available? The clause as a whole puts an inappropriate burden on business.<br><br>
The press is also concerned about self-assessment. One journal calls it a "nasty surprise that lurks ahead". The article is accompanied by a picture of the Chancellor, which is a nasty surprise for anybody. To ensure that the measure is accurate and appropriate, the Government should spend more time considering how employers can be helped. They need to ensure that the self-assessment forms can be easily understood and that they provide the appropriate information.<br><br>
The clause provides an opportunity to go back five years, which is a nonsense. It will make a mess of the tax system. Rather than simplifying matters, the Government are unnecessarily complicating the tax system and I ask them to reconsider.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Milburn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Darlington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This the second year in which we have discussed self-assessment during the proceedings of the Finance Bill. During the Committee proceedings on the Floor of the House on 25 January, the Minister promised that we would have another opportunity to do so again next year because the Treasury intends to introduce further proposals to clarify how self-assessment will work.<br><br>
There is a consensus among Labour Members on the benefits of self-assessment in principle, but some concern about the way in which it will operate in practice. Clause 93 gives cause for concern. The virtues of self-assessment have been spelt out in successive Finance Bills as being a reduction in bureaucracy, a smoothlining of the system and a reduction in administration and red tape. It would be difficult to argue with any of those objectives, but there is a price to be paid. The other side of the equation is that employees and small employers will face an additional administrative burden. The clause imposes an additional requirement on employers to report information not only to the Inland Revenue—they have had to do that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0791">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 507</span>
traditionally—but to their employees, so that the employees understand the assessment that their employers have made of their benefits-in-kind.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) alluded to the consultation exercise last year. On 9 May 1994, the Revenue distributed its document:
<br><blockquote><p>"Self assessment: what it will mean for employers and employees"</p></blockquote>
and I understand that there was a two-month consultation period ending in July last year. I read the responses with interest in the Inland Revenue press release which was issued on Budget day last year. The document was widely distributed and 1,300 copies were sent to a variety of organisations—employers' organisations, employers and the accountancy and financial advice professions—yet only about 70 written responses were received. The Treasury formulated the provisions on the basis of 70 responses. The Treasury cannot claim that that sample is sufficiently scientific on which to base wide-ranging new measures that will have an impact on small businesses.<br><br>
A penalty regime will be imposed on employers who fail to provide information accurately and on time. Although 55 per cent. of responses agreed to the proposals of those employers who bothered to respond a startling two in three disagreed with them. I wonder whether the Minister might have taken a little more time to consider the matter in view of that low rate of response. I do not doubt that the Treasury did all that it could in the first phase of consultation to encourage responses, but I wonder whether it might have thought about going a little further and perhaps reissuing the document and retargeting it to other organisations to see whether it raises a better response.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
As my hon. Friend said, concern has been expressed about the additional burdens that the clause will impose on business. I noted what the Minister said on the Floor of the House when he suggested that self-assessment was a good way of freeing-up resources. Indeed, in that sense he echoed what was said by the previous Financial Secretary—now the Secretary of State for National Heritage—in this Committee last year. He said, "It will allow it—that is, the Inland Revenue—
<br><blockquote><p>"to target its resources more accurately on real problems rather than adding up rows of figures that the taxpayer has already added up accurately so that the inspector can satisfy himself that the arithmetic is correct."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 15 February 1994; <i>c.</i> 198.]</p></blockquote>
That sounds very worthy, but concerns remain. They were, perhaps, best expressed by the CBI in responding to self-assessment. It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The cost implications in terms of staff resources and time have raised substantial worries for member companies."</p></blockquote>
That is not surprising because, as I understand it—I hope that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—there is not even a de minimis limit on the expenses and income that are to be declared by employers. We can imagine a small employer having to scrabble around and look back on a year's figures to put together information for the Revenue and to communicate that information to employees. That may mean less paperwork, less bureaucracy and less administrative time for the Revenue,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 508</span>
but it will mean more administrative time, more paperwork and more red tape for the employer.<br><br>
The Committee will appreciate the problems faced by small businesses. We are sympathetic to the fact that small businesses already face major administrative burdens in dealing with the VAT man, the Revenue, the local authority and all the regulations that relate to operating in a trading environment. I thought that the Government's policy was, in that hackneyed phrase, to reduce the burdens on businesses and, in particular, the burdens on the self-employed. Yet this is a graphic example of the way in which additional burdens will be placed on small companies and the self-employed.<br><br>
I know that the Minister will say that that is not a problem because small businesses and the self-employed will be able to turn to professional advisers to assist them in dealing with the additional burdens that they face. However, there are two problems. The first is that many self-employed people have very low incomes. The Minister will be aware of the fact that many self-employed people are finding it so difficult to make ends meet that they are taking on a second, or even a third, job to supplement their incomes. In such circumstances, I doubt whether many self-employed people will be able to turn to professional accountants and financial advisers for the assistance that they need in order accurately to fill in the forms to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South alluded—heaven help us all if it is a 17-page form—to communicate that information not only to the Revenue but, equally importantly, to any employees on their books.<br><br>
The second problem is broad, and I mentioned it when I spoke in the Committee of the whole House in January. The essence of self-assessment seems to be a privatisation of taxation returns. In the current system, individuals or employers have assistance provided by the Revenue to ensure that their tax returns are correct and that they are properly assessed. In future, however, those people will have to do that job themselves. Inevitably, given the tax system's complex nature, if those people are able to, they will have to turn to professional financial advice to assist them in that process. That advice will have a cost to employers. How much assessment has there been of the likely financial costs that employers—especially small businesses—will have to bear as a consequence of clause 93? Any measure that imposes additional financial burdens on small businesses should be fully evaluated before it is introduced. I hope that the Financial Secretary will be able to provide assurances on that matter when he replies.<br><br>
I am also concerned about the nature of the information and forms with which employers will be confronted. That issue has been raised not only by the Opposition but by a range of commentators, business organisations and small businesses. Will the Financial Secretary squash once and for all the rumour alluded to by my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South—that the self-assessment form will be very long? Will individuals really be faced with a 17-page, complex form?<br><br>
Will the right hon. Gentleman also supply more information on how the consultation exercise on the formulation of the form is progressing and, in particular—as I asked on the Floor of the House—whether the Plain English Campaign has been consulted on the issue? We are all for plain English. I often hear the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0792">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 509</span>
City of Chester (Mr. Brandreth) speaking anything but plain English on the Floor of the House while advocating the need to keep things as simple as possible That is certainly essential in the case of tax affairs. The last thing we want is for impenetrable information to be sent out to small businesses. That will not help them nor will it help the Revenue to do the work that it is qualified to do. Will the right hon. Gentleman deal with that issue and inform us of tangible ways in which he expects the business community—in particular the self-employed and small businesses—to be informed about what will happen?<br><br>
Many financial commentators think that self-assessment is a lurker—a "bad 'un"—waiting to explode in the Government's face. None of us want that to happen—<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Government Whip laughs. We do not want self-assessment to be a lurker not least because a general election may be in the offing. By the time that self-assessment is fully introduced it is likely that we shall have had a general election That observation is due to no special knowledge on my part. When we are in Government I do not think that our Ministers will want that lurker to explode in their faces. We Opposition Members do not want it to explode in the faces of Conservative Ministers either because we are generous individuals.<br><br>
Self-assessment would seem to impose significant additional burdens on small businesses in particular and I should be grateful if the right hon. Gentleman could tell us what sort of publicity campaign is planned. I hope that the one that he has in mind has better results than the consultation exercise that was undertaken in the middle of last year and that produced such a poor response. It is vital that employers find out quickly what is in the offing. The change is some way down the line, but the public education programme must begin as soon as possible.<br><br>
As the measure will affect employees as well as employers, what plans does the Minister have to ensure that the message reaches employees about what they should expect from their employers in future? My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South described the changes as a culture shock. That is a generous interpretation of self-assessment. There must be a fairly long lead time to ensure that the message hits home.<br><br>
Finally, what sort of assessments will the Revenue make of the forms—17 pages long or otherwise—once they are returned? I was concerned to read an article in the <i>Financial Times</i> on 24 February entitled "Nasty surprise lurks ahead", which dealt with how the self-assessment system will work:
<br><blockquote><p>"The system is based on the idea of 'process now, check later', in that, apart from obvious errors, the taxpayer's figures are accepted. However, all returns will be checked but only a sample will be reviewed and taxpayers interviewed."</p></blockquote>
Can the Minister supply more details on that aspect? I raised the issue in my contribution on the Floor of the House and he did not have the opportunity to give me a reply. To what extent will self-assessment forms be nodded through?<br><br>
Is the <i>Financial Times</i> article right to claim that all returns will be checked? What will be the sample size of those forms that are returned? How many will be properly reviewed? The last thing we want is for self-assessment to give the green light for tax avoidance. Has the Minister any idea of possible negative implications of self-assessment on revenue flow into the Treasury? What
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 510</span>
specific safeguards does he contemplate building in to ensure that incorrect returns do not find their way through the system? We must be assured that self-assessed forms are properly monitored and reviewed and that mistakes are spotted as quickly as possible.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
When the Financial Secretary responds to that point perhaps he will give the extent of staff redeployment opportunities. There has been much talk about thousands of Inland Revenue staff either losing their jobs or being redeployed—both the Financial Secretary and his predecessor in last year's Committee were extremely coy about those figures. The time has come to give the Committee firm information on the Revenue's intentions in terms of the number of members of staff who will be redeployed into assessment, monitoring and review. The Financial Secretary's predecessor spoke last year about how the change to self-assessment would allow the Revenue to target its resources more accurately on real problems and on ensuring that accurate returns were made.<br><br>
In principle, the Opposition still support self-assessment, but the Minister cannot duck the fact that there are concerns about the introduction of the new system. When we discuss clause 110 and schedule 22, the Minister will be aware that that is not the only burden that small employers will have to bear. For those at the receiving end, the changes will be complex and difficult to assimilate. The Revenue want the system to be as streamlined and as unburdened with bureaucracy as possible—we must have assurances that self-assessment will not mean that there will be greater scope for tax avoidance than at present. I hope that the Minister will address those issues when he replies to the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot help but feel that this may be a deregulation too far. The Government have based their swathe of proposals for self-assessment and deregulation on the need to simplify, yet the proposal contains considerable scope to complicate.<br><br>
As I understand the present system, there is no obligation for an employer to provide information to the employee—the employer makes a return to the Revenue, which carries out the assessment. I am not suggesting for one moment that that is a simple operation—that process clearly contains all sorts of complications. But it is important to realise that the proposals contained in clause 93 impose further requirements and mechanisms. How does the Financial Secretary equate increasing the requirements on employers—increasing the mechanisms, increasing the movements and increasing the necessary flow of paperwork—with the objective of simplifying the process? That question must be answered—perhaps in greater detail than has been the case in similar debates.<br><br>
As I understand the measure, step two requires an employer to provide information to the employee—a change from the present system. Presumably, that must be done each year because returns are made each year and the information could change each year. That would be likely to involve the employer entering into detailed discussions with the employee. If I were an employee who was to be subject to the new procedure, I would want
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0793">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 511</span>
that information. The new system moves away from the Revenue's relatively objective assessments, whereby the information provided was examined objectively and within the rules. The Revenue will no longer be directly involved—its role will change. The new system is subjective to a significant degree. As a result, I would want to know in detail what information my employer was providing to the Revenue.<br><br>
The clause also requires employers to provide information on activities that may produce benefits-in-kind provided by third parties—step three. The information must be compiled and assessed, so the employer will have to set up systems to do that. Apparently, that was not previously the case. That is another way in which the clause adds complications.<br><br>
There is no de minimis limit, which seems to bring all employers into the net, regardless of the size of their operations. In the past the Government have stuck to the magical figure of 20 employees to distinguish between small and medium-sized businesses and larger businesses. That requirement does not appear in the measure, although those earning less than £8,500—presumably including both income and benefits-in-kind—will not be caught.<br><br>
However, closer examination reveals that subsection (3) provides that the notice may specify named employees, so the employer will have the facility to name employees, or all employees, which would be the choice for an employer who employs a small number of people, all of whom earn more than £8,500, or all employees who have been covered by the statutory rules taxing benefits and expenses paid to directors. That gives the employer three choices, which some might say is right and proper, but I would argue that it imposes unnecessary complication and adds yet another requirement to what is supposed to be a simplifying measure. I hope that me Financial Secretary will provide clarification in his response because there is a real worry that the proposal will complicate the system, rather than simplify it.<br><br>
To recap, my first general point is to ask the Financial Secretary how he reconciles what appears to be a complicating measure with the Government's objective of simplifying the system. I wish to underline two aspects of the burden on employers. First, I cannot for the life of me understand how the measure will reduce the administrative and paperwork burden on employers. It defies logic to suggest that it will, because the employer will have to take actions that will generate extra administration and paperwork that was not required before. The Financial Secretary always explains matters in great detail and we thank him for that. He needs to explain in as much detail as possible how he views what appears to be the near certainty that the proposals will increase the administrative burden on employers, small and large alike, and generate a significant amount of additional paperwork. Many of us fear that, and it is, to be charitable, almost inevitable.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary must explain in great detail how that is to be avoided. If he accepts that there will be an additional administrative burden and additional paperwork for employers, let him say so. If he does not accept that, let him explain how the measure will reduce the administrative burden on employers and the amount of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 512</span>
paperwork that they will have to deal with. We await his response to that critical point with great interest.<br><br>
If the Financial Secretary says—not for the first time—that I am talking nonsense, we shall be able to argue the matter through here and on Report, but if he accepts that additional burdens will be put on employers, we should examine my second point, which relates to costs. We hear so much from Conservative Members about costs on employers and the effects that the social chapter would have in that respect, yet all the evidence suggests that the clause will put additional costs on employers. I readily accept that there is an income de minimis limit, but there is no such limit in terms of the number of employees, so businesses employing relatively few people will be caught in the net. Those are precisely the businesses for which the Government have embarked on what is often described as a crusade to avoid inflicting additional costs.<br><br>
I am never quite sure what to make of comments by Ministers on the thorny issue of consultation. I am not sure whether they are talking about carrying out consultation and then ignoring the replies, or consultation that is so minimal that it is meaningless, or consultation that is then used to justify what they wanted to do in the first place. Nevertheless, consultation took place. As I understand the Treasury's press release IR29, 1,300 copies of the document were issued. I do not know whom they were issued to, but I have checked with people in my area and so far—though I have not yet checked with everybody—the reply that I have received is, "What document are you talking about?"<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
I want first to know where the consultation took place. The press release mentions several sectors to which the document was sent, but it would be useful to know exactly where the documents went and whom the Government consulted, rather than being given only the broad span of consultees. When we go back to our constituencies we ask people their views and find out whether they are geared up for the changes. It is no good if they say, "What are you talking about? Where is this document?" and I have to reply, "Well, hang on a second. I'll phone the Treasury up and get a copy for you so that you can let me know what you think about it."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the consultees did not represent a broad span and a response rate of 70 is statistically insignificant? The statistical analysis in the press release is, therefore, of spurious relevance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making a point that I was about to make. That will shorten my contribution slightly, which I am sure you will appreciate, Mr. Winterton. Having said that, I shall now repeat the point, though I am grateful to my hon. Friend. With friends like that, who needs enemies?<br><br>
I understand that 70 written replies were received to 1,300 documents issued we know not where, except that, in general terms, they went to representative bodies and associations, employers and accountants, whom I shall talk about in a moment.<br><br>
Who were those 70 who replied? I shall deal with the broad brush analysis of the replies in a moment. With
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0794">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 513</span>
such a sea change as self-assessment and deregulation, we should have a teeny weeny bit more evidence than 70 written replies from across the country. The Financial Secretary will have a task to convince us that the consultation got to the target. Did it really get to the coal face or only to some amorphous associations whose members have not been in a factory for a long time? Were the people who will be affected consulted or was it just some well-meaning, long-standing associations? I have done some checking—as I believe we have a responsibility to do—and people have asked me what I was talking about.<br><br>
The press release IR29 sets out the split on the responses. I am not in a position to suggest that the Government are massaging or manipulating the responses, although it is not unknown for Government statistics to be manipulated. One is struck by the percentage of respondents who said, "Government, you're doing a good job. Good stuff, this. Well done." Seventy five per cent. of representative bodies and 90 per cent. of employers appear to have responded in that way. Should I extrapolate from the latter figure that nine out of 10 employers in my constituency think that the reform is a good thing? I have spoken to a few of them, and they do not know anything about it. One must, therefore, view the figures with a tinge of caution.<br><br>
The first thing that one sees is a phalanx of statistics that suggest that the Government are doing exactly the right thing, and a grand job. The Financial Secretary should clarify the situation.<br><br>
I am struck by the fact that 75 per cent. of representative bodies and associations are providing details of expenses, payments and benefits in kind—presumably, that means 75 per cent. of the 70 that put in written responses. They have said that the reform is all right. Likewise, 90 per cent. of employers have said that it is all right., and 90 per cent. of accountants said the same thing.<br><br>
I shall give some figures relating to the calculated benefit in kind, and the percentages of those who approve of the reform: 65 per cent. of representative bodies, and 80 per cent. of accountants. The penalty regime is being extended. The percentage for representative bodies is 45 per cent., so they are not very happy. The percentage for employers is 35 per cent., so they are even less happy. They can see the minefield that has been laid for them. One could go on. The message is clear: the only people who think that the measure is good are accountants. The Government cannot pick bits and pieces from their de minimis consultation, which has consistent support only from accountants. I am not surprised, because employers will increasingly need the services of accountants and financial experts to guide them through the increasingly complex jungle that the Government are creating.<br><br>
My last point—<i>[Interruption.]</i> Well, almost my last. <i>[Laughter.]</i> It is sometimes difficult to make a serious point. I have a question—and I might have to respond when the Financial Secretary replies—and a request. I was interested earlier when the Financial Secretary suggested that the Government are, quite rightly, saying, "Self-assessment is extremely important." I think that we all agree that it represents a significant sea change, although one could argue that it represents a deregulation too far.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 514</span>
The Financial Secretary laid great emphasis on the pilot schemes. He mentioned 5,000 volunteer taxpayers. It is interesting that the Government have managed to dig up some volunteer taxpayers. Goodness gracious! I suppose that that should be in their next election manifesto. The Government have said that the change is radical, and that they should test the temperature of the water. It is important to know what people think of the reform, and to learn from mistakes. It is also important to compile the paperwork in a realistic way.<br><br>
The previous proposals that the Financial Secretary discussed do not come into effect until 1997. The current proposals affect tax year 1996–97. Presumably, the paperwork will not be required until a year after that date. The Government therefore presumably intend to bring in the reforms in 1996. Are the Government introducing a pilot scheme, or schemes—or even a pilot assessment—for the reform? They are, rightly, doing that with other reforms. If the answer is yes, the Government should give details of that scheme. If the answer is no, why are they not doing so? It seems to be an excellent idea. For such changes, one needs a clear view of the purposes involved, and one must canvass the opinions at the coal face. That is particularly important, because there has been a pretty patchy consultation exercise.<br><br>
We have a phrase in north Staffordshire: "scrawny". You may have heard of it, Mr. Winterton. I should describe the consultation exercise as scrawny. It resembles a rabbit that has had a bad winter. I do not want to prejudge events on Friday, but I suspect that if the rabbit were pulled out from under a hedge, one would have a pretty scrawny looking specimen. If there is a pilot scheme, we want the details; if there is not, why not? It would be interesting if there were a pilot scheme among accountants. The pilot scheme would be welcomed by the Opposition and by the employers who will be affected by the proposed dramatic change in the tax system.<br><br>
Self-assessment seems to be the flavour of the month. We shall see how it works out, but several hon. Members are worried about it. A move from objectivity to subjectivity will be involved, and we have seen over the years that subjectivity involves temptations and problems. I hope that such problems will not arise, but the proposals in clause 93, for example, will make the temptations greater. What burdens will be imposed on employers? How have those burdens been quantified? What responses have there been from employers at the coal face? We know the views of representative bodies and accountants. Have employees or trade unions been consulted? Are they aware of the changes? If a pilot scheme is good enough for other areas of self-assessment and deregulation, the Financial Secretary should confirm that a pilot scheme will be introduced in the present area as well.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) for allowing me the time to make a brief contribution before luncheon.<br><br>
I was pleased to hear of the extensive piloting and trialling of forms for the implementation of self-assessment. It was encouraging to hear about that from the Financial Secretary. Several of my hon. Friends and I are worried about the compliance costs for sole traders and small businesses as a result of the move to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0795">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 515</span>
self-assessment. We have heard the concerns of the Confederation of British Industry. My favourite CBI quote about the impact of self-assessment is:
<br><blockquote><p>"we remain firmly of the view that the additional compliance burdens and costs which will be imposed on employers and employees by the new regime have not yet been fully recognised. This is the more so because the existing archaic Schedule E expenses and benefits rules from which much of the self-assessment problem flows, do not properly reflect modem business practice and changing patterns of work involving much more UK and international travel, within the Single European Market and elsewhere, and accordingly continue to impose disproportionate compliance burdens."</p></blockquote>
That is true. The proposals in this clause and other relevant clauses do not appear to be completely streetwise.<br><br>
I want to concentrate on four issues. The first, which is minor, concerns section 15(4) which states that a notice may require the names and addresses of employees to be provided. I want the Financial Secretary's assurance that employers will not have the extra burden imposed on them of trying to keep track of former employees who may have left the company three, four or even five years earlier. That would be ridiculous and I assume that it is not the intention.<br><br>
The second issue concerns section 15(5) which provides that particulars of relevant payments by the employer or by another person who has been arranged by the employer might have to be given. That requirement has exercised the minds of the members of the Chartered Institute of Taxation which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is great concern expressed by employers as to how this requirement is going to be satisfied in practice. We believe that a much greater flexibility is required with respect to the returning of relevant payments provided by someone other than the employer."</p></blockquote>
That is a valid point. We could all recall examples of a sole trader or a small business, such as one specialising in interim management, employing someone who is paid a small salary but who is subcontracted to another business or employer, the fee for which has been negotiated by the original employer. That employer might not know how much his employee is being paid on a subcontract basis. He has only negotiated a fee for the privilege of using that employee. In such circumstances, it is nonsense to expect the original employer to provide details of payments.<br><br>
Section 15(5) also states that the employer might have to provide the names and business addresses of any third parties which, to his knowledge but not by his arrangement, have been making relevant payments to his employees. In today's business world, many small businesses employ on a part-time basis. They can pay employees substantial sums but only to work two or three days a week. Will an employer have to spy on his employee to discover his other business? Should an employer cock a deaf 'un, as they say in the black country, about the other work activities of his employee? If an employee casually informs an employer, perhaps at an office Christmas party, that he is also working for someone else, will that have to be disclosed on the tax returns?<br><br>
The third issue concerns section 15(8) which deals with benefits. I am especially worried that an employee might receive benefits in kind that he did not want to receive. If an employer goes over-budget on the Christmas party and the additional costs are apportioned among his staff, will that be declared as a benefit in kind in the tax return?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 516</span>
There are several examples of an employee receiving benefits in kind that he might not want and which would not normally be described as a benefit in kind. I am not talking about the 2,000-quid-a-head bashes of merchant banks, but more normal and perhaps more sober affairs.<br><br>
My fourth concern is whether section 15(9) can be implemented in practice. It states that an employer might be required to provide the names and business addresses of any third parties which, to his knowledge but not by his arrangement, have been providing benefits to his employees. If I ran a small company and one of my employees was taken out to the Cheltenham Gold Cup for a meal and was royally entertained, would I have to disclose the business address of the third party? Would I know about that happening? If someone were to take me to a private box to watch England win the grand slam at rugby—I am open to offers—would that have to be regarded as a benefit in kind and therefore declared on the tax form? I am worried about the practicality of some of the requirements. I look forward to hearing the Financial Secretary's comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends have asked a number of pertinent questions. The clause refers to the duties of employers to provide information to their employees about benefits. However, if an employer employs anyone on a salary of £8,500 including benefits, the employer is liable. My hon. Friends have highlighted the fact that, far from that being deregulatory, it is going to impose additional burdens on businesses of all sizes. Not many people are employed in business for less than that salary if the job involves any management or junior management.<br><br>
The majority of employers will be caught by the clause, which expands the amount of paperwork and regulation with which employers will have to comply in order to meet the demands of self-assessment. Apart from the issue of deregulation, the clause seems to impose many additional burdens on employers. I was disappointed with the Minister's answers.<br><br>
From my discussions with outside organisations, I know that far from being satisfied that the self-assessment measures will ease the burden on employers, it is thought that the measures will increase those burdens. The Institute of Taxation said that
<br><blockquote><p>"the most obvious result of the proposals will be a significant increase in compliance costs for employers"—</p></blockquote>
not only because of,
<br><blockquote><p>"the annual information that employees generally will need if required to complete a tax return but also because employers will find themselves supporting the Inland Revenue's efforts to make employees more tax aware."</p></blockquote>
That is one of the reasons given by the Institute of Taxation for increased expenditure by employers. It went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Increasing taxpayer awareness on this scale involves a change in culture and attitude that may well take a generation to achieve. In the meantime the employer is inevitably likely to bear the brunt of employee difficulties and indeed we believe that self assessment for employees cannot be made to work by the Inland revenue without the active co-operation of very many employers."</p></blockquote>
The clause makes it clear that not only must employers cooperate in making employees more aware of tax matters, but employers must cooperate in providing detailed information.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0796">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 517</span>
An article in the <i>Financial Times</i> on Friday highlighted what other employers' representatives have said. It stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"After the publication of the draft law which puts the Budget into effect, the Confederation of British Industry, the employers' group, said: 'The cost implications in terms of staff resources and time have raised substantial worries for member companies.' The Institute of Directors echoed such anxieties—particularly for small businesses."</p></blockquote>
Despite the Minister's reassurances, anxieties remain among employers and, certainly, among those who represent employers in tax matters, such as the Institute of Taxation.<br><br>
I am especially concerned about the pilot studies because I know that some people do not think that they are going that well. We have heard members of the Committee raise issues identified in the Government's press release about the low response to one of the Government's surveys. The article by Jim Kelly in the <i>Financial Times</i> concludes:
<br><blockquote><p>"Recent problems with the pilot have emphasised the importance of simplifying tax returns and eliminating the need for back-up documentation."</p></blockquote>
The Minister seemed to imply that there were no problems with the pilot. Have other people, who have talked to the Opposition, and the <i>Financial Times</i> got it wrong? Have they misunderstood the situation because they have been talking to the wrong people? Those to whom I have spoken expressed their concern that the form should be simplified. Unless less back-up is required from employers, the system is unlikely to be the great success that the Government propound. Kim Kelly says that
<br><blockquote><p>"it is likely to prove an uncomfortable surprise for many in the UK."</p></blockquote>
12 noon<br><br>
Jim Kelly raises serious concerns about self-assessment. I am not assured that the Government have openly acknowledged the worries of many people about the mass of information and technicality that faces them with the introduction of self-assessment. I hope that what seems to be complacency on the part of the Government is not the case and that the Government have grounds for giving such assurances. We shall return to the issue again and again and, if the problems that some people anticipate actually arise, we shall return to the matter in the knowledge that we warned the Government and tried to make them address the problems before they arose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a comprehensive and wide-ranging debate touching on many aspects of self-assessment. I am grateful to the hon. Members for Bradford, South and for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) for making it clear in their speeches that they support the principle of self-assessment. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South was slightly more cautious. He referred to the idea as the flavour of the month—not quite the wholehearted endorsement that we heard from some of his colleagues on the Opposition Front Bench. He put forward the extraordinary argument that the measure must be wrong because it was supported by accountants. If his survey had shown that only 20 per cent. of accountants supported such a reform of the taxation system, he would have made a slightly different but, I suspect, more forceful speech criticising the Government.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 518</span>
The other extraordinary suggestion that he made was that we were replacing objectivity with subjectivity. That is entirely the wrong way round. In the present system, many taxpayers receive an assessment in November, which is a subjective assessment by the Inland Revenue of how much it thinks they will earn in the following year. Then there follows the whole procedure of appeal and agreement. That will be swept aside. We shall move away from subjective assessment by the Inland Revenue to objective assessment by the taxpayer of the situation in the relevant year.<br><br>
I shall try to deal with all the points raised by hon. Members, but they included a west midlands rural analogy, which was lost on me and my hon. Friends and also, I suspect, on <i>Hansard.</i> It sounded to me like dodgy behaviour, but we shall have to wait and see what <i>Hansard</i> makes of it. However, I shall deal with the specific themes that emerged during the debate.<br><br>
It was suggested that the proposal would increase costs for the taxpayer. That theme was raised by many hon. Members who were especially worried about small businesses. Many taxpayers will be assisted by the move away from assessment on a preceding year basis to assessment on a current year basis. The number of taxpayer contacts with the Revenue will be reduced by the move away from the process that I described a moment ago of Inland Revenue assessment, appeals and agreement to postpone tax. All that will disappear and, instead, there will be one assessment with all income and all gains on one piece of paper with agreed payment dates. Generally speaking, that process of reducing the number of contacts with the Inland Revenue will reduce taxpayers' costs, especially those of the self-employed. Some taxpayers, such as those with complex tax reliefs and allowances and some people who receive expense payments and benefits, may find that they have more work than at present. I shall return to that, but the key question is the compliance cost assessment, which we published on Budget day. It sounds as though the hon. Member for Darlington has not seen that and I commend it to him. It is the most detailed, honest explanation, with appendices on how the costs and benefits fall on specific groups of taxpayers. It is well worth looking at if anyone is concerned about the impact of self-assessment.<br><br>
To summarise the compliance cost assessment, which we published on Budget day, the Inland Revenue calculated annual savings of £125 million to £250 million, mostly derived from the streamlining that I have just described. It also recognises that there will be one-off costs in assimilating and adapting to the new system—the need to reorganise accounts, buy software and so on. Such one-off costs will amount to between £100 million and £200 million, including costs for employers who will have ne obligations under self-assessment. The new obligations will produce annual costs which might amount to between £20 million and £30 million a year for those businesses affected by the change. That is the background against which overall annual savings of £125 million and £250 million must be viewed. The costs to employers have been kept to a minimum following extensive consultations with representatives of business and employer organisations. I shall say something about that later.<br><br>
On the specific impact on the self-employed and smaller businesses, the compliance cost assessment,

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 519</span>
which we published last year, shows estimated average savings of between £30 and £65 for a self-employed business which does not provide benefits-in-kind to employees, costs of between £15 and £30 for a company which provides benefits to two employees, and savings of between £15 and £35 for a self-employed business providing benefits-in-kind to two employees. In the overall distribution of costs and benefits, the benefits tend to appear for the smaller self-employed and the costs tend to appear for the slightly larger companies that must issue P11D forms and work out benefits-in-kind and so on. By and large, the self-employed and smaller companies are not so entrenched in benefits-in-kind as larger companies.<br><br>
It was suggested that the measure was an ingenious device to find more work for accountants—a jobseekers' scheme for chartered accountants. That is not so. It is worth emphasising that taxpayers who do not want to travel the final mile and work out their own self-assessment will not have to. They can simply send their returns in early and leave the Revenue to work out the tax. The feedback so far on the draft tax return shows that most people did not expect to need any more help to complete it than they now require under the Revenue calculation option. Whether a professional adviser is needed is an individual decision which each taxpayer will make on the basis of his own circumstances. The Revenue will step up the assistance that it provides to taxpayers in general in written guidance, on the telephone and through its network of nearly 400 tax inquiry centres. The Revenue is doing all that it can to ensure that people will understand how the new system works and what they must do to meet their responsibilities without having to employ advisers. Even more research is being undertaken to ensure that the Revenue provides the help that best meets the needs of those affected.<br><br>
Public consultation started in November on the design of the tax return. Not only do we have volunteers filling in the tax return, people are willing to pay to buy specimens of it. We distributed as many as we thought we needed, but people wanted to see them and paid cash for them. A new version of the return will be issued for consultation in the autumn. It reflects feedback from the consultations and trials on volunteers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Milburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a slightly earlier point—the Minister referred to the possibility of the Revenue assessing the taxation position of employers and employees, but the Minister knows that substantial concern has been expressed, not least by the Public Accounts Committee, on the extent of late filing of tax returns under the current system. There is an incentive in the new system because penalties can be imposed, but what assessment has the Revenue made of the likely impact of the introduction of self-assessment on late returns or late filing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman mentioned in his speech the possible impact on Exchequer revenue of the new system. He will know of the transitional arrangements that we have put in place for 1996–97. The fact that self-assessment is underpinned by penalties, about which there has been some comment, provides added incentives for people to send off their tax returns on time. We shall monitor that aspect closely.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 520</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Milburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the Financial Secretary assessed the impact of those penalties on the many tax returns that are currently filed late?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The taxpayer will have a longer period in which to file his return. Under the new system he will be allowed 10 months whereas in theory he is currently allowed one month and in practice he is allowed six months. The system allows a more generous period and is also underpinned by penalties. I hope, therefore, that taxpayers will give the new regime a good response. If taxpayers have difficulty with the forms, they do not have to do the final calculation. They can go to a tax inquiry centre to get help and advice. We would expect them to do their best to send in the form on time. Any outstanding information could be resolved later.<br><br>
We shall monitor the new system's impact. So far, however, I have received no information to suggest an adverse effect on Exchequer revenues as we move from the current system where, as the hon. Gentleman says, there are some later returns, to the new system with a more generous time for filing the return and an underpinning by penalties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Financial Secretary's further assistance in clarifying the point made by myself and several of my hon. Friends about assessing the impact and the pilot schemes? Did the right hon. Gentleman say that, in terms of the provisions of clause 93, the new forms have been in distribution since last November? If that is the case, to what extent have they been distributed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is in a bit of a muddle. Clause 93 deals with compliance of the employer. In future, the employer must send a P11D form not only to the Revenue, but to the employee. The employee needs that information to complete his return. I shall explain how that aspect will be piloted later. However, it is important not to muddle it with the piloting of the general form—when we shall find out whether people are comfortable with it, whether they find it too long or too short, and what sort of guidance is needed.<br><br>
I was asked about the impact of the Revenue's fundamental expenditure review on self-assessment. As is the case with every organisation in the public sector, the Revenue has the obligation to run itself efficiently and to try to provide a better service at less cost to ensure that taxpayers receive value for money. The new rules will simplify the tax administration in two ways. First, the change from the preceding year basis of assessment to the current year will make it easier to calculate tax liability and to enable all sources of income to be brought together in one sum. Secondly, the move to self-assessment removes the need for estimated assessments, appeals and postponement of tax—the ritual that many taxpayers undergo during the winter. Those changes will generally reduce compliance costs, especially those of the self-employed, and simplify matters for the Revenue, which is a party to the ritual. The saving, net of those redeployed into further customer service and compliance work, will amount to 3,000 people. That is only part of the staff saving produced by the change programme. The savings from self-assessment will be taken only once the new system has bedded down and people have grown accustomed to it.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 521</span>
We did not spend much time discussing the measures in clause 93.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Milburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can I clarify the figures that the right hon. Gentleman has just given to the Committee? How many Inland Revenue staff will be redeployed into dealing with self-assessment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can give a more detailed response. Some will go into self-assessment, some into compliance. The timetable depends on the introduction of self-assessment. Instead of giving a more detailed reply off the cuff, I should prefer to reflect on what the hon. Gentleman has said and give a more detailed reply later.<br><br>
Beneficial loans have not yet been mentioned, but they are part of the equation because if an employer gives beneficial loans to employees, they count as taxable benefits which have to be filled in. To complete the picture, I should like to say a few words about the treatment of cheap or interest-free loans made to employees. Their benefit relative to a commercial rate of interest is taxable. If tax relief on a loan, say for house purchase, is due, the taxable benefit will be reduced.<br><br>
The Budget day press release said that the Inland Revenue was continuing its consultations with representatives. Those consultations are now complete, so I can say how we propose to proceed. Under self-assessment, employers will have to calculate the value of benefits for tax purposes. They will have to report the values in their end-year returns or following a notice given under the clause. Cheap loans are no exception, but some changes to the rules will be needed for calculating the value of cheap loans—otherwise, employers may not always be able to do the sums.<br><br>
In talks with the Inland Revenue, employers have said that they need changes to the present rules, which require loans with no tax relief on the interest to be added together. Unless the employer knows whether tax relief is due, he cannot tell whether to aggregate loans or report them separately. Employers say, quite reasonably, that they cannot be expected to intrude into what an employee has done with a loan and hence know whether tax relief is due.<br><br>
The Government accept that argument and accordingly we propose that when self-assessment starts, the requirement to aggregate such loans should be abolished. However, we will continue to allow aggregation in certain circumstances when it can help avoid complex sums. We also propose that the Inland Revenue's power to require an employer to notify the maximum balance outstanding on any loan during the tax year should continue, with minor modifications. That maintains a defence against tax avoidance by manipulation of loan balances. The Inland Revenue will issue a press release with more of the technical detail.<br><br>
I do not intend to pursue suggestions for new ways to value cheap loans, such as using the daily or monthly maximum balance on the loan, because such methods would involve computerisation costs disproportionate to the benefits currently apparent. Accordingly, the setting up costs to employers should fall by £5 million to £10 million relative to the option used in the compliance cost assessment issued on Budget day.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 522</span>
The current rules provide a right for the employee or the Revenue to elect for an alternative basis of computation. I propose to continue that safeguard for the rare cases in which the normal method may give a wayward valuation. However, the time limits for that election are complex and do not fit well with self-assessment. They therefore need to be simplified.<br><br>
It makes sense to look at the range of other claims and elections in the tax system together and to enact common rules when appropriate. Accordingly, I propose to include modest adjustments to the mechanics of beneficial loans in the third tranche of self-assessment legislation in next year's Finance Bill.<br><br>
I was impressed with what the self-assessment consultative committee said about the quality of Inland Revenue consultation, which was effective, genuine and open. I was pleased to find that the Revenue has a generally good reputation on consulting taxpayers and other organisations on changes to procedure. We have received compliments on the quality of the consultation process on self-assessment.<br><br>
The CBI has been represented on all the consultative committees and many of its concerns were met in the run up to the issue of the document in May 1994, referred to by the hon. Member for Darlington. There was some concern that all employers would have to issue nil P11Ds even when there was no benefit. That suggestion was withdrawn at an earlier stage of consultation. We are still receiving comments on the pay-as-you-earn regulations published on Budget day.<br><br>
Why did we get only 70 responses to the consultation document? One reason was that, before we issued the document, we had already met many of the employers' concerns. In addition, a response from the CBI or the Institute of Directors counted as one response, even if those organisations had consulted widely with other organisations before replying.<br><br>
I was asked how long the form might be. For approximately 90 per cent. of taxpayers, the return will be roughly the same size as the one that they now receive. The proposal is for a basic form of four to six pages, plus schedules relating to a particular taxpayer's circumstances, which will be targeted on taxpayers so that they get the schedules that they need and no others.<br><br>
I was asked how we were going to publicise the changes and how we were going to help taxpayers. I hope Opposition Members will not criticise us when we launch a campaign to alert taxpayers to the new system. We propose a major advertising campaign, aimed directly at the 9 million people who receive tax returns. We propose to use television and the national press, as well as specialist magazines. We hope to launch the campaign before the summer, and it will continue until well after self-assessment has been introduced. It will be supported by leaflets and video material.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Milburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What will the cost of the campaign be?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In due course I shall be able to give that information. We are still putting together the details of the advertising campaign with those who are doing it on our behalf. We shall make the information available in the normal way.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0799">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 523</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Presumably, there is a budget set aside. Can the Financial Secretary tell the Committee what that budget is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be as helpful as I can be. The overall budget includes not just the advertising, but the production of leaflets and other resources to help taxpayers. However, I shall endeavour to provide the Committee with such information as is available about the overall cost of the campaign.<br><br>
We shall also embark on an ambitious and comprehensive customer service programme to inform taxpayers and assist them in understanding the new system and complying with their obligations. That support will take a number of forms—direct contact through workshops and local offices, telephone helplines, and better written material made more generally available. We are conducting research into taxpayers' needs and consulting extensively on all aspects of the programme, which will help us to develop the most efficient and effective programme.<br><br>
On the issue of plain English—the answer is that we have not yet consulted. But that is because the basic content must be resolved first. I assure the Committee that the Revenue will be taking advice from the Plain English Campaign and subjecting the form to plain-English proofing. The Revenue has a good track record of winning awards for plain English.<br><br>
I was asked about monitoring, and I can certainly give the asked-for assurance that the monitoring process will apply to returns. All tax returns will be checked. Inquiries into some returns will remain a fundamental part of the new system in order to encourage people to pay their fair share of tax and to discourage evasion out of fairness to all taxpayers. The fact that the Revenue will have the right to inquire into any tax return without giving reasons will itself be an added deterrent.<br><br>
The process now, check later system will allow the Revenue to subject returns to a more detailed risk analysis in order to assist the selection of cases for detailed inquiry. The Revenue already devotes substantial resources to tackling tax evasion. There has been a 20 per cent. increase in compliance resources in the past six years. That commitment will not change under self-assessment. Some staff—for example, those who become available because of the streamlining of procedures involved in self-assessment—will be redeployed into compliance work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Milburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not just yet—I have some mid-flight refuelling to do. It is not yet clear exactly how many people will redeployed into taxpayer assistance and compliance, which is what I said before the assistance arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Milburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The crucial issue—on which the Minister has partially reassured the Committee—is monitoring. The key concern, aside from the burden on business, is what percentage of self-assessment forms will simply be nodded through. The Minister has given an assurance that they will all be checked, but we would like him to give more detail about the percentage of forms that will be subjected to detailed inquiry. I think that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 524</span>
Minister said that some would be. As well as providing the exact percentage, will the Minister tell us which specific categories will be deemed to be the most risky?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I can tell the hon. Gentleman the specific percentage that will be subjected to a particular process. All the forms will be checked. They will be checked when they arrive to ensure that the arithmetic is correct. They will then be subjected to risk analysis—previous history and so on will be examined. Some will be subjected to random checking as a deterrent—"pour encourager les autres". I am not sure that the Revenue has ever revealed what percentage will be subjected to that process—that was debated last year—and I am not sure that such information could be revealed. However, I will reflect on the hon. Gentleman's point to determine whether I can be more forthcoming without reducing the importance of a deterrent system. If the random check were infinitesimal, it might affect taxpayer behaviour; if a high percentage were subjected to it, it might have the opposite effect. The check has to be pitched at the right level. I might be able to be more helpful on reflection than I have been in my instantaneous response.<br><br>
I was asked who replied. Nearly all the representative bodies—mainly the large accountancy firms but also the larger employers, such as W.H. Smith, J. Sainsbury, some major banks and FTSE companies—responded. Quite big players were included in the 70 referred to by the hon. Gentleman. Most of the obligations referred to in the clause already exist. In response to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South, we are piloting 3,000 employees and 30 employers in Leicester from April 1995 on the whole of the new system.<br><br>
I hope that those who read <i>Hansard</i> will pick up the plea of the hon. Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson) to be invited to the England game. New subsection (4) does not introduce a new measure for providing the name and address of employees: such a provision already exists in section 15 of the Taxes Management Act 1970. I assure the hon. Gentleman that new subsection (5) does not affect cash wages on which PAYE should be operated. I listened to the scenario that he described, but it was not clear to me how many part-time workers would be receiving benefits in kind. His conjuction of events seemed unlikely.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Christmas party going over budget. There will be no change in the existing arrangements. If a party costs too much and goes above the concession of £50 per head, it is bad news because the whole amount is taxable—we confront the cliff edge. That is the position no matter how unwelcome it might be. The key point is that the cause does not change that.<br><br>
I commend the clause to the Committee. I reassure hon. Members that the Revenue recognises that employers may need help in meeting any new responsibilities that the clause and the PAYE regulations may introduce. It is doing all that it can to ensure that the right amount of assistance and guidance is available for employers when they need it. It is researching precisely what employers' needs might be and how best to meet them. The Revenue is training its staff to take part in various employer education initiatives that it is undertaking. Those programmes include some which will be in partnership with payroll and employer organisations which will get

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 525</span>
under way this summer. There should be ample time for employers to prepare for self-assessment.<br><br>
In conclusion, the hon. Member for Darlington said that the introduction of self-assessment and the dissolution of Parliament might coincide. That is one scenario. If that happens, our voters will get two forms through the letter box—the Inland Revenue self-assessment form and our election addresses. It is a moot point which they will find most exciting.</span></p>

PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CLAIMS ETC</div> <!-- title -->

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall consider the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 257, in page 111, line 28, after "to", insert "either the earlier year or".</p>
<p>No. 258, in page 111, line 29, leave out "the claim", and insert "a claim made in relation to the later year".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As you can see, Mr. Winterton, the person who is responsible for guiding Opposition Members through our proceedings has left, so there is now room for some mischief. Given the state of my voice, and given that I will probably be the only person to speak to the amendments, we should nevertheless be able to live within your strictures.<br><br>
The clause sets out the procedures for making claims on tax returns. In particular, it says that claims can be made only for amounts which are quantified. We have tabled our amendments following representations from the Institute of Taxation about the problem that it feels that that causes. The institute believes that the procedure for making claims under self-assessment is too inflexible if the claim can be made only for quantified amounts.<br><br>
In many practical situations it is possible to anticipate losses or the benefit of the carry-back of personal pension premiums before the return for a particular year has been filed, but as the amount of the claim cannot be quantified or supported by documentary evidence, such a claim will not be allowable under the clause. When a taxpayer has reasonable grounds to anticipate a highly likely reduction in tax liability, a claim should be allowed. From the Inland Revenue's point of view, such flexibility would be unlikely to lead to spurious claims, as the automatic interest and penalty provisions will apply.<br><br>
If a sole trader incurs a loss in year two, he may claim, among other reliefs, to carry back the loss against profits
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 526</span>
from year one, thereby eliminating or reducing the taxable income and the tax payable. It is generally accepted that such relief provides a valuable cashflow benefit to businesses in temporary difficulty. We all know from constituents how important such flexibility is, particularly to small businesses.<br><br>
Under present practice, it is usually possible, by agreement with the inspector of taxes, to anticipate the benefit of the carry-back in determining the amount of tax payable on year one's profits before it becomes due, rather than having to pay the tax liability in full and then seeking a refund of that tax a year later when the accounts for year two are available. That avoids hitting a company with a refundable tax charge at a time when it is evidently in difficulty. Such relief is fair and difficult to abuse—we are keen to avoid making it easier to abuse tax liability—because an overestimated claim would create a liability to interest on unpaid tax.<br><br>
We have tabled the amendments to point out the important—though, I accept, fairly technical—consequences of shifting the year of liability and the impact that that will have, in the view of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, on the cashflow problems of some businesses. That is the spirit of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment relates to one of the more obscure areas of the tax system—a regime currently operating that is, to some extent, anomalous. The present non-statutory practice of claiming relief in advance of the event that would give rise to the relief resulted from the current system of handling appeals in the collection of tax. The interest rules that apply to the existing system mean that there is an advantage in not paying tax on time, if it can be cancelled later by a claim to carry back, even though the claim cannot yet be made.<br><br>
The new system will allow the claim to be made as soon as legally possible and relief to be obtained at that point, but we do not believe that it would be right to bring in interest rules that reproduce the current regime, which, as I said a moment ago, is somewhat anomalous.<br><br>
The hon. Lady's amendment seeks to change the machinery for dealing with claims to carry back relief to earlier years. Typical examples are claims to carry back relief for payments made through personal pension plans and for trading losses. In both cases, taxpayers have the additional flexibility of being able to use the relief in an earlier year as well as in the year in which the payment was made or the loss accrued. The amendment would allow taxpayers to claim an amount that they have not quantified. That would not fit with the general principle of self-assessment, which aims to arrive at a quantified tax bill within the normal timetable for each year and by reference to the tax events of that tax year.<br><br>
I can give some assurance about the way in which such claims will be dealt with. Subsection (1A) introduces the sensible and necessary requirement in a self-assessment system—that the claim must be in a specified amount. It would be difficult to arrive at the amount of relief due without that figure. The same is true of income and gains to be included in the return. They, too, must be quantified so that the taxpayer can arrive at the amount of tax due.<br><br>
In both cases, however, there will be times when, with the best will in the world, the final figures are simply not available. In such cases, whether they are in relation to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0801">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 527</span>
income or gains or claims to relief, the taxpayer will be able to submit his best estimate of the figure that should be included. There is nothing new about that and I say to the hon. Lady that, provided that taxpayers take due care in making their estimate, relief can be given. When the final figures are available, the taxpayer can then adjust the amount of relief that has been claimed.<br><br>
The Revenue is discussing those matters with representative organisations and will be issuing guidance on the use of estimated figures in returns. That guidance will include reference to the use of estimates in claims to reliefs. As for the specific point, people can make their claim at the earliest opportunity and, if necessary, use their best estimate of the relief that is available. There is no need to change the legislation as proposed in the amendment.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 257 and 258 would change the way in which we propose to deal with the carry back of reliefs, by making earlier self-assessments contingent on later events. At present, that does not matter, but under the new system the amounts assessed for each year should be capable of being finally determined by 31 January following the tax year. That then determines the tax payable for the year.<br><br>
As drafted, subsection (4) deals with carry back of relief by making it a claim of the year in which the relief arises. It will continue to offer taxpayers flexibility in their use of such reliefs and it will change neither the amount of relief that is available nor its tax effect. In addition, it will not change the time at which such claims can be made.<br><br>
However, a self-assessment, unlike a current assessment, will not be able to be contingent on later events. In practical terms, that means that there will no longer be an incentive to delay payment of tax due at the payment date in the expectation that a claim will be made later. The tax shown by the self-assessment will remain the correct amount payable, and hence be acknowledged as such by both the taxpayer and the Revenue. That will give taxpayers greater certainty, and help to streamline the system.<br><br>
The changes proposed in the amendments would reinstate some of the worst features of the present system, which is why I cannot accept them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Financial Secretary's assurances, and especially as he is going to consult on the implementation of this section I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 232, in page 112, line 5, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"() In subsection (4) of that section, there shall be inserted at the beginning the words 'Subject to subsection (4A) below',</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>() After subsection (4) of that section there shall be inserted the following subsection—

<li>'(4A) Subsection (4) above shall not apply where—</li>
<ol>
<li>(a) the company is wholly exempt from corporation tax or is only not so exempt in respect of trading income; and</li>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 528</span>
The amendment ensures that exempt companies, which include charities and some friendly societies, can claim payment of tax credits on dividends without making a return. Under the self-assessment rules, all companies that can claim payment of tax credits must make their claims in the return. Exempt companies usually have no tax liability, and there is no need for them to complete a return. We do not want to oblige exempt companies to make a return simply to claim payment of tax credits or to experience the delay in obtaining payment that that would involve. The amendment will relieve exempt companies, especially charities, from the unnecessary burden of making a return, and it will make it easier for them to obtain early payment of tax within their accounting period.</span></p>

SELF-ASSESSMENT ETC: TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 233, in page 293, line 37, leave out from "and" to end of line 44 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"the aggregate of the following, namely—
<ol>
<li>so much of any income tax charged at a higher rate on any income—
<ol>
<li>from which tax has been deducted otherwise than under section 203 of the Taxes Act 1988, or</li>
<li>from or on which income tax is treated as having been deducted or paid,</li></ol>
as is attributable to the difference between that rate and the basic rate; and</li>
<li>so much of any income tax charged at a higher rate on any income chargeable under Schedule F as is attributable to the difference between that rate and the lower rate.".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
This is a technical amendment, and it involves the rules relating to payments on account for 1996–97. For that year only, higher rate tax in respect of any income that has had tax deducted at source would not be collectable on payments on account. It was always intended that that should apply to dividends, which carry a tax credit that is worked out in terms of the lower rate of tax. The amendment will give effect to that intention. I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Schedule 21, as amended, agreed to.</i></p>
<p>Further consideration adjourned.—<i>[Mr. Conway.]</i></p>
<p><i>Adjourned accordingly at sixteen minutes to One o'clock till this day at half-past Four o'clock.</i></p>
