<p>participation schemes. The Government welcome the growth of part-time work. It is one of the range of flexible working practices that can be of benefit both to employers and employees in promoting business efficiency and helping to reconcile work and other responsibilities. Part-time working helps employers match staffing to the level of demand and reduces overheads. It allows employees to fit work around other commitments, and enables some people to work who would otherwise be unable to do so. Part-time work is good for the economy and convenient for both employers and employees.</p>
<p>Approximately 6.8 million people work part time, of whom approximately 84 per cent, are women. It is interesting that only 11 per cent, of part-time workers are working part time because they were unable to find full-time work. If our employment structure is changing we must ensure that that is reflected in the legislative framework.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0880">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 661</span>
<p>I now turn to the five employee financial participation schemes, to explain how they ought to interface with the changing employment structure. The intention behind all those schemes is to encourage and motivate everyone whose work makes a business prosper and grow. That is why we encourage businesses to establish schemes by allowing them tax relief on their set-up costs, and why we give tax reliefs to employees and directors who participate in them. The schemes break down the barriers between employees and employers; they build an identity of interest between those who own the businesses and those who work in them; they improve the profitability of the nation's businesses; and, as a result, they benefit all shareholders, employees and customers.</p>
<p>The main cost of the schemes falls, quite properly, on those who chiefly benefit from them: the companies and businesses themselves. It is the shareholders or the partners who bear the major burden, not the customer or taxpayer.</p>
<p>I shall describe briefly the five schemes that are covered by the new clause. Approved profit-sharing schemes enable companies to give employees shares free, and free from income tax. The company sets up a trust and gives it money—typically from profits—to buy the company's shares. The trustees then allocate the shares to individual employees who must agree to leave them in the trust for a minimum of two years. After five years, employees can take their shares out of the trust completely free of income tax. In 1992–93 some 740,000 employees received free share allocations worth £310 million. A wide range of companies have profit-sharing schemes—Sainsburys is just one example.</p>
<p>Under approved savings-related share option schemes, employees agree to save money through the save-as-you-earn scheme and are granted options to buy shares in their employing company with the money saved. They contract to save a specific sum of between £10 and £250 a month over a five-year period and at the end of the term their savings earn a tax-free bonus. If they wish, employees may leave their savings for a further two years to earn a larger tax-free bonus. When the bonus date is reached, employees can choose to exercise their options using the tax-free proceeds of the savings contract or they may take the whole sum in cash. In 1992–93, some 590,000 employees were granted options over shares worth £1.88 billion. Again, a wide range of companies has such schemes—Cadbury Schweppes is one.</p>
<p>The third scheme is the registered profit-related pay scheme, under which tax relief is given on that part of pay which varies with changes in the profits of the business for which the employee works. PRP is tax free up to a limit of the lower of 20 per cent, of pay or £4,000. The scheme must be registered with the Inland Revenue before its start date and it must specify how the total sum to be distributed as PRP is to be calculated. It must also ensure that at least 80 per cent, of the employees in the business participate in the scheme. We discussed PRP at length last week. Some 2 million people in 8,000 companies are covered by PRP schemes.</p>
<p>Fourthly, qualifying employee share ownership trusts—ESOTs—are trusts which conform to statutory rules and are set up for the benefit of a company's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 662</span>
employees to provide them with easy access to shares in the company. The trusts acquire shares and distribute them to employees, either directly or through an approved profit-sharing scheme. The tax relief available includes corporation tax relief for a company's payments to the trustees and capital gains tax roll-over relief on certain conditions for people who dispose of their shares to a qualifying ESOT Those four schemes cover some 3.5 million people, so the Committee will understand that new clause 5 has wide application.</p>
<p>I come finally to the fifth scheme. Under approved executive or discretionary share option schemes, selected employees are granted options to buy shares at a price fixed by reference to the market value of the shares at the date on which the option is granted. There are limits on the size of options that can be granted. There are limits on the size of options that can be granted to an employee— the value of the shares held at the date on which any option is granted must not exceed four times the amount of the employee's pay or £100,000, whichever is the greater. Executives must hold their options for at least three years before they can exercise them free of an income tax charge and at least three years must elapse between any tax-relieved exercise. If executives then sell the shares, capital gains tax is payable at 40 per cent., subject to the usual rules, on the difference between the sale and the option price. In 1992–93 some 80,000 employees and executives were granted options over shares worth £1.6 billion.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, the clause is designed to open those schemes fully to part-time workers. In introducing it, we have also had very much in mind the decision of the House of Lords last year in the case of Right <i>v.</i> the Secretary of State for Employment ex parte the Equal Opportunities Commission and another. It is appropriate that we are having this debate on the day after the International Women's day. The decision relates to the way in which European equal pay and equal treatment law affects the treatment of part-timers under United Kingdom legislation.</p>
<p>Current tax legislation relating to the schemes either requires or permits an employer to exclude part-time workers, as defined by reference to the number of hours worked, from participation in the schemes. The new clause removes those provisions and is designed to have the effect that part-time workers must be treated in exactly the same way as full-time workers in each scheme.</p>
<p>When we were planning the legislation, we understood that to treat part-time workers fairly and in accordance with the House of Lords' decision it was necessary to treat all part-time workers alike, whether employees or directors. That is why the new clause removes restrictions on the participation of part-time directors in the schemes. Since the clause was published, we have reconsidered that in the light of representations from the Association of British Insurers.</p>
<p>We accept that a there is a distinction to be drawn in this context between part-time directors and part-time employees. The role of non-executive directors is to stand a little apart from the day-to-day commercial issues of the company and to bring to that company a measure of independent judgment. They cannot easily do that if their personal interests are too closely tied to the company and its share price.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0881">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 663</span>
<p>We therefore thought it right to stand back and reconsider the position of part-time directors. After doing so, we are satisfied that, within the spirit of the House of Lords' decision, we can properly take part-time directors, as distinct from part-time employees, out of the new clause altogether. As I have already announced in reply to a question, we propose to bring forward on Report, amendments which will ensure that the provisions in the new clause about the inclusion of part-time workers in all those employee financial participation schemes will apply only to part-time employees and not to part-time directors. Part-time directors will continue to be barred from participation in approved executive option schemes.</p>
<p>I must stress that, in terms of the executive option scheme, the amendment will apply only to part-time directors. We have no plans to exclude part-employees from executive schemes. There can be no reason of principle to discriminate against part-time employees as between one scheme and another. Executive share option schemes are already discretionary in the sense that employees can choose which employees, or groups of employees, to include in them and companies must be left to make their own judgments about where shareholders' interests lie.</p>
<p>I believe that we have now reached the right position in relation to part-time directors and that the new clause, when the necessary amendments have been introduced on Report, will be seen by Members on both sides of the House to be a satisfactory resolution which avoids discrimination and yet retains a sensible balance.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I shall have cause to be critical of the Government over the operation of executive share options and over their proposal in the new clause to extend tax breaks on executive share options to part-time directors, I shall deal with those issues later. I shall start by saying that there is much in the principle of the new clause, specifically the extension to part-time workers of rights and opportunities currently available only to full-time workers, that Opposition Members applaud, leaving aside the merits or otherwise of the particular schemes involved. The first scheme mentioned by the Financial Secretary was the profit-sharing scheme allowing benefit to accrue after people have retained shares in the company for five years. That scheme was initiated by a Labour Government as part of our commitment fully to involve employees in their companies. It is right that those opportunities should be extended to part-time workers.<br><br>
Labour Members have long been arguing that part-time workers should enjoy the rights and statutory protection enjoyed by full timers. We welcome any move in that direction even if, as with the measure before us, it results from the House of Lords' ruling and EC directives, rather than springing spontaneously from Government good sense or good will. To listen to the Financial Secretary, one would think that the Government are volunteering the provision out of the goodness of their heart and their commitment to the interests of part-time workers. But we know that, in practice, the concessions have been extracted from them one painful concession after another. The Government have been dragged unwillingly, screaming and hollering, while resisting European Community interference and the damage that that would do to the flexibility of the labour market. We have heard
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 664</span>
those arguments so often from Conservative Members that they cannot now turn round and try to con us and the public into believing that they are acting from a commitment to the good of part-time workers. However, we welcome any steps in that direction, no matter how forced they were.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why did the last Labour Government confine their scheme to full-time employees?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have made a great deal of progress since then as the number of part-time workers has increased dramatically. Unlike the Conservative party, the Labour party has kept abreast of the times and is addressing the needs of the modem labour market in a way that is resisted by Conservative Members.<br><br>
I want to raise a point that was brought to my attention by the Electricity Association, and which was also referred to in an article in the <i>Financial Times</i> on 25 February. The association draws attention to the implication of including part-time workers in profit-related pay schemes, as subsection (1) of the new clause provides. Some part-time workers may not actually derive any tax benefit from such a scheme, which may create difficulties considering the present Inland Revenue rules, to which the Financial Secretary referred. For approved schemes, 80 per cent, of eligible employees must be included. If I give the Committee an example, we shall see how problems may arise.<br><br>
Let us consider two part-time workers, both earning £100 a week, one of whom pays tax at 25 per cent, and another who does not pay tax. If their employer were to devise a profit-related pay scheme, which cut pay to £80 a week, but removed income tax liability, the first worker would be £5 a week better off—he would take home £80 a week compared with the £75 post-tax income he would have received—whereas the second worker would be £20 a week worse off and would have no interest in the scheme.<br><br>
The Electricity Association points out that, at present, its members calculate what they call—appropriately for the Electricity Association—a safe cut-off point for its schemes, above which it is worth employees taking part. In its letter to the Chief Secretary dated 28 February, it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"In one electricity company, who is currently looking at setting up such a scheme for their retail business, this cut-off point is estimated at 20 hours per week. Under the new rules therefore, as just over 20 per cent, of their retail employees work less than 20 hours per week and would thus not benefit from PRP the 80 per cent, rule for setting up a scheme would most likely be impossible to meet.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>If employers are to be prevented from excluding part-timers from access to schemes, some other corresponding adjustments are therefore required to the PRP rules. One possibility is to reduce the 80 per cent. Another option could be that if individuals are confident that they are not going to benefit from PRP, then they would be allowed voluntarily, rather than compulsorily, to make themselves ineligible for the scheme and thus only those who stand to benefit from PRP would be subject to the 80 per cent, rule."</p></blockquote>
Where there is a profit-related pay scheme, all employees should be able to benefit. That would reflect the spirit and, indeed, the letter of the House of Lords ruling and the principle of equity that underpins it. I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would tell the Committee how the Government envisage that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0882">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 665</span>
problem will be resolved. It would be bizarre and unfair if the result of attempting to remove one indefensible barrier between full-time and part-time workers were its replacement with an equally indefensible barrier between some part-time workers and others. Bearing in mind that those who stand to gain least from existing schemes are disproportionately likely to be women, unless the Government adopt the principle that I have advocated they will substitute one form of unfairness for another and may still fall foul of House of Lords decisions and EC directives. That should be considered in the interests of equity for the workers and in the interests of practicality for companies operating the schemes.<br><br>
The <i>Financial Times</i> article of 25 February drew attention to the position of the clothing retailer River Island, whose finance director Colin Bayley said that 50 per cent, of its work force of 5,000 were part time, and most of them worked only on Saturdays and did not pay tax. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"If the amendment stands as it is there will be little point in attempting to get 80 per cent, approval for another scheme next year."</p></blockquote>
There is a problem and we look forward to hearing the Financial Secretary's explanation of how the Government intend to resolve it.<br><br>
There are good reasons why it is wrong for the Government to propose the extension of executive share options to part-time directors, as they do in subsection (3). The supplement on good practice in the Cadbury committee report says on page 9, paragraph 5:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Committee regards it as good practice for non-executive directors not to participate in share option schemes and for their service as non-executive directors not to be pensionable by the company in order to safeguard their independent position".</p></blockquote>
That is fundamental to the difference in responsibilities between part-time and full-time directors. How did the Government come to ignore such an important recommendation from the Cadbury committee in drawing up the new clause?<br><br>
There is an even more fundamental reason why the public view the extension of tax breaks on share options to part-time directors as wrong. To put it crudely, at a time when the public want the Government to close down the trough of abuse which has so tarnished the privatised utilities, the provision makes that trough bigger.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure when the hon. Gentleman wrote his speech, but he will have understood from what I said that we are not planning to introduce that provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Winterton, I am sure that you will be the first to correct me if I am wrong, but we are debating the new clause, in which the Government invite us to insert into the law the opportunity to extend tax breaks on executive share options to part-time directors. Whatever the Financial Secretary says that the Government may do on Report, we have not seen the words in black and white. The public would not have much confidence in us if we were prepared to take on trust the Government's words, which, until now, have never been matched by actions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to conceal his embarrassment at reading out a speech which he wrote some time ago. He referred to the parliamentary
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 666</span>
answer in which the Government said that they were not proceeding with the measure. He should throw away three pages of his speech, which are now wholly irrelevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that my speech is a good deal more relevant to the public, who are angry about the abuses which the Government have tolerated, than the speech that was read out by the Financial Secretary a few minutes ago. I shall have more to say in a moment about the parliamentary question and the leaks to the press which preceded it.<br><br>
The Government are now desperately trying to back pedal and cobble together something which might appear to tackle wholly unacceptable abuses, but their actions are all down to the Association of British Insurers. It is not the Prime Minister—who was forced at Question Time by the Leader of the Opposition to concede that such abuses are distasteful—or public and parliamentary pressure which have forced the Government to think again, it is the Association of British Insurers. The Labour party is saying that the Government must take action now, not simply on the extension of tax breaks to part-time directors—which is in the new clause—but on the raft of abuses and the loopholes which are exploited through the tax breaks on executive share options tolerated by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman is overcome by his own rhetoric, we should consider whether the abuse really is so terrible. Suppose that someone who has retired is asked by his firm to come back to help it for three or four days a week, and he agrees to do so. Part of his package might involve the terms that we have discussed. Would that be a terrible abuse? Could one say that there were snouts in the trough? Or would it be encouraging something that is thoroughly sensible?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That reveals the problem. It shows why Opposition Members are right to have so little confidence in the Government's statement that they will do something about the matter on Report. That is like the Prime Minister saying that he will do something after the Greenbury report. I do not think that Conservative Members realise how high public feeling is running. The public are determined that action should be taken to prevent abuse.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bournemouth, West Mr. Butterfill asked whether the position was so wrong in the case of part-time directors. It is. I shall explain one aspect of the problem, which has not yet received the attention that it deserves. Given the extension in the clause of tax breaks to part-time directors, it will be possible for those directors to belong to more than one approved executive share option scheme. In that way they might end up with greater benefits from those schemes than do full-time directors. For example, a person with part-time directorships in two companies could take advantage of £200,000 in approved share options. The benefit would be that, instead of being taxed on the exercise of the option, as occurs at present, they would be taxed, if at all, only on the disposal of the shares.<br><br>
When we follow the example through, we can see how the benefits will accrue. If there were a rise in the value of the shares between the granting of the options and their exercise of £30,000, the person involved would, at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0883">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 667</span>
present, on the 40 per cent, tax rate, pay income tax of £12,000. Under the rules in the clause, he will not pay any tax on exercise, thereby obtaining the benefit of the return on the deferred taxation. When he sells the shares he will, under the proposed rules, be taxed on the capital gain, which is at the rate of 40 per cent. Apologists for the Government have made a great deal of that rate, which is the same at that of income tax. However, it does not have the same effect in terms of the amount of tax that is paid.<br><br>
The apologists do not say that the actual tax paid will be considerably less than the amount that would have been levied under income tax. It will be less for three reasons. The first reason is the additional allowance against capital gains tax of £6,000, which will be deducted. Secondly, the beneficiaries can double the benefits involved by bringing their spouses' allowance into play. Thirdly, the beneficiaries will be entitled to relief for inflation during the period that they held the shares.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the annual exemption will apply only if the person involved had no other capital gains for the year in question. He might use them up on other capital gains. The hon. Gentleman's argument is therefore quite illogical. Secondly, he was stretching the point to suggest that a spouse's allowance could be involved. The person in question would have to hold the shares jointly with his spouse for her to be able to use her allowance. Her allowance is not readily transferrable. The shares would have to be her own. I do not see how the spouse could be included in an executive share option scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman shows how well qualified he is to advise people about how they could best exploit the proposed rules to their advantage. Again, Conservative Members are mistaking the public's mood if they think that an allowance for £6,000 on capital gains is neither here nor there. That is an awful lot more money than many people in this country earn. That is the whole point—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman suggested that I am qualified to advise people. I am not qualified. I am not a chartered accountant. I do not advise anyone on such matters. I am a humble chartered surveyor, but I take an interest in such matters.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry the hon. Gentleman is not as well qualified as I thought.<br><br>
As well as the benefits that I have just mentioned, people can also take advantage of the fact that capital gains tax liabilities are easier to shelter from tax than are income tax liabilities. No tax at all is paid if the proceeds are invested in an enterprise investment scheme or in a venture capital trust—schemes that we have already debated at length.<br><br>
Under the scheme, part-time directors enjoy a multiple benefit that is wrong in principle, would be exploited in practice and is utterly insensitive to public opinion. The public are sick and tired of the outrageous remuneration packages available to some people, especially those who exploit the monopolistic position of the privatised utilities. The Government either anticipated the multiple benefits that I have described when they drew up the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 668</span>
clause, in which case they misled the public about their intentions, or the consequences are wholly unintended, in which case the Government have been highly incompetent. I look forward to hearing in the Financial Secretary's report to which charge he pleads guilty— misleading the public or incompetence.<br><br>
Our amendment (b) would ensure that share option schemes other than those that are savings related would not be available to part-time directors. If the Financial Secretary now accepts the logic of our argument and the campaign that we have waged for so many months on the issue, why not accept the amendment and ensure that those schemes could apply only to part-time and full-time employees and full-time and not part-time directors? That would curtail the abuse. Given the Financial Secretary's claims that he accepts that logic, why not accept the amendment?<br><br>
I turn to how the Government announced—or hinted— that they would do something about the problem. We have not seen the Government's proposals—they comprise hints and intentions, nothing in black and white. I hope that, in his reply, the Financial Secretary will tell the Committee how the Government propose to tackle the abuse, instead of inviting us to take them on trust. Given the Government's record on the matter, there is nothing that one can take on trust.<br><br>
It was an insult to the Committee, to the public and to you, Mr. Winterton, that the first we heard about the Government's proposal to table amendments on the subject was in last weekend's newspapers. The parliamentary answer on Tuesday, to which the Financial Secretary referred, again acknowledged that some action would be taken, but no amendments were tabled. Why could not the amendments have been tabled so that they could have been considered with the new clause today? That would have been proper.<br><br>
On the run-of-the-mill issues before the Committee, a sort of courtesy operates whereby the Opposition are given notice—sometimes not much notice, but welcome none the less—of Government proposals to change the Bill. If reflects badly on Ministers that, on this occasion, they departed from that practice and allowed their intentions to be leaked to the press first—hinting that they were considering a huge change in approach and running scared in the face of public opinion, but unable to state in black and white what changes they were proposing. They may do well to reflect that it might not be long before the boot is on the other foot.<br><br>
Even when they announced in the parliamentary answer their intention to take action, they did not say what that would be. Even now, they are unable to say. That is unacceptable and reflects the fact that the Government are deeply split on the subject of abuse of executive share options and excessive remuneration packages for privatised utilities. Some Conservative Members stick to the line that they previously put forward, which is that this matter should be left to the play of the free market and that it is for boards of directors and shareholders to decide, within the existing rules, what is in the company's interests. That school of thought still holds powerful sway among Conservative Members.<br><br>
There are others who, forced by Labour's campaign and the strength of public feeling on this issue, acknowledge that something must be done. Their problem
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0884">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 669</span>
is that they cannot decide what to do. That is why they procrastinate and say "We shall deal with that matter on Report. We shall do something after the Greenbury report." They wish and hope that the whole mess, which is of their creation, would simply go away.<br><br>
The British public are fed up with the Government's excuses and double standards on share options, on the excesses of the privatised utilities and on so many other matters. The public do not want to hear more words from Conservative Members; they want to see some action. It is time that the Government took the action that Labour party has been advocating for a long time.<br><br>
First, that would mean opening up the regulatory process for water, electricity, gas and telecommunications, with public hearings so that the public, in particular customers, can make their voices heard. Members of the public would have the opportunity to question the privatised utilities in their services to the public, on profits and on their boardroom practices, to ensure that, before prices are set, customers get a fair deal.<br><br>
Secondly, the industry regulators should be given wider powers to cut prices, to take account of boardroom excesses and remuneration packages when prices are set.<br><br>
Thirdly, we have consistently advocated the taxing of executive share options as income. That would be fair and proper. I was struck by the figures quoted by the Financial Secretary on the number of people who were members of such schemes. He said that 3.5 million people were benefiting from the first four schemes that he listed, whereas, 80,000 people were benefiting from the approved executive share option schemes. That shows what a minority pursuit executive share options are, but that pursuit is cornering a huge share of the resources that are being distributed. It is right that such options should be taxed as income.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</span></span><i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. David Shaw—a short intervention please.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall ask one simple question. If the Labour party has been arguing for so long against share options, can the hon. Gentleman explain why, under the chambers' listing for the leader of the Opposition, the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), it says that his law chambers in 11, King's Bench walk specialise in employment law and share options? They specialise in ensuring that directors and executives have share options.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall continue with what I was saying.<br><br>
As well as opening up the regulatory process, giving the regulator the power to cut prices and taxing executive share options as income, the Government should now move to ensure that, through election, there is an independent voice on remuneration committees and they should strengthen the accountability of boards to shareholders on such matters. They should require the full disclosure of the total pay and benefit packages given to each member of boards of directors and they should strengthen the power of shareholders by requiring that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 670</span>
they must give specific approval to the remuneration packages that are available to directors and top executives and ensure that those are properly related to company performance.<br><br>
We have good evidence—the most recent, from last week, from the study completed by Warwick and Oxford universities—showing that, at the moment, there is no relationship between company performance and the granting of executive share options. The argument that such packages tie executives into their companies' performance, and are, therefore, of benefit to the wider economy, falls flat when exposed to proper empirical scrutiny.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a small point, if a company's performance is no good, and the share price falls, the director receives no benefit whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That precisely makes the point: if it was properly being tied to performance they would suffer a disbenefit if the company did badly. At present they are given entirely a one-way bet which relates not so much to their individual performance as directors, or to their company's performance, but to general movements in the market, especially in the sector of which their company is a member. These packages should be subject to more effective shareholder scrutiny to ensure a relationship with performance.<br><br>
New clause 5 fails utterly to take the necessary action to end abuse. We have no confidence that what the Government have promised on Report will be any better. It is time that Conservative Members got the message: they must act, and act now, to stop there being one rule for the very few and another for everyone else. They are the party of indefensible privilege and excess, and it is time that they began listening to the party of the people on these Benches and put matters right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The striking thing about that contribution from the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith) is that it shows that nothing has changed. The Labour party claims to have changed, but it has not. A reading of the report of the Standing Committee proceedings on the Finance Bill in 1984, when these changes to share options were introduced, shows the same bile, prejudice and discrimination against the people who create the wealth in British society, and the profits—a dirty word to the Labour party—out of which most investment comes. What they do not understand—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I have only just started my speech.<br><br>
Labour Members do not understand that the main source of investment in the United Kingdom is not money that is raised on the stock exchange, or borrowed from banks, but retained profits. The critical element for a company is how much profit it is able to retain in the company for reinvestment.<br><br>
Who is best placed to influence the level of retained profits? Whether the hon. Member for Oxford, East likes it or not, it is the board of directors. In my view, it is right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0885">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 671</span>
that directors have incentives to encourage them to increase the company's profits and the retained profits, because these are the main source of investment and job creation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I have just started my speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We want an orderly debate. It will be watched elsewhere. Members of the Committee should set an example. The subject is important, so perhaps we can give the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) the same hearing as we gave the hon. Member for Oxford, East.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the new clause. I believe that it is right in principle to extend the five schemes to part-time workers, because whether or not it happened as a result of a decision by the House of Lords, it seems the proper thing to do.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Oxford, East mentioned the profit-related pay scheme. I share his concern. My amendment (e) would attempt to tackle the problem that he described.<br><br>
It has been pointed out to me that to get a profit-related pay scheme off the ground, it is necessary to have 80 per cent, of the work force behind the idea. That must be done annually, and it is clear that if part-time employees are included, those who do not pay income tax will have no interest in a PRP scheme; therefore it will not get off the ground. In fact, some existing schemes might be prejudiced.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
The article in the <i>Financial Times</i> to which the hon. Member for Oxford, East referred dealt specifically with retailers, who employ many part-time workers. A legitimate point has been raised and my amendment is an attempt to deal with it. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will respond to the point at the end of the debate.<br><br>
I shall now return to the question of executive share option schemes because I do not want to avoid answering questions from Opposition Members. I readily acknowledge the concern felt about some executive share options that have been granted recently to directors in the regulated private utilities. I agree with the hon. Member for Oxford, East that the public do not like what is going on. They see those companies as not being subject to the fierce competition in which other companies—for example, manufacturing or service industry companies— are engaged. The public's concern is entirely legitimate.<br><br>
The question is what is the best way to tackle that? Is it through company law or through tax law? I believe that we must give the matter more consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Hoon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ashfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Executive share option schemes clearly flow from an individual being in employment. In that sense, the benefit that accrues to an employee is no different from any other benefit in kind. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one approach would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 672</span>
be to tax the schemes as benefits in kind are taxed, which is that they are subject to income tax, not capital gains tax?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, that would be one possible approach. Another would be to examine the parameters of the scheme because, as my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary explained, there are limits—four times the salary or £100,000, whichever is the greater sum. The fact is that if one's salary is very large—say, £470,000 which is by no means unheard of—four times that is almost £2 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Brilliant!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should employ me as an accountant.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary should consider imposing an additional ceiling given that, as the hon. Gentleman said, someone earning almost £500,000 is, in theory, entitled to £2 million-worth of share options. Therefore examining the parameters of the scheme is a possibility.<br><br>
I do not agree that the taxable basis should be changed because, as I explained earlier, key personnel should have an incentive to create more wealth and to stay with the company. We are part of an international market, and the hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon) knows that as well as anyone. The chief executive of British Gas did not have to take that job—he is an outstanding individual and could have worked in America or in another part of Europe. We must consider the whole package to determine whether it is attractive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Legg <span class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, South-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the reasons why the schemes should be subject to capital gains tax is that directors are acquiring capital assets? If income tax is immediately imposed, that would encourage them to dispose of those shares rather than to hold them and therefore have an increased interest in the well being of the company.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. When the scheme was introduced in 1984, I strongly supported it. I do not accept that it has been successful; generally speaking, it has been a success. The difficulty is that, at the margin, there have been cases of abuse—I am the first to recognise that—and we must consider how we are to address public concern about the issue. I have suggested one way—that we consider the tax aspects. There are other ways of tackling the problem which have nothing to do with taxation and are therefore nothing to do with this debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed that the Financial Secretary has advanced this proposal as a boon to part-time workers. The only part-time workers who will benefit are those with whom the clause deals— part-time directors. The right hon. Gentleman asks us to believe that, on Report, the Government will set up a system to deal with abuses. We then heard the energetic and enthusiastic speeches from Conservative Members who support the clause as it is drafted. I hold out no hope of the Government doing anything about the abuses.<br><br>
It is outrageous and grotesque that it should be a Treasury Minister who stands up and speaks in support of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0886">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 673</span>
the principle of helping part-time workers. Why do not Employment Ministers show that same energy? Why is it that, for the past 15 years, employment legislation has discriminated against part-time workers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Representing as I do—and perhaps the hon. Gentleman does also—a constituency where there has been a vast increase in part-time work in the past 15 years, it is clear to me that the Government have done everything possible to encourage more people, especially mothers, to return to part-time work and that such people are making ever-greater contributions to the economy. It is right that Treasury Ministers should reinforce that message.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sutcliffe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have seen benefits cut and a whole range of measures introduced that discriminate against part-time workers. The increase in part-time working has produced low pay. If the Government are considering a package for part-time workers, I suggest that the Financial Secretary asks himself who will benefit from the measure. What about those part-time workers who are on low pay? There is a need for the Government to have vision and to look for a package that will reflect the changing employment conditions in the coming years.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East said, this measure was trumpeted as an attempt to prevent abuses, yet we have heard nothing this morning that will do so—just a promise that something might happen on Report. Members of the public know that the Government have had to make an embarassing U-turn and the Financial Secretary is putting a brave face on it. People outside want action; they know that it was the Labour party, through its leader, which pushed the Prime Minister into announcing that legislation would be introduced.<br><br>
I do not want to detain the Committee too long, but I hope that the Minister will come clean and admit that it was pressure from the public and from the Labour party that forced the changes that will, apparently, be introduced at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Legg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a wide-ranging debate and I should like to bring the Committee back to the original reason for Government new clause 5. As my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said, the clause was introduced as a result of the House of Lords judgment requiring this country to comply with European law in respect of benefits for part-time workers. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield pointed out, that judgment overthrew provisions in the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978, which was introduced by a Labour Government, and in which distinctions were made between part-time and full-time workers.<br><br>
As a result of the desire to comply with European law, the new clause was introduced but, as so often happens when we are required to comply with European law, problems have arisen. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield has highlighted in his amendment, one of those problems relates to profit-related pay. As most members of the Committee know and as my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary explained in his speech, there is a test for applying profit-related pay in a company—consent must be given by 80 per cent, of employees, which category will be extended to include part-time workers.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 674</span>
There is a danger that many part-time workers will not see the point of participating in a profit-related pay scheme, because they do not currently earn sufficient income to use up all of their tax allowances. That is especially true in the catering, hotel and retail industries—for example, in the retail industry, many part-time workers work only on Saturday.<br><br>
All of those employees will now be brought within the category of those who will be required to consent to setting up a profit-related pay scheme. There is a consensus in the Committee in support of profit-related pay schemes, which have been very successful; indeed, they have enhanced this country's entrepreneurial success. Therefore, I hope that my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will be able to reconsider the 80 per cent. test. He has said that he will table amendments on Report, so he may consider it appropriate to introduce a lower level of test to make sure that profit-related pay schemes can continue to operate in a full range of businesses.<br><br>
With regard to the other problem produced by the European requirements, the Government have clearly sought to get rid of all distinctions between full-time and part-time employees. That intention has thrown up the issue of whether non-executive directors should be eligible for share options. The Government's previous position—which I think is right—is that they should not be eligible. The change that has been required of the Government has led to the clause being tabled. Having considered the matter, the Government have decided to return to their original position of not allowing part-time non-executive directors to participate in share option schemes. I am sure that the representations made by the Association of British Insurers, to which my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary referred, are right. It is inappropriate for non-executive directors to have such benefits because as they are not running the company, they do not need that incentive. It would also not be good for the judgment of non-executive directors to know that it was in their interests for the share price to reach a certain level at a certain time in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has much experience in the subject. No doubt he is aware of the Cadbury committee in corporate governance which, with the full support of the stock exchange, clearly recommends that non-executive directors should not have share options because that would tie them into the company's management structure, of which they should be independent. My hon. Friend may well want to comment on the fact that one Labour Member of Parliament—the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape)—is a non-executive director who has been given share options by a privatised bus company. It strikes me as odd that the Labour party has no interest in corporate governance and has allowed that to happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Legg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention. I must admit that I am not familiar with the details of the case, so I cannot comment on it, but I know that several Labour Members of Parliament are active in that sphere. On Tuesday, one of our hon. Friends drew the attention of the House to the fact that the hon. Member for Leicester, West (Mr. Janner) is on the remuneration committee of Ladbroke. Labour Members of Parliament
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0887">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 675</span>
clearly have some involvement and knowledge of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I can get the hon. Gentleman back to the substance of the argument and away from personal slurs I shall be doing the Committee a service. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) will let his hon. Friend for Milton Keynes, Southwest (Mr. Legg) hear what I am saying.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West was present when I referred to the Cadbury committee and its supplementary recommendations stating that it was inappropriate to extend share options to non-executive, part-time directors. Does not he share my feeling that it is extraordinary that the Government included the provision in the clause, knowing from all the advice and resources available to them that Cadbury would make those evidently sensible recommendations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Legg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I made my position absolutely clear earlier in my speech. The Government are seeking through the new clause to comply with European law. The hon. Member for Oxford, East has shown the same enthusiasm to comply with European law. However, in seeking to comply with European law, the Government have come up against a problem which my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has said that he will deal with on Report. I shall be interested to hear what arguments the hon. Gentleman will advance then. All hon. Members know that if we are to escape from the provisions of European law on part-time workers and part-time directors, the Government must be able to give an objective justification of its proposals rather than fall foul of European law once again. I shall be interested to hear whether my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has given any consideration yet to that objective justification, which we may need to put forward if part-time non-executive directors challenge the provisions—which members on both sides of the Committee seem to want to pass—under European law.<br><br>
I remind my right hon. Friend that there are several women who are part-time non-executive directors. Lady Howe is a part-time non-executive director of Kingfisher, Legal and General and United Biscuits. She is also a former chairman of the Equal Opportunities Commission and we all know that her husband is a stong supporter of European integration. If my right hon. Friend is successful in excluding part-time directors from the provisions, some individuals may seek to take the matter to the European court. I shall be interested to hear what justification the Government might put forward.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman like to comment on other women non-executive directors such as the wife of Lord Archer who, as we understand it, used her position as a non-executive director of a television company to benefit her husband and their friends?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Legg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady. Many women are non-executive directors. The hon. Lady seems to be arguing against the case that her hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East has made for equality.<br><br>
The debate has raised many important issues relating to the fact that we are seeking to comply with European law
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 676</span>
and the impact that those laws are having on our share incentive arrangements. I look forward to hearing the strong arguments of my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary when he sums up the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall preface my remarks by saying that I am a strong supporter of profit-related pay and I also support properly organised and fair discretionary share option schemes. I have always been a strong advocate of the rights of part-time workers.<br><br>
The policy rationale behind offering—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let us have some common courtesy in this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The policy rationale behind granting tax reliefs to discretionary share option schemes and profit-related pay is based on the widely accepted principle of encouraging a common interest between workers and management in companies and trying to ensure improvements in company performance. Labour Members fully support that—as, I believe, do Conservative Members. However, the balance in tax treatment currently allowed by the Government between profit-related pay schemes and discretionary share option schemes is wrong. I shall also mention the operation of discretionary share option schemes.<br><br>
The balance is wrong because profit-related pay schemes are limited to £4,000 tax-free or 20 per cent, of earnings, while discretionary share option schemes do not—as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said—have a cap. That allows fat cats on fat salaries to obtain share option schemes worth four times their salary. That needs serious consideration.<br><br>
The current operation of Inland Revenue-approved discretionary share options is neither fair nor reasonable because of the excessive limit of four times a person's salary and because of a fact which has not yet been mentioned in the debate but which was noted in the Inland Revenue's 1994 statistics digest. The digest states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Since 1 January 1992, the option price of a discretionary option can be set as low as 85 per cent, of the market value of the shares at the date the option is granted."</p></blockquote>
I see no compelling reason why share options should be granted at below the prevailing market price. I should welcome the Minister's comments on the matter.<br><br>
I support Opposition Members who have said that discretionary share option schemes should be liable for income tax and should not benefit from a capital gains tax regime which has greater exemptions and allows the deferral of tax for a substantial period.<br><br>
The coverage of discretionary share option schemes is unlikely to benefit part-time workers as the schemes are discretionary, and it is unlikely that many companies will want part-time staff to take part in them. In addition, the benefits are disproportionately skewed towards employees of publicly quoted companies. I know that private companies are allowed to participate in executive share option schemes. But it is far more difficult for them to do so when the market value of shares must be negotiated with the share value division of the capital taxes office rather than through a more transparent process.<br><br>
In terms of the principle of executive share options, we are granting them to employees and directors of publicly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0888">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 677</span>
quoted companies. Such people still represent a relatively narrow proportion of those in employment. We are making it difficult for other workers to enjoy similar benefits. That is another reason why profit-related pay schemes, which provide much wider coverage, offer employees a better incentive and better meet the Government's policy rationale in encouraging performance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Legg</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot support the hon. Gentleman's argument that executive share option schemes are available only to public companies. They are available to private companies and, in my experience, negotiating with the Inland Revenue share prices for share option schemes is a speedy and effective process. If, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dover suggested, the hon. Gentleman gets in touch with the chambers of the Leader of the Opposition, I think that he will receive similar advice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, in my experience, many companies employ fewer than 25 employees; they do not have a regular accountant or lawyer and, because discussions with the share valuation division can be very technical, they do not participate in share option schemes. It would be far simpler to achieve the Government's objectives if tax treatment favoured profit-related pay schemes more than executive share option schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there is a problem of abuse, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, in a number of share option schemes. That is especially true of those which relate to privatised utilities, which has given rise to legitimate public concern. It would be unfortunate, however, if we allowed that to colour our judgment of the idea of providing incentives for workers and management through share options.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will not assume, as some Opposition Members have assumed, that only the workers in a company work and directors do not work. I listened with interest to the distinctions being drawn between executive and non-executive directors. As far as I am aware, there is no legal distinction between executive and non-executive directors: all directors are directors. It may be argued that some are full time and some part time, but even that distinction is difficult to draw. I am not sure when part-time directors become full-time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's point about our assumption that only workers work and directors do not. Of course we are not saying that. But will the hon. Gentleman, when he elaborates on that point, explain why me chief executive of British Gas needs share options amounting to at least £600,000 to make him work harder while the showroom staff of British Gas are to have a 3 per cent, pay cut to make them work harder?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not in this Committee to defend the remuneration package of the chief executive of British Gas. I leave him to account for that to another Committee in this place, as I believe he did earlier this week.<br><br>
I am making the general point that most directors work extremely hard. Many of them may work for only a limited number of hours a week, as do many workers. What is the difference between someone who works
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 678</span>
seven hours a day for five days a week—I believe that many trade unions would like that to be introduced as a working week—and someone who works nine hours a day for four days a week? The latter actually works more hours a week. It is difficult to make such distinctions, especially in a modern society in which working patterns are changing.<br><br>
I hope that we will hear no more of the rhetoric that we heard from the hon. Member for Oxford, East which showed the politics of envy—the old Labour party— rearing its head all over again.<br><br>
I should like to take this opportunity of correcting something that the hon. Member for Oxford, East said. I attempted to intervene at the time, but he had already been generous in giving way to me. However, I know that he would not want to mislead the Committee. He suggested that the profits from executive share option schemes could be rolled over into enterprise investment schemes and venture capital trusts, thereby avoiding paying the tax, to use his words. The hon. Gentleman will know that the tax is not avoided, merely deferred: it will eventually be payable. Any other course would be improper and unreasonable because people would incur a penalty for putting their money into such enterprise investment schemes or venture capital trusts, and I know that members on both sides of the Committee wish to encourage investment in such trusts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that if a cross-section of my constituents had sat at the back of the Room and listened to most of the Committee's proceedings, they would not have been terribly riveted by many of the subjects under discussion. But if they had been here this morning, they would have been enlightened as to how out of touch Conservative Members are with ordinary people. There is a difference between proper profit-related pay schemes by which workers in a company—and that should include part-time workers—get some reward for their efforts, and share option schemes by which part-time directors get windfalls that are unrelated to the effort that they have put in to a company. If Conservative Members do not understand that distinction, they cannot understand how the public view the Government and what goes on in certain parts of the private sector. People see this as the unacceptable face of capitalism.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman enlighten us as to whether he has ever worked in the private sector? Does he understand that directors who work very hard benefit from share options if, as a result of their performance, the company's shares increase in value? That is what creates profit and jobs. If the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends understood the private sector, they would understand that that is what creates jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the first question is yes. I will deal with the hon. Gentleman's second question in more detail in due course.<br><br>
Conservative Members are not listening to the public, nor are they listening to the view of many people who work in the private sector and feel outraged by what has been happening in the past few weeks. They believe that their efforts are related to the pay that they receive and are aggrieved when other people receive windfall profits that are unrelated to their actions. It is not the politics of envy but the politics of fairness.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 679</span>
11.45 am<br><br>
The sense of justice and reasonableness of the British people has been offended by what has been going on. If hon. Members do not understand that, they are out of tune with what the Prime Minister said in Question Time last week. People are awarding themselves what are effectively large pay increases, which are unrelated to performance, over which there are no controls and about which there is no proper disclosure. There is often an attempt to conceal what is happening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly disturbed that the hon. Gentleman has not listened to any speeches made by Conservative Members. We have all agreed with what the hon. Gentleman has said. There have been many unacceptable examples and something needs to be done. We agree with the Prime Minister and the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened and I am still listening for what Conservative Members intend to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I made a suggestion—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We do not want sedentary interventions. If the hon. Member for Beaconsfield wishes to intervene, he must rise to his feet—he is tall enough to be noticed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to say that I have only just begun my speech and do not want an intervention. However, given the strength of my case, I have no worries about what the hon. Gentleman will say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did refer to abuse. I made a suggestion that might be considered in the context of tax legislation, even though Mr. Cedric Brown is one of my constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We all have our problems. Most of my constituents earn significantly less than Mr. Cedric Brown. That is why I say what I do from the Labour Benches. Before I respond to the points raised by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, I must explain that it was he who persuaded me to contribute to the debate because his argument was so badly wrong.<br><br>
Conservative Members are not addressing the sense of injustice that is felt because the schemes are a one-way bet; people can only gain from them—there is no downside. The schemes are not related to performance. That is why people are aggrieved. It is like being given free tickets in a lottery when no one else is entering—one might not win a prize, but one will not lose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend care to refer to the national grid which was almost given to the regional electricity companies. The grid is about to be floated on the market. The directors have not moved a hair's breadth to do anything to deserve it, yet they will probably receive a share option windfall.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes the point completely. Conservative Members are not addressing the issue, nor are they talking to people in the private sector who own
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 680</span>
small or medium-sized companies or have substantial stakes in their companies. Those people run risks as entrepreneurs. If the value of their company increases, they will make money; if it decreases, they lose money. They have a stake in the performance of their company. Those people are also aggrieved about the abuses. Their pay and well-being is related to their efforts towards their company's performance. Conservative Members should talk to such people who are aggrieved because those arrangements are not available to them.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield could not have got it more wrong. Of course, retained profits are the major source of capital for most companies. But the problem is that the percentage of profits that are retained and being used for investment is much smaller in this country than in those of most of our major competitors. That is one of our greatest problems. Let us consider what is happening to investment. We are hardly out of the recession. We have had a bumpy and patchy recovery for a couple of years, and investment is already falling. Capacity in our economy is not sufficient to provide for the long-term future. One of the difficulties is the lack of retained profits and the fact that so many of our profits are distributed. The Government were interested in that subject only a couple of years ago when the previous Financial Secretary was due to consider the issue, but they stopped the report. Why? We have never received an explanation.<br><br>
When the hon. Member for Beaconsfield raised the issue of retained profits, he did not say that because share option schemes—which by their very nature are short-term—reward someone on the basis of an increase in share prices over a relatively short period of time, firms are encouraged to distribute profits rather than retain them. The people who benefit from share option schemes do not profit from the long-term growth of companies. The people with a real stake in companies are those who buy shares and have to see what happens to them over a long period before deciding whether to keep them. A built-in incentive in the schemes encourages directors to distribute profits in the short term. They manoeuvre the situation which increases the value of share prices in the short term. They then take up their share option schemes and sell them as quickly as possible to make their profits. All the evidence shows that people with share option schemes do not keep the shares but take up the options and sell them as quickly as possible. That encourages profits to be distributed, not retained, which is the opposite argument to that advanced by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman also accept that part of our taxation system encourages distribution? If we hold on to shares, we suffer capital gains tax which affects companies and individuals. That tax bears no relation to how long shares are held. There is a fiscal advantage in distributing profits rather than retaining them and taking a capital gain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are many aspects of current Government policy that encourage distribution rather than retention. It would not be possible this morning to put one's finger on the problem and advocate precise solutions, nor would that be a proper part of our debate— you, Mr. Winterton would quickly intervene. However, it has to be recognised that there is a problem. If the tax system could be better used to encourage retention, I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0890">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 681</span>
would consider that. I was sorry that the Government's study of the problem did not go ahead because it meant that Opposition Members were not able to contribute. If the Government had opened the issue, we would have considered whether there were ways to alter the tax system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What matters is not the level of distribution, but the overall level of profitability. It is obvious from the stock market that companies with a relatively low yield are rated higher and vice versa. Under Labour, we had price controls, dividend controls and profit controls—we have reversed that, although British industry is still not profitable enough. We need more profits for more investment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two points. The hon. Gentleman mentioned mechanisms used by a previous Government. He did not say, although he did imply, that there is a problem with the scale of distribution rather than the amount of profits retained. That is a problem for the British economy. Some of his hon. Friends accept that. The previous intervention by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West implicity accepted that that problem needed to be resolved. The hon. Gentleman might argue about the value of share prices and whether the amount retained or distributed affects that. In the long term, it possibly does. But the problem is that, in the short term, the distribution of a greater percentage of profits makes it possible for a company to increase its share prices. We have suffered from successful firms from time to time being taken over because they have retained a high percentage of their profits in an attempt to go in for long-term investment. Share prices have not reflected their true position and they have been taken over as a result.<br><br>
The value of share options has not been related to the effort or work put in by those people who benefit from them. There have been windfall profits—that has been accepted by consultants who considered the issues and by politicians, who probably considered them in a less technical way. When share option schemes are due, it is possible to concentrate on distributive profits in a way that increases the price of the shares and to get better value for the share option schemes.<br><br>
There is a public perception that Conservative Members are not interested in that important problem. Unless Conservative Members start to appreciate that perception, they will pay the cost at the next annual general election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like many other hon. Members, I shall be in my constituency tomorrow and over the weekend. I shall convey to my constituents the nature and tone of speeches by those Conservative Members who have defended share options. The vast majority of people to whom I speak at surgeries, including some business men, would like to know what a share option is. It is a narrow and elite reward system for directors. I shall restrict my remarks to the amendment, although we have had to discuss share options more broadly as a result of the European rulings.<br><br>
Many Conservative Members have discussed incentives. The best incentive that my constituents in Rotherham could have is a job. They are not interested in the rich rewarding themselves. If they have a job, they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 682</span>
would like one with decent pay. I have here a pay slip showing wages of just £1.80 an hour. For a 53-hour week, that adds up to a take-home pay of £99. We should deal with that sort of problem when we devise fiscal rules. We should use the Finance Bill to create wealth and to ensure that work is fairly rewarded and that whatever wealth that is created is fairly distributed.<br><br>
Finally, this morning we have seen a real divide in the Committee—and I do not think that is is only because video cameras are present—between two visions of society. We have been discussing part-time directors and share options. I shall flick open the latest Register of Members' Interests—of the three Conservative Members who are mentioned on pages four and five, 10 remunerated part-time directorships are listed for them. I have looked up four Conservative Members of the Committee—they have 13 remunerated part-time directorships between them. That is why they are so interested in the debate. I shall spare their blushes by not naming them—apart from the hon. Member for Dover, who is a remunerated director of Raptor Residential Investments plc. He obviously represents the Jurassic wing of the Conservative party. It is clear why he chose a company with that name.<br><br>
Lord Hanson, who is an interesting guide to many aspects of this topic, referred to directors who choose to buy shares in their company—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make some progress. I tried to intervene during the speech of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, who is not in his place, but he would not take any of my interventions. I shall come back to the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Hawkins).<br><br>
I have no objection to any scheme that encourages directors to buy shares in their company if they become committed to improving the performance of those companies. The shares, in which they invest their own savings, will reflect that improved performance. However, share options are a bet along the lines of, "Heads I win, tails I cannot lose". They do not even involve taking a punt, as Mr. Leeson is doing for Barings. They are more secure. We shall not encourage commitment to a company by allowing part-time directors—especially in an interlocking network of remuneration committees—to secure money not for extra work but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) pointed out, simply as a result of the ebb and flow of the stock market.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned remuneration committees and he has discussed the interest of Conservative Members. Will he comment on the fact that his hon. and learned Friend the Member for Leicester, West is a remunerated director of Ladbroke plc? Will he also comment on the remunerated directorship of his hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson)? Has the hon. Gentleman ever had any share options during his career before he came to the House?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Member for Rotherham to deal only briefly with that intervention.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0891">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 683</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's last question, the answer is no.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield discussed the need to encourage top managers in the international market. He prayed in aid of the head of British Steel, in whom I have some interest. Although he lives in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, he started life as a gas fitter in my constituency. He has never changed companies. He has simply stayed in his seat, no doubt performing extremely well. However, he was not hired in an international market place. The majority of executives of leading companies in successful economies—such as Germany or Japan—earn a lot, but significantly less than executives or chairmen in this country, even though they do not have the benefit of share option schemes. They do not receive any of the other gifts that the Conservative party has chosen to bestow on a narrow elite of directors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made a serious point about gifts. Perhaps he would care to look at his own entry in the Register of Members' Interests, where he declares that he had a gift of office equipment from a trade union. Why should he accept that gift, which distorts his office costs allowance, and enables him to have more money out of the taxpayer as a result, which he could use for his own purposes? Why should not the director of a public company therefore have share options, which are not a gift, but something that he has had to earn?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are dwelling on matters that are not part of the debate. Members on both sides of the Committee must treat our debate seriously. They must not be diverted to what I must call irrelevant and peripheral matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Betts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I listened to the remarks of the hon. Member for Dover. I realise that you ruled his comments out of order, Mr. Winterton, but an important point remains. The hon. Gentleman said that if money was taken from a trade union, my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham would be able to use his office costs allowance "for his own purposes". The hon. Gentleman should be given the opportunity to withdraw that serious allegation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Member for Dover heard the point of order. Does he wish to respond?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I used the word "might". I did not say that the hon. Gentleman "is" using his allowance in that way. I chose that word specifically, because there has been much publicity about Labour members abusing their office costs allowance as a result of subsidy by trade unions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only say that the hon. Gentleman's reply confirms my earlier judgment that such matters are not part of our debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervened in the House to say that all Members' staff should be paid directly by the Fees Office. Given recent resignations and scandals, it ill behoves the Conservative party to set that hare running in Committee.<br><br>
What will happen as the Bill proceeds? My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East asked that question and I hope that we shall receive an answer today. It is of great public concern and interest. What will the Government
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 684</span>
propose to regulate the matter that will satisfy the public today—not in two, three or four weeks time when they hope that interest will have died down and more scandals will have emerged to occupy our newspapers? Interestingly, the new clause is under the Chief Secretary's name—he is absent; perhaps he is in Paris.<br><br>
The public want an answer today on concrete proposals to end the share option scandal for part-time, wealthy directors—whether they be Conservative Members or the one or two Labour Members—and return, the focus of fiscal policy to where it belongs, on earned income, hard work and a commitment to develop our country's companies as successfully as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Milburn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Darlington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a fascinating debate. I have listened carefully to the contributions of Conservative Members and I feel able to summarise their views clearly. Some Conservative Members take the view, initially expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East, that there are problems with the clause, especially with relation to the Cadbury recommendations. Others do not. Some take the view that there is abuse of share options, especially in the privatised utilities. Others are content to defend that abuse. One aspect unites Conservative Members—they might share the Prime Minister's distaste for excess, but they are prepared to do precisely nothing.<br><br>
Ministers and other Conservative Members cannot have it both ways. If they wish to prevent abuse of share options, there should be a clause before us today that expresses in black and white how the Government will achieve that. Instead, we only have a wish list—a series of no doubt admirable intentions, with a succession of leaks to the press during the past few days. That is not good enough. I am left wondering who speaks for the Government. Is it the Prime Minister, who stands up in the Chamber of the House of Commons, expresses his distaste and suggests the possibility of legislation? Or is it the Financial Secretary, who comes to the Committee, expresses distaste and brings forward precisely no legislative proposals? They cannot have it both ways. Labour Members do not want to hear more words, concerns and rhetoric about abuse; they want firm action. That is what the public want. I am extremely worried that the Prime Minister's good intentions about rectifying abuse are betrayed by the wording of the new clause.<br><br>
It is the new clause that we are discussing today, not something that might be brought up on Report. Ministers—the Financial Secretary in particular—had the opportunity today to introduce the proposal that they intend to introduce on Report. Instead, we have to rely on further leaks, promises and good intentions. That is not good enough.<br><br>
The new clause widens the potential for abuse. Not only does it ignore the Cadbury recommendations, which were alluded to by several Conservative Members and by my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East, but, more importantly, it ignores the depth of public concern about the issue.<br><br>
Conservative Members attempt to categorise our views on the matter as representative of the politics of envy. It is the politics of anger, not envy. We reflect the anger that members of the public feel about the issue. The public are fed up to their back teeth with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0892">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 685</span>
executive excess at the top while the great majority struggle to make ends meet. We cannot tell workers to tighten their belts when a very few at the top receive greatly enhanced salaries.<br><br>
I want to make it clear that we believe that people should be rewarded for improved performance. Share options and other bonuses, however, should relate to improved performance and should not be a substitution for salaries. Sometimes the share option seems to be more important than the salary. That is why we argue that share options must be accompanied by agreed performance targets. One of the most disgraceful and scandalous reasons for the latest recall of the chief executive of British Gas to the Employment Select Committee was that, as we now know, the award to Cedric Brown was made after British Gas decided in the middle of last year to abolish the share option scheme for its directors because,
<br><blockquote><p>"it operated without, performance criteria and was therefore insufficiently testing."</p></blockquote>
The company, however, decided to delay the winding-up to award an additional package to a few directors at the top. That is not good enough.<br><br>
Every member of the Committee knows that share prices can rise or fall for bad or good reasons. We want share options to be accompanied by performance targets for individual companies to make an even clearer link between performance and payout. The clause prevents that from happening and, in my view, opens up even more unhealthy divisions in our society while the public clamour for more justice and fairness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The real question that emerges from the debate is not who speaks for the Government, but who speaks for the Labour party. Those who have followed our debate will have been struck by the contrast between the soft image portrayed by the leadership outside and the harsh rhetoric that we have heard this morning from people who are fundamentally opposed to the principle behind the new clause of giving more opportunity to employees in our firms.<br><br>
It has been good go have a real political debate. Those who have been able to watch it may have been misled into thinking that our previous 21 sessions have been as lively as this one. Sadly, that has not been the case.<br><br>
I want to deal briefly with some points that have been made. The hon. Member for Oxford, East began his remarks by welcoming the new clause in principle, although much of what he went on to say challenged the thinking behind it. He proceeded to deliver a speech that was written some time ago and that is now past its shelf life. On Tuesday he chided the Government for answering a parliamentary question by announcing our intentions. On Thursday he comes along and says that he does not believe that we plan to implement those changes anyway. He cannot have it both ways—either we are going ahead or we are not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman tell the Committee whether he authorised the reports to the newspapers before that question was planted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I authorised no reports to the press and I want to make it absolutely clear that I deplore the premature leaking of Government policy.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 686</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Milburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Financial Secretary is so concerned about the leak to the press, will he conduct an inquiry into the source of the leak?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will consider that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Milburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government will?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will, but frankly the history of previous leak enquiries under all Governments has not been especially productive and we need to ask whether they are a sensible use of scarce resources.<br><br>
Another interesting point to emerge from the debate was that the Opposition want to change the basis of taxation from capital gains tax to income tax. The reason is because they want to raise the rate of income tax. The top rate of income tax is the same as capital gains tax. There are some relatively minor reliefs, but there is a hidden agenda and that is why they want to switch the burden of taxation from capital gains to income tax. They have plans, which they have not disclosed, to jack up the top rate of income tax.<br><br>
In the interests of progress, I shall deal quickly with the Opposition's amendment. It does not fully meet its objective of ensuring that part-time directors cannot participate in executive share option schemes. Now that the schemes are to be open to part-time as well as full-time employees, there is a possibility that part-time directors will seek to avoid the ban on inclusion in the schemes by having themselves reclassified as employees. We need to guard against that possibility, and I shall bear that in mind when I frame the Government amendments.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I draw the right hon. Gentleman's attention to the Inland Revenue press release on that subject. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The subsections remove the reference to 'full-time' in relation to directors, and the 20 hour requirement in relation to employees, with the effect that, in future, schemes will be able, if they wish, to extend participation to all directors and employees."</p></blockquote>
If that is the Inland Revenue's explanation of the Government's new clause, why is it so difficult to accept the amendment, which simply restores the previous situation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because directors could, if they wanted, obtain contracts as employees and thereby circumvent the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman tell the Committee what prevents them from doing that at the moment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will come on to the Government's proposals—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What stops them?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Gentleman is not giving way.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 687</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me try to make progress. I propose to deal with the hon. Gentleman's questions.<br><br>
The other problem is that the amendment deals with only one part of the story—executive option schemes. If we are to respond adequately to the representations that we have received, we need to preserve the existing treatment of part-time directors in all four share schemes. That means dealing with profit-sharing schemes, savings-related option schemes and ESOPs. For those two reasons, we cannot accept the amendment tabled by the Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for giving way. He says that the amendment cannot be accepted because there is a possibility that part-time directors will recast their contracts as employees. But the question that he avoided, when I put it to him before, was what prevents part-time directors from doing that at the moment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Part-time directors cannot do that at the moment because they are prevented by the law. The new clause responds to the ruling of the House of Lords, which said that we were discriminating against part-timers. We have now decided—we believe that this complies with the House of Lords judgment—to exclude part-time directors and return to the current position.<br><br>
The reason for the delay is that it is only relatively recently that a decision was reached. There is nothing to be gained from rushing into making the necessary changes. As we have just discovered, rushing to introduce an amendment often means that it is not right. The amendments that will be introduced on Report will prevent part-time directors from participating in approved tax-relieved executive share option schemes and in qualifying tax-relieved employee share ownership plans. They will give companies the choice whether to include part-time directors in all employee savings-related share option schemes and in all employee profit-sharing schemes. In each case, they will maintain the present treatment of part-time directors and the clause will apply only to part-time employees.<br><br>
I come now to the point raised by the hon. Member for Oxford, East on the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield—the interaction of new clause 5 with existing profit-related pay schemes and, in particular, interaction with the so-called 80 per cent. test. I have considered my hon. Friend's thoughtful amendment, but it does not provide an acceptable solution to the difficulty. It seems to assume that profit-related pay legislation will, in future, oblige an employer to offer PRP to 100 per cent, of his staff, including all part-time workers. That is not the case. The 80 per cent, test recognises that there will be circumstances in which it will not be appropriate or possible for all employees to be eligible. Some flexibility for employers is reasonable.<br><br>
In seeking specifically to reinstate the exclusion of part-timers from the 80 per cent, test, the amendment would put the clock back and deprive part-timers of the right to be treated on an equal footing with full-time employees. In short, my hon. Friend's amendment would have a discriminatory effect. However, I have been trying to discover whether there are other ways round the genuine problems that my hon. Friend mentioned. In some
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 688</span>
businesses, in which part-time workers are mostly short-term employees such as seasonal workers or students working in evenings or weekends, it may still be possible not to count such non-taxpayers for the purpose of the 80 per cent. test. It may be possible to do that by using the facility to exclude employees with less than three years' service from the count.<br><br>
A second alternative would be to use a different sort of PRP scheme. If employees were not asked to make a pay sacrifice, but were offered PRP as part of an annual pay settlement, or in addition to base pay, there would be no difficulty in getting 80 per cent, to agree. I believe that several successful high street retailers use schemes of that sort. I do not believe, therefore, that my hon. Friend's amendment is the answer. There may be another way, but I want to reflect on some of the points that were made during the debate on PRP.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield made the valid point that good management is an international resource, for which there is a market price, and it is in the interests of employees, customers and shareholders that our companies should have access to that resource for which they must offer competitive salaries and terms of employment. The hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) misunderstood new clause 5 because four of the schemes apply to employees generally; it does not relate exclusively to non-executive directors. As I said, 6.8 million part-time workers will be enfranchised by new clause 5.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, Southwest (Mr. Legg) asked how I would approach the European dimension against the background of previous decisions. The reason why the European Court takes an interest in part-timers was because 86 per cent, of them are women. It believes that discrimination against part-timers is discrimination against women. Eighty-six per cent, of non-executive directors are not women. Therefore, we do not think that the European Court would find the same objection to our treatment of non-executives.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson) and other hon. Members raised matters that are relevant to Greenbury and post-Greenbury. My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West asked how we would implement new clause 5, as amended. In fact, we are maintaining the status quo, so there should be no difficulties.<br><br>
In answer to the question of the hon. Member for Dudley, West, executive options are not granted at below market price, except where the company also has an all-employee scheme. There are very few schemes with discounted options. Several hon. Members suggested that we might tax the exercise of options rather than their disposal. But that would require people to dispose of some of their shares to pay the income tax or capital gains tax, which goes against the philosophy of trying to encourage people to obtain a stake in the company. I hope that the amendments will be resisted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the point that both I and the hon. Member for Beaconsfield raised about the implications for employers with a large number of part-time workers who do not pay tax and, therefore, do not benefit from the schemes, does the right hon. Gentleman accept that to draw some distinction, however the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0894">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 689</span>
Government justify it in their review, may risk falling foul of the House of Lords ruling and the European directive because it is likely that a disproportionately large number of women will be unable to take advantage of the scheme?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are alert to that. I outlined two ways around the problem of the 80 per cent, test, one of which is to make it prospective, which would give part-time workers an incentive to vote for it. The other is to use an existing provision, which excludes those who have worked for less than three years, which I do not think has been challenged. However, as I said, I shall reflect on that. The new clause is about the extension of opportunity. It makes share ownership more accessible and gives more people a stake in our society. I hope that the Committee will accept new clause 5.</span></p>

INHERITANCE TAX: AGRICULTURAL PROPERTY</div> <!-- title -->
<p>".—(1) In section 116 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 (relief for transfers of agricultural property) in subsection (2) (rate of relief) the word 'either' shall be omitted and at the end of paragraph (b) there shall be inserted 'or
<br><blockquote><p>(c) the interest of the transferor in the property immediately before the transfer does not carry either of the rights mentioned in paragraph (a) above because the property is let on a tenancy beginning on or after 1st September 1995;'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>(2) Subsection (1) above shall apply in relation to transfers of value made, and other events occurring, on or after 1st September 1995."—<i>[Mr. Nelson.]</i></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Anthony Nelson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
Under the existing inheritance tax legislation, agricultural property is eligible for agricultural relief from tax. Working farmers and tenants get 100 per cent, relief, which is in effect total exemption. Agricultural landlords generally get 50 per cent, relief.<br><br>
The relief, together with the other inheritance tax improvements that we have made over the years, ensures that most family farms can be passed on intact without a forced sale or break-up arising from the need to pay an inheritance tax bill. It also recognises the special role of landlords in the agricultural industry.<br><br>
Our proposals in the Agricultural Tenancies Bill, which is currently before Parliament, are intended to reform agricultural tenancy law and to deregulate and stimulate the market for let farm land. The new clause to the Finance Bill complements those proposals. It equalises the inheritance tax treatment of working fanners and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0895">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 691</span>
agricultural landlords by extending full exemption to let farmland. It underlines the objectives of our tenancy reforms and provides further valuable encouragement to landowners to make more land available to tenant fanners. That will introduce much-needed new blood into the industry by enabling younger people with little or no capital to take up farming. It will also boost the rural economy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hilary Armstrong <span class='memberconstituency'>(Durham, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is an important and laudable aim to try to find ways of encouraging new tenancies on agricultural land. There is a serious problem, especially with young people who are unable to have access to land for farming and are not being encouraged into farming. I support the Government's intention of extending the opportunity to enter farming, but I am worried that the relief may be used as a means of avoiding inheritance tax.<br><br>
I seek reassurance that the Government have considered that and that steps will be taken to ensure that this important change will not be used simply as a means of avoiding inheritance tax. There are examples under current law of passive farmers—people with a passive interest in farming—who avoid hefty inheritance tax. They have bought agricultural land, and that is not what we want because it is important that our agricultural land should be used as effectively as possible. I know that you Mr. Winterton, have an interest in that in your constituency, as I do in mine.<br><br>
The new clause is causing great interest among tenant farmers, particularly those who currently farm land owned by British Coal—one of the largest owners of farm land in the country. That land is to be sold within the next year and those tenants are concerned that their land should not be bought by people seeking to avoid tax who would fall within the terms of the new clause but who might not have a real interest in farming the land properly. There might be problems because such people might be prepared to offer a price that the tenants would be unable to match.<br><br>
I seek an assurance that the Government have thought their way through the issue and are prepared to make sure that existing tenant farmers who wish to buy their farm when it is sold by British Coal will not be gazumped by people who are looking for a means of avoiding inheritance tax.<br><br>
How will the Government prevent the measure from being used for the purchase of agricultural land as a wholly passive investment to secure 100 per cent. exemption from inheritance tax? Why have the Government not linked the measure to a requirement that tenant farmers should have some security of tenure? That could be one means of restricting the scope of tax abuse which would also provide stability for tenant farmers. Why is there no restriction on the size of an agricultural holding eligible for tax relief, as there was when the scheme was first introduced in 1975? I have also not been able to work out why the relief will apply only to transfers on or after 1 September 1995.<br><br>
I do not want to detain the Committee on the issue, but we are anxious that the measure should be used only to help tenant farmers to gain access to farming land. I want an assurance that, if there is any evidence that people are buying land without the sole intention of making sure that it is farmed by tenant farmers, encouraging new tenants if possible, the Government will reconsider the matter.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 692</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise two brief points arising from the Government's apparent intention to use the tax system—in this case inheritance tax in agricultural holdings—to encourage new entrants into agriculture.<br><br>
First, I re-emphasise the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West about the restriction of the concession on the size of holding. We all support the aim of encouraging new entrants into farming, but new entrants clearly do not want big holdings, they want small, manageable holdings. Even if the Minister does not accept the point, he must recognise that somebody coming into the business does not start by acquiring a massive holding. People almost always start with a smallish holding, so a restriction on the size of holding would be a further guarantee that the measure would not be used as a tax abuse.<br><br>
Secondly, if the intention is to encourage new, younger people to enter the farming business, why is there apparently no direct link between the benefit that will accrue to the land holder in inheritance tax and the benefit to the new entrant? If the Government are keen to encourage new entrants would it not be better if they proposed that some benefit should flow through from this tax relief to the new entrants?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can reassure the hon. Members for Durham, North-West (Ms Armstrong) and for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson). I welcome what I took to be their support for the broad intent of the new clause. We hope that, as a result of this reform and the Agricultural Tenancies Bill, about 1.6 million acres of new land in England and Wales will be brought forward. That amounts to 17 per cent, of the current stock. The Committee must understand that lettings have virtually dried up and it is important to try to bring further land forward.<br><br>
On the point about avoidance, the relief has strict qualifying conditions which target it on farm land used for the purpose of agriculture. The land has to be both owned by the landlord for a period of seven years and used in farming throughout that period. Thus speculative short-term investments would not benefit from the extended relief. That answers the hon. Lady's point. The date is set as 1 September because that is when the Agricultural Tenancies Bill comes into effect.<br><br>
As for the size of holdings involved, there is no good reason to discriminate against larger lettings in favour of smaller lettings in this respect. There is no reason to impose a continued inheritance tax liability on larger let properties when smaller let properties would be exempt and when under the rules we passed last year in the Finance Act the landlord's property would have been exempt anyway if it was in-hand fanning. As in many cases, we are interested not only in small amounts of land being let but in larger more efficient farms and acreages coming on to the market too. There is no reason to discriminate against larger holdings or larger lettings.<br><br>
The combination of the Bill and this clause should free up and bring forward a lot of new let land. Under the protections and guarantees that are provided, it cannot be used as a short-term avoidance mechanism. That should answer the fair point that the hon. Lady raised on behalf of the miners.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the hon. Gentleman to resume his seat. I cannot accept that there is any point of order on what has just taken place. I suspect that the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) was about to ask where members of the Liberal Democrat party are. I, from the Chair, have no responsibility for members of that party, or for their whereabouts at this time. I can only regret that they are not here to move their new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo: <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
I shall put the clause in context and remind the Committee of the Government's charter commitment on visits to firms. In 1992, the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury instigated a series of fundamental expenditure reviews—FERs—for each Government Department. This was, in our view, a necessary cost-cutting exercise because of the Government's economic incompetence. The key result of the Customs and Excise FER is that 4,015 jobs will be cut in the coming four years and that the number of collections—administration—regions will be cut from 21 to 14. The number of VAT staff will be reduced from 5,400 to 3,395—a reduction of more than 2,000 staff. That is relevant to the new clause because we believe that the cuts will undermine Customs and Excise's ability to continue effectively to collect outstanding VAT, and to ensure especially that the complex regulations can be operated properly.<br><br>

Last week, the National Audit Office published its report on the Government's decision to write off more than £800 million of uncollected VAT in 1993, for various reasons. We think that the Government's policy of cutting the number of VAT officers will continue to frustrate effective collections.<br><br>
Those cuts came on top of spending cuts in 1992, single market changes, and market testing—all of which have produced extremely low morale in Customs and Excise. The Government's plans to target VAT officers' visits to business are inadequate. Small traders—those with a turnover of less than £100,000 a year—generate 6 per cent, of the revenue collected, but absorb 22 per cent, of the VAT control effort. The FER therefore proposed abandoning altogether first visits to a large proportion of small traders and abandoning routine visits to small and medium-sized businesses that are thought to be compliant—that is, making their returns correctly.<br><br>
That raises four specific issues. The first is the question of public service. A major part of the inspectors' work is helping businesses to comply with complicated VAT law. That is achieved by one-to-one visits and fulfilling the VAT charter commitment, issued by the Government in 1992, to visit every newly registered trader within three years.<br><br>
The visits and, therefore, the charter commitment would be abandoned under the proposal in the fundamental expenditure review. Should that be followed through, it would again demonstrate the meaninglessness of the provisional charters and the inability of the Government to connect reality with their aspirations for fairness and openness.<br><br>
The Government propose to replace the visits with what they call educational seminars. That is totally inadequate. It does not respond to what businesses want, but will increase compliance costs and reduce the level of service.<br><br>
The Public Accounts Committee, in its report "The Cost to Business of Complying with VAT Requirements"—41st report, 1993–94—stated in paragraph 25:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Department have recognised the importance of early contact with newly-registered traders as being most likely to need advice and education and who often face proportionately the highest compliance costs".</p></blockquote>
It continued in paragraph 33:
<br><blockquote><p>"in 1992/93, some 11,000 newly-registered traders were overdue a visit by one month. Given the benefits of early contact, we"—</p></blockquote>
the PAC
<br><blockquote><p>"look to the Department to reduce the number of overdue visits as a matter of priority".</p></blockquote>
The clear advice is that early visits followed by regular visits to businesses assist with compliance costs and, most important, assist in the effective collection for the Government of the money that is outstanding through VAT.<br><br>
A Customs report, entitled "The VAT Business Needs Survey", issued in November 1994, revealed that 89 per cent, of businesses wanted the same or more frequent VAT visits and that they would prefer a one-to-one consultation to a seminar. The Federation of Small
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 696</span>
Businesses also supported the principle of regular visits, yet the Government are going in the opposite direction.<br><br>
First visits are highly effective, as VAT can be explained within the context of a trader's particular business and accountancy system. Seminars would not cater for continuing need, and, even if they did, staff reductions will mean that the closure of a large number of VAT offices will make attendance at seminars more and more difficult due to their location.<br><br>
The second point is about tax yield. The proposed cuts are counterproductive. There is a clear link between the number of visits and overall compliance. Consequently, there is a considerable risk that evasion will increase significantly, undermining the long-term tax yield.<br><br>
A recent experiment in Birmingham bears out that suspected link. Of a random selection of 300 businesses, half were visited and half were not. In the following year, the tax yield of the businesses that had been visited increased by 20 per cent., whereas the tax yield of those that had not been visited increased by only 8 per cent. That points to the obvious fact that visits have a preventive effect on tax evasion.<br><br>
The Government say that they will maintain the tax yield by better targeting, but that ignores the point that the overall number of visits is more important than the result of one visit. Their plan is underpinned by a new risk assessment system, but they seem to have little or no idea of how that would work.<br><br>
My third point relates to tax equities. The removal of controls creates unfair competition because those traders who are honest and who comply fully with the VAT requirements are undercut by those who are not honest and do not comply. That is a particular problem for small businesses, which often have to choose between committing the same fraud or going under because their businesses are not viable.<br><br>
My final point relates to payments and accounts. It is claimed that the FER will remove the burdens on business. We do not believe that that is the case. The Government have two more VAT proposals: VAT annual returns and a simplified system. That would involve small businesses in assessment of turnover by customs and lead to filing returns and keeping records, which would make the system more complicated.<br><br>
Our new clause would enforce the charter commitment of visiting every newly registered business within three years by making it a statutory duty. That would ensure VAT compliance and, therefore, protect the tax yield. It would also safeguard jobs, which is very important, and would provide for important prevention work in ensuring a sensible compliance with our tax laws.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will accept the new clause as uncontentious and vote for it, because it would simply make the charter commitment a statutory requirement.</span></p>
