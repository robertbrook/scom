<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Finance Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome all hon. Members to the first sitting of the 1995 Standing Committee on the Finance Bill. I speak on behalf of my fellow Chairman when I say that we are confident that it will be a constructive and well-ordered Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Jonathan Aitken)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move two motions—first, the sittings motion and, secondly, the procedure motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Chief Secretary must move only one motion at a time. I ask him to move the sittings motion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Aitken</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise and accept your guidance with gratitude, Mr. Winterton.<br><br>
I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Finance Bill (except Clauses 2, 5, 8, 15, 52, 64 and 91 and Shedules 1, 4, 11 and 14) the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
As is customary, I warmly welcome you, Mr. Winterton, to the Chair. We all look forward to serving under your experienced and penetrating eye. I have already experienced an example of your skill—as, no doubt, will all members of the Committee in due course. I hope that it will in no way lessen the dignity of the Chair if I recollect that in the salad days of our parliamentary youths, both of us had something of a reputation for independence of mind, spirit and voting habit. I mention that only because the general delight that the Committee will feel at having you in the Chair will be enhanced in the Government Whip, who will be very pleased that you are in a position of such dignity and impartiality.<br><br>
I congratulate you, Mr. Winterton, on chairing a Committee that is an historic first in breaking new procedural ground. This is the first time that Finance Bill Standing Committee proceedings have started in a morning. Sittings will be in the morning and the afternoon, Tuesdays and Thursdays, with the exception of this afternoon. The fact does not appear in the motion, for reasons which the distinguished and learned Clerk described as metaphysical. We all understand that it will be only this afternoon that we shall not be sitting.<br><br>
The reform will enhance our proceedings. When the matter was raised on Second Reading, the shadow Chief Secretary, the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith), was kind enough to say that it would enable the Opposition and, indeed, Government Back Benchers to scrutinise with even greater rigour than is usual. We can perhaps avoid the late-night highland fling that we had last night, if only because it will come along at the more the dansant hour of approximately 6 pm.<br><br>
I am certain that the reform will improve the quality of our debates, to say nothing of the working lives of hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Members. It will also make a difference to the many outside bodies and individuals who want to listen to our deliberations, whether they are from the professions, the unions, industry, the press or another interest. Unless they are inveterate night owls they, too, will be pleased by the reform.<br><br>
I pay tribute to the Opposition for making the reform possible by their co-operation. I commend the sittings motion to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join the Chief Secretary in welcoming you, Mr. Winterton, to the Committee. As the right hon. Gentleman said, you are renowned for your fairness, independence of mind and firm control of proceedings. I am sure that that will guide our deliberations. We are pleased that Mr. Hogg will also be chairing our sittings. He, too, is well regarded throughout the House for his fairness and firmness and for the clarity and intelligence of his rulings.<br><br>
The initial great excitement of our victory on value added tax on fuel appears to have exhausted a good part of the interest in and excitement about our proceedings. The amendments that the Government have already been forced to concede and the debates on vehicle excise duty in the islands last night on the Floor of the House show that the Bill still has the capacity to surprise. The Opposition will do all we can to spring surprises on the Government, not least because this is the first Finance Bill for some time on which the Government have had a majority of only one.<br><br>
We shall also make good use of the additional time made available by the introduction of morning sittings, which we all welcome. Whether we debate into the night will depend, in large measure, on the Chief Secretary and his hon. Friends. We had an instructive lesson in the Chamber last night. When Ministers' replies are less than adequate they will be put under remorseless pressure.<br><br>
In addition to my good friends on the Front Bench and my good friends on the Back Benches who could not resist coming back for another Finance Bill—such is its appeal—the Opposition bring something that the Government cannot bring, namely, by-election victors from this Parliament. It gives me great pleasure to welcome to our proceedings my hon. Friends the Members for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell), for Barking (Ms Hodge), for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe), for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson), for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) and for Newham, North-East (Mr. Timms). It must be the first time that a Finance Bill Committee has had six by-election victors on the Opposition Benches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not sure what relevance that point has to the sittings motion, but if it will bring this part of the debate to a rather quicker conclusion, can I say that I was also a by-election victor?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome what you say, Mr. Winterton. It shows what a fine example will be set to our proceedings on this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a by-election victor on two occasions I should like to draw your attention, Mr. Winterton, to an ambiguity in the motion. The motion refers to "half-past Ten o'clock" and "half-past Four o'clock" but not to whether that is the morning
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0510">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
or the afternoon. I should like some clarification. The Committee has never met in the mornings before, so I should like to know whether it means half-past Ten o'clock in the morning or in the evening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to advise the hon. Gentleman that it means half-past Ten o'clock in the morning and half-past Four o'clock in the afternoon.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Finance Bill (except Clauses 2, 5, 8, 15, 52, 64 and 91 and Schedules 1, 4, 11 and 14) the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have one or two announcements to make. Copies of the Ways and Means resolutions on which the Bill is founded are in the Room and available to hon. Members. Amendments will not be called unless proper notice of them has been given. As a general rule, neither I nor my co-Chairman will select starred amendments. I want to emphasise that announcement. Because of the quantity of paperwork on this Bill green boxes are available and hon. Members can collect them after the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Aitken</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Order in which proceedings on the Finance Bill are to be taken shall be Clause 1, Clauses 3 and 4, Schedule 2, Clauses 6 and 7, Clauses 9 and 10, Schedule 3, Clauses 11 to 14, Clauses 16 to 28, Schedule 5, Clauses 29 to 33, Schedule 6, Clauses 34 to 36, Schedule 7, Clauses 37 to 45, Schedule 8, Clauses 46 and 47, Schedule 9, Clause 48, Schedule 10, Clauses 49 to 51, Clauses 53 to 59, Schedule 12. Clauses 60 and 61, Schedule 13, Clauses 62 and 63, Clause 65, Schedule 15, Clause 66, Schedule 16, Clauses 67 and 68, Schedule 17, Clause 69, Schedule 18, Clauses 70 to 73, Schedule 19, Clauses 74 to 90, Clauses 92 to 94, Schedule 20, Clauses 95 to 103, Schedule 21, Clauses 104 to 110, Schedule 22, Clauses 111 to 113, Schedule 23. Clauses 114 to 117, Schedule 24, Clauses 118 to 120, Schedule 25, Clauses 121 and 122, Schedule 26, Clauses 123 to 125, Schedule 27. Clauses 126 to 136, Schedule 28, Clauses 137 to 142, Clause 144, new Clauses (except any designed to continue the statutory effect of any of the Ways and Means Resolutions of the House of 13th December), new Schedules, Clause 143, Schedule 29.</p></blockquote>
It might help the Committee if I said a few words about the proposed order of the clauses and schedules. We propose that the Committee should work through the Bill in numerical order, apart from those clauses and schedules which have been considered by the Committee of the whole House and the repeals, which will be taken last. We also propose that the Committee considers relevant schedules immediately after the clauses to which they relate. That is sensible as, in most cases, the subject matters of the clause and schedule are inextricably linked.<br><br>
Relatively few hon. Members present served on the equivalent Committee last year. I note the shadow Chief Secretary's enthusiasm for having by-election victors on his side, but I do not know whether they have been selected because they are so keen or because they are so green. We welcome them. There are reminders on Conservative Benches of at least two by-election victories, proving that victory at a by-election can result in long and distinguished service on Finance Bill Committees.<br><br>
The suggested procedure is different from last year because that Committee dealt first with clauses that had already been published in draft form. The aim of that was to allow outside interests more time to make
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
representations on clauses that had not previously been published in draft. On reflection, the Government feel that that was an interesting experiment, but one that produced fewer benefits than expected. Handling the Bill out of numerical order became unduly complicated for everyone, which is why we have decided to revert to the more usual, sensible and straightforward ordering of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Order in which proceedings on the Finance Bill are to be taken shall be Clause 1, Clauses 3 and 4, Schedule 2, Clauses 6 and 7, Clauses 9 and 10, Schedule 3, Clauses 11 to 14, Clauses 16 to 28, Schedule 5, Clauses 29 to 33, Schedule 6, Clauses 34 to 36, Schedule 7, Clauses 37 to 45, Schedule 8, Clauses 46 and 47, Schedule 9, Clause 48, Schedule 10, Clauses 49 to 51, Clauses 53 to 59, Schedule 12, Clauses 60 and 61, Schedule 13, Clauses 62 and 63, Clause 65, Schedule 15, Clause 66, Schedule 16, Clauses 67 and 68, Schedule 17, Clause 69, Schedule 18, Clauses 70 to 73, Schedule 19, Clauses 74 to 90, Clauses 92 to 94, Schedule 20, Clauses 95 to 103, Schedule 21, Clauses 104 to 110, Schedule 22, Clauses 111 to 113, Schedule 23, Clauses 114 to 117, Schedule 24, Clauses 118 to 120, Schedule 25, Clauses 121 and 122, Schedule 26, Clauses 123 to 125, Schedule 27, Clauses 126 to 136, Schedule 28, Clauses 137 to 142, Clause 144, new Clauses (except any designed to continue the statutory effect of any of the Ways and Means Resolutions of the House of 13th December), new Schedules, Clause 143, Schedule 29.</p></blockquote></p>

ALCOHOLIC INGREDIENTS RELIEF</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister could answer some questions on the complex arrangements described in the clause. There still appear to be some anomalies in the Government's aims with this clause, which is about alcoholics—[<i>Laughter.</i>] No, it is not. Last night was a long night, Mr. Winterton. The clause is about relief for alcoholic ingredients and it introduces a new scheme for repayment of duty on alcohol used in preparing food, non-alcoholic beverages and vinegar. Relief is likely to be withdrawn only for products not intended for human consumption, but I note that, for example, beer shampoo is not to be covered. I do not mean that people would drink beer shampoo. Indeed, I would not use it at all. However, as the clause is drafted to deal specifically with products that have alcohol as an ingredient but are not for human consumption, I should be grateful if the Minister could say which products will be exempt and which will not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause would unify two separate systems of relief for the repayment of duty on alcohol used in the production of qualifying products. Although I believe the clause to be uncontentious, I am keen to explain it to the Committee.<br><br>
Several differing products—some in the soft drinks and food industries and others in the pharmaceutical industry—use alcohol. The clause brings together two sorts of relief—that of the duty on spirits and that of the duty on beer, wine and cider. The reliefs currently operate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0511">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
under separate primary legislation and the clause combines them in a single, simplified system.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
The sorts of products that the clause covers include liqueur chocolates, whisky marmalade, fruit in brandy, particular flavours of ice cream and soft drinks that contain small amounts of alcohol. The hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) was right to say that the clause does not refer to products such as beer shampoo. However, a few uses that do not qualify for relief under the clause will be tackled in clause 4, which, under the new denatured alcohol scheme, provides for claimants to continue to manufacture their duty-relieved, denatured alcohol. Although products such as beer shampoo are not helped by the clause, they are covered later in the Bill.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 5, 51 and 52.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are consequential on our deliberations yesterday when a Committee of the whole House considered clause 15 and schedule 4. Amendment No. 4 would extend the entitlement to use rebated fuel to agricultural tractors that are used on public roads to power hedge and verge-cutting equipment. It would allow farmers to cut hedges and verges without refuelling their tractors with duty-paid diesel. Local authorities or private contractors that use tractors to cut hedges and verges will also be able to use rebated fuel.<br><br>
Amendment No. 5 is again consequential on clause 15 and schedule 4. It would extend the entitlement to use rebated diesel to light agricultural vehicles, which operate in similar circumstances to tractors but are for lighter work. It would cover, for example, all-terrain vehicles that are now familiar in agricultural use. We agreed yesterday to extend to them the vehicle excise duty concession at the same rate as for tractors. The amendment would allow such vehicles to use rebates for diesel, if they are diesel powered, in the same circumstances as tractors.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 are for clarification to show that the vehicle in question can be kept at any location. Amendment No. 52 would bring the definition
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
of road construction vehicles up to date by ensuring that it applies to the construction and repair of roads either at public expense or using private funds. Hon. Members will know that under a Government initiative several road schemes and toll road schemes will be financed and built using the design, build, finance and operate road scheme. The amendment ensures that vehicles used for such projects are treated exactly as though they were being used to make or repair roads at public expense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government's amendments on rebated fuel—red diesel—are a further example of the mess the Government have got themselves into with the changes that the Bill introduces to vehicle excise duty. Prior to the Bill, rebated fuel was linked to vehicle excise duty rates. The Bill comprehensively changes those rates. During yesterday's very detailed debate, the Minister suggested that the Government's reason for amending the vehicle excise duty classes was their wish to simplify a complex system. However, on closer scrutiny of the simplified system it became clear that farmers' vehicles—which are now also covered by the amendment—road recovery vehicles, snow ploughs, glitters and other classes of vehicles were removed not only from concessionary or exempt rates on vehicle excise duty, but from the rebated fuel categories. The Government's so-called simplified system then required amendment by the Government to make it more complicated, so that it reflected the reality of use. Changes were necessary relating to classes of vehicles used by farmers, and in particular vehicles that travel fewer than six miles per week on the public highway. I understand that the amendments relate specifically to those.<br><br>
Last night on the Floor of the House the Government conceded changes to vehicle excise duty. Today they have tabled amendments to correct the anomaly that they created between vehicle excise duty schedules and schedules for rebating fuel. They have transformed a need for one schedule dealing with both vehicle excise duty and concessionary and exempt rates—triggering the rebated fuel categories—into a need for two separate schedules, one for rebated fuel and another for vehicle excise duty. Without a separate schedule for rebated fuel many small businesses would be damaged.<br><br>
We should be grateful, even at this late stage of the Bill, for the fact that the Government have realised their error. We assume that Customs and Excise has informed the Government that if they did not deal with the issue of rebated fuel the farming community, in particular, would suffer immense damage.<br><br>
The rationale for the Government's argument is now destroyed. They told us that there would be a simplified system, but many classes of vehicle are now discriminated against and many small businesses—for instance, those with road recovery vehicles—will be in a worse position. The Government seek to protect only one section—the farmers, who will receive the rebated fuel. That is no way to proceed with a schedule and clauses that are highly complex. I admit to struggling with the intricacies of vehicle excise duty in trying to understand the Bill. Moreover, as was clearly demonstrated by the proceedings in the House yesterday, both the Committee of the whole House and the Minister had enormous difficulty in grasping the simple principles that now guide us through vehicle excise duty and rebated fuel. Although
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0512">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
we are more than happy that the Government have corrected the anomaly—one that they created themselves—we still believe that the new system is more complex and that it is likely to be open to abuse and misuse in the same way as the classifications that the Government have removed.<br><br>
Will the Minister tell the Committee that he is absolutely satisfied that no small business that currently receives rebated fuel will lose the category of rebated fuel and that the amendments to the original proposals, which would have damaged so badly the farming communities, will maintain the status quo so that their businesses can try to flourish?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although this is undoubtedly a complex reform, that does not entitle the hon. Lady to parody the clause. We have undertaken a radical, simplifying measure in vehicle excise duty, which I believe has the Committee's general support. We are reducing from 132 to nine the number of classes specifying the exemptions and concessions. As I explained at length to the Committee of the whole House, that will bring great benefits to users and administrators in clarifying the law, even though it may provide less litigation for lawyers in trying to squeeze their clients into one or another out-of-date category.<br><br>
I confirm that the categories of vehicle that have traditionally used rebated fuel or red diesel will be carried forward in one form or another. In view of the subject's complexity, perhaps I should remind hon. Members that these specialist vehicles are used not only in the agricultural sector, as the hon. Lady implied, but in the construction and public works sectors.<br><br>
As the law stands, entitlement to the use of rebated fuel is tied to the vehicle excise duty category to which the vehicle belongs. As we are removing a huge number of categories, reducing them to nine in number, it follows that we can no longer rely on categorising for VED purposes as a guide to entitlement to rebated fuel. Therefore, in a similar clarifying measure we are defining entitled vehicles as under the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979. The definitions used are very similar to those used by the driver and vehicle licensing agency to define the VED categories. I shall briefly run through them.<br><br>
The entitlements to be carried forward in clause 6 are, first, vehicles are not used on public roads and have no VED licence—in other words, off-road vehicles that never go near public roads. Secondly, trackers will be included and we have agreed an amendment to include in that category track machines for cutting hedges, roadside verges and so on. Tractors used in factories and quarries, which have occasional road use, will also be included, as will agricultural engines. That term covers combine harvesters and the like. The Committee has just agreed to include all-terrain vehicles in that category. Also included are mowing machines, snow ploughs, road gritters and mobile cranes that are used on roads at a site or going to and from the site. Digging machines—commonly known as JCBs—works trucks and road construction vehicles are included.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
The precise treatment of so-called six-miles-a-week vehicles is a matter to be decided on Report. It has been
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
agreed that some farm vehicles had previously been exempt because they travelled fewer than six miles a week on the roads. That criterion definition is more or less unworkable and prone to evasion. We will consider on Report how to provide a similar exemption from VED without excessive bureaucracy. It follows from that that we shall also consider how to carry forward, in some form, the entitlement to rebated fuel.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In clauses 9 and 10 and schedule 3, which we are now discussing, the Government propose to extend duty to games machines as well as to increase the duty on gaming machines where there is a cash prize. I want to deal with the two separate groups of machines; amendments that arise later in the schedule will pick up specific items.<br><br>
The Government propose to introduce a tax on all gaming machines, regardless of whether they pay prizes. For example, video game machines—they are often referred to as games of skill—and pinball machines will be taxed. The Minister was good enough to write to me on 27 January explaining the Government amendments. I shall comment on that again at the end of my remarks.<br><br>
Many Members of Parliament, as well as Members of the Committee, have been extensively lobbied by men and women from small businesses who run companies that supervise the machines. They are distraught at the Government's proposals. They have made representations to the Government—hence some of the amendments—but believe that the amendments do not go far enough. Many of the machines that the Government propose to tax do not raise sufficient revenue in the course of the year to make it viable for the machines to be maintained and run by the companies.<br><br>
The association that represents the businesses in those areas asked a leading accountant to study the implications for its industry of the unamended proposals in the Finance Bill. It believes that there would be a reduction in corporation tax to the Exchequer of 28 per cent., or £10 million a year, from amusement arcades as a direct result of the withdrawal of machines because it would no longer be financially viable to run them.<br><br>
There would be a loss of VAT receipts to the Exchequer of about £45.5 million. There would be a substantial
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
reduction in, for example, video game machines, which the association believes would be reduced by about 60 per cent. It also believes that the number of pinball machines would be reduced by 39 per cent. Most importantly, it claims that as many as 4,600 people could lose their jobs. That would be a loss of revenue to the Treasury—let alone the personal misery and problems caused to the people who could lose their jobs. The association estimates that there could be a loss of £15.8 million, excluding the cost of social security payments to those who would be able to claim benefit. Therefore, for the creation of a revenue income estimated at £30 million the Government are taking steps that will undermine significant parts of the industry. That will be most heavily felt in seaside resorts where many of the machines are located. The distribution of the effect would fall more heavily on those areas that are already experiencing significant employment and tourism problems.<br><br>
The industry recognises that there is a clear case for a proper and fairer tax regime for the machines. It has put to us, and we agree, that the emphasis of taxation should be shifted from game machines—such as pinball, video games and games of skill—and loaded on to games of chance. I do not play these machines so I am having problems in thinking of examples, but one arm bandits, fruit machines and machines that pay out cash prizes are very lucrative not for people who play them, but for the companies that run them.<br><br>
We believe that the Government have incorrectly assessed the ability of the industry to sustain the proposed taxation regime. Our amendments would replace that Government regime with more sensible proposals.<br><br>
The first effect would be to limit the tax on video games and games of skill to a rate of £100 per year instead of the Government's proposal of £250 per year per playing position. I do not know whether you, Mr. Winterton, are familiar with video games with car races, star wars games and so on, but the machines often have more than one playing position so that two or three players can compete. Under the Government's original proposal, each point of access to the machine would be taxed at £250 per year, instead of a total tax of £250 for the machine. We propose that the machine, regardless of playing positions, be taxed at £100. That would still bring a revenue from those machines, but not one as excessive or as difficult for the industry to pay as that originally proposed. The number of players per screen would be irrelevant.<br><br>
Next, we wish to replace the Government's current proposals by weighting the bands for charging towards game machines by introducing a new band of tax on all cash payout machines. This is a complex matter and it is either my good luck or my misfortune to have to get to grips with the Bill—it depends on whether it is late at night or early in the morning. Our amendments propose a new set of bands. Band 1, which would apply to video games, would be £100. Band 2, which would apply to existing fruit machines, would be £535. Band 3 would cover the new all-cash machines—which pay out £15, for example—and that would be £650. Band 4 would be £1,375.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
The Home Office proposes to introduce a new type of adult-only fruit machine with cash payout. If the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0514">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
maximum permitted size is set between £10 and £15 it will replace the current fruit machines. It seems sensible to take that on board now. We propose that the heavy taxation should be on machines that pay out large prize money instead of penalising the smaller machines. In that way there would be a fairer tax regime on the industry. It has said that it could cope with such a tax regime as it would not have the devastating effect that it had anticipated from the original proposals.<br><br>
Until a few days ago many amendments had been tabled by Conservative members of the Committee. They have particular constituency interests and they may wish to develop the argument further on how it affects their constituencies.<br><br>
The Government's amendments do not go far enough. They leave the weight at £250. They do not take account of machines that pay no money at all or are games of skill. They leave the industry under enormous financial pressure. It seems sensible to try to find a tax regime that does not kill off the industry. I hope that the Minister can assure the Committee that that is his intention and that he will look carefully at our amendments before telling the Committee whether he will support them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not often that I find myself in considerable agreement with the Opposition Front Bench and with the hon. Member for Bristol, South. She said that her concerns were shared by many hon. Members who represent constituencies such as mine and which contain a number of amusement arcades. I agree with a number of points that she made. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Paymaster General, who has been extremely responsive to approaches both from me and from hon. Members on both sides of the House who represent constituencies containing large numbers of amusement arcades.<br><br>
The amusement arcades in my constituency are a significant factor in the local economy. They employ many people and they are an important indoor leisure facility that is very much a part of seaside resorts. My hon. Friend the Paymaster General is well aware of that because he also represents a seaside resort, as does my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary. It is fair to say that this issue is well known to many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee and the House.<br><br>
The Government's original proposals caused much consternation. Within an hour of my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor sitting down on the first day of the Budget debate I was fortunate enough to catch Madam Speaker's eye to raise the concerns that I knew would be felt by amusement arcade operators in my constituency. I said that I hoped that the Chancellor and his colleagues on the Treasury Bench would look carefully at the matter again before it came into Committee. My hon. Friend the Paymaster General has received approaches from myself and other hon. Members in the past week. The hon. Member for Bristol, South rightly said that I tabled a number of amendments, which have now been withdrawn, largely because my hon. Friend has given me undertakings, as he will confirm this morning, that further changes will be put forward by the Government on Report.<br><br>
My hon. Friend and his colleagues know that these matters are extremely complex. Detailed amendments could not be put forward by the Government in the short
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
time available before Committee proceedings began. However, I ask my hon. Friend to look beyond what he has said and what he will say later, because a number of factors still will not satisfy those who are involved in this business and will not prevent significant job losses, not only in my constituency but in many others.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bristol, South was right to point to the industry's worry that the Government's proposals, as originally drafted, would have been counterproductive. Had they remained unamended, there would have been a destruction of businesses, significant job losses and significant losses of VAT and corporation tax. However, in responding to those worries my hon. Friend has suggested changes to reduce the adverse effect. I urge him to accept further submissions before the Bill goes to its Report stage. I hope that he will consider them extremely carefully.<br><br>
Despite what my hon. Friend is going to say this morning, the Government are still proposing to tax video games, pinball games and, especially, skill-with-prizes games—they are known in the trade as SWP games, and by us as quiz machines. They are a uniquely British product that has been extremely successful in this country. The Government still propose to tax those machines at £250 a year. Limiting tax in the way that my hon. Friend intends to propose will not offer relief to SWP machines. Given the number of those uniquely British machines that will be made unviable as a result of even the amended proposals, the market will shrink to a size that is economically unsupportable by British manufacturers.<br><br>
Last week an international trade fair was held in London by the British Amusement Catering Trades Association, one of the main trade bodies representing the amusement arcade operators. It was enormously important for the export earnings that the industry produces and a record number of overseas buyers attended. The manufacturers of such machines, the suppliers and the arcade operators should not be hit. The industry, which is a successful export earner and is successful domestically should not be prevented from developing new machines. Many hon. Members will be aware that new technological advances are made with every month that passes. Britain has led, and continues to lead, the world in this business. I ask my hon. Friend to pay particular attention to that when he considers the further submissions that will be made to him.<br><br>
The suggested changes relating to an exemption for 10p or 20p-a-play machines provide only limited help to lower-earning equipment. It will not surprise hon. Members who have young families, as I do, that the £1 coin is the preferred play coin of game players. That may be expensive for parents, but it is a fact of the industry. Most games in arcades offer three games for £1, an effective price per play of 33⅓p. The 20p exemption, which my hon. Friend has suggested he is minded to introduce, will cap the price of play at 20p, which the trade and I argue would stagnate income for the industry's future development and for further reinvestment. Other costs will also increase for arcade operators.<br><br>
It is important to recognise that many arcade operators and many machine suppliers run small businesses, as the hon. Member for Bristol, South made clear. I have received more letters from small operators in my constituency on this issue than on any other since I became a Member of Parliament more than two and a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0515">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
half years ago. Many of the people who have visited my constituency surgery run one-man or husband-and-wife businesses, which operate a small number of machines—one or, at most, two machines in a pub or club. It is important that those individuals' livelihoods are not undermined. My hon. Friend the Paymaster General is aware of that. He has tried to deal with those anxieties, but I hope that he will be able to go further.<br><br>
The proposals that will be considered on Report will require complex legislative wording. There will be further administrative difficulties for Customs and Excise, which will collect the duty. The trade proposals would make its life easier. I know that my hon. Friend will consult his officials in Customs and Excise. He will also receive further representations from the trade associations. The other main trade association is the British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions. It has taken a similar stance to that of the British Amusement Catering Trades Association. Further suggestions will be made to Customs and Excise about how to amend the proposals to raise money for the Treasury. That goes beyond the Government's original proposal.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Bristol, South said, it is right to acknowledge that the trade has adopted a responsible position. The trade does not suggest that there should be no further tax. It has recognised that it has to bite the bullet and accept that there will be new taxes. It has commissioned Pannell Kerr Forster, an internationally renowned firm of accountants, to examine the Government's proposals and devise alternative proposals that will raise revenue in a way that is sustainable for large and small operators, without destroying the seaside economies. Seaside resorts, such as my constituency, and especially their small businesses, are susceptible to damage. I do not wish to see boarded-up arcades, empty shop premises or a reduction in the facilities of our great seaside resorts. I know that the Chief Secretary and the Paymaster General share that view. Towns like Blackpool—the greatest seaside resort in Europe—depend on the survival of those businesses. I hope that my hon. Friends will take those matters seriously.<br><br>
The proposals that my hon. Friend the Paymaster General has suggested that he will accept on Report constitute a good start. Those who operate the arcades are grateful to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. However, the Government's proposals will not sufficiently alleviate the problem. To limit the tax to video games, skill-with-prizes and pinball machines would remove from the duty net only a small number of machines, such as novelty equipment, cranes and redemption machines. They constitute 15,000 out of 156,000 newly taxable machines. Skill-with-prizes machines are offered no relief.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Paymaster General will consider our anxieties and examine carefully the trade proposals—alternatives that provide simple definitions and easier administration for Customs and Excise, as well as the relief, which the Government acknowledge is necessary for the future health of the industry. The proposals will not only help to ensure the survival of Britain's traditional seaside resorts and their arcades, which are a vital part of those resorts, but will generate significant tax revenue.<br><br>
The Home Office has suggested that it will introduce a higher-value machine. The Home Secretary issued a press
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
release about that before Christmas. I hope that the Paymaster General will take the opportunity offered by the Bill to adapt the law to take account of the higher-value machines. I hope that he and his colleagues will respond to the proposals in further meetings and on Report.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: To follow the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Hawkins) on this issue is rather interesting. He has made some powerful points which I do not intend to repeat. Nevertheless, there are not only important issues relating to the industry but issues of principle concerning taxation and how it is applied to the industry.<br><br>
Sections of the industry have described the proposals as amazing. I agree with them. Of course all hon. Members are lobbied by different industries and whether one is prepared to accept what they say is a matter of judgment. The information that I have received from the industry has persuaded me that it is not crying wolf. It has described the Government's proposals as amazing because it cannot understand why a Government who are always criticising tax proposals and their effects on jobs seem determined to implement tax proposals that will undoubtedly have a detrimental effect on jobs.<br><br>
If hon. Members study the information and take as wide and objective a view as possible of the proposals, I fail to see how they could come to any other conclusion. I am advised that First Leisure is already scaling down its operation and purchasing as a direct result of the proposals. There is a strong case to justify the assertion that the proposals will definitely cost jobs in British industry.<br><br>
I have no intention of repeating the valid points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South about the effect of the proposals on the total tax take. If this is a proposal that is designed to increase revenue for the Exchequer, it will almost certainly do the opposite. If we consider the loss of direct tax from employees who may lose their jobs and VAT from machines that will not be used it is likely that the tax take from the proposals will come nowhere near the Treasury's anticipated amount.<br><br>
I shall now deal with what I consider to be two issues of principle relating to the proposals, which go to the crux of the matter. The first is whether a game of skill should be taxed in its entirety, as is a game in which there is a cash prize. As I understand the proposals, they will result in a skill quiz game, under the current format, being taxed at the same rate as a jackpot gaming machine. The Paymaster General is shaking his head—I hope that that indicates that what I have said is incorrect. If so, it will be clarified when he replies, but that is how I understand the present position and, if it is the case, clearly it is a nonsense. I hope that when the hon. Gentleman responds, that matter will be clarified and, if the proposals will result in the serious anomaly that I have described, they will not be pursued.<br><br>
The second point that concerns me is the fact that the Government are offering concessions. One hears that word used often and we heard it last night in the Committee of the whole House. I am dubious about the word "concession", because its meaning depends upon the original proposals. It is possible to propose an unfair, swingeing level of taxation; then, after listening to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0516">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
arguments and recognising the reaction, to come forward with different and perhaps less onerous proposals and describe them, as the Paymaster General has done—and no doubt will do so again today—as concessions.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Blackpool, South has responded adequately to that possibility. It is one thing for the Government to say that they are prepared, in the light of the arguments, to offer concessions; the question is whether those concessions adequately deal with the issues and whether they deal with the principles that the tax proposals were designed to pursue. We must be extremely careful—although we wait with baited breath for the further amendments to which the hon. Member for Blackpool, South referred and which we hope the Paymaster General will reveal, perhaps before Report.<br><br>
Our amendment contains another important principle. It would move the burden of the tax proposals away from purely skill-game use to games that pay cash prizes. That is a sensible way forward and I am advised that the industry thinks so. The issue is a technical and complicated one and hon. Members will consider the technical details, but we should keep at the front of our minds the principles of the existing proposals. An important matter of principle has been identified, which may or may not be dealt with by the previous comments of the hon. Member for Blackpool, South or by the further changes—concessions—that the Paymaster General may present later. While any Government move along the lines that have been suggested is welcome, the Committee should deal with the two matters that form a continuous thread through the proposals. Our amendments would tackle those principles and we hope that the Paymaster General will accept them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the distinction should be between machines that require a degree of skill and those that pay prizes, because some of those that require skill pay prizes, too. The distinction, if there is to be one, should be between machines that require some skill and those that operate entirely by luck or good fortune.<br><br>
Amusement machine licence duty will be a useful source of new revenue for the Treasury. It seems sensible to tax the machines, which perhaps do not provide a particularly desirable form of activity. If there is to be a new tax it is clearly important to ensure that it is pitched at a level to maximise the yield. The present proposals appear likely, through the burden of tax, to eliminate some of the activities concerned. My amendments would ensure that amusement machines that became liable for the new duty would be taxed only at the lowest rate and that those with more than one playing position would be taxed only as one machine.<br><br>
I tabled the amendments only at the end of last week and I thank my hon. Friend the Paymaster General for responding to them so soon. I know that he intends to table his own amendments to deal with those matters. As a result, only video machines, quiz machines and pinball machines will be covered. The rate of duty on all those machines will be limited to £250. Only a single licence duty will be payable on any of those machines with more than one playing position, but with only one screen.<br><br>
I am very pleased that my hon. Friend has responded in that way because, with any new tax, it is important to ensure that it is pitched at a level that will maximise the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
yield. It should not drive people out of business or drive machines out of pubs or whatever. That clearly was not the intention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Liddell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: A number of questions relating to the schedule are bothering me. It is not only an issue for those Members of Parliament who have coastal constituencies; those of us who have constituencies with very little in the way of leisure facilities find that the machines are a valuable source of leisure, although I must admit to having some reservations about their use. There is another aspect in that they provide much-needed revenue for many organisations in the voluntary sector, from the British Legion to working men's clubs. Indeed, many political parties find themselves financed from the revenue from such machines. I am concerned about the impact on all those organisations.<br><br>
I must confess that, having heard the hon. Member for Blackpool, South, I am amazed at his generosity. In my neck of the woods—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I suggest that the hon. Member for Blackpool, South listens to the hon. Lady who has just mentioned him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton. I was about to compliment the hon. Member for Blackpool, South on his generosity, given that he seems to think that children will be satisfied with a £1 coin to operate the machines. In my neck of the woods, that would be a level of generosity multiplied by five: 20p tends to be the going rate in the west of Scotland.<br><br>
I am concerned about the revenue likely to be generated from the tax, given the impact on the elasticity of demand for the use of the machines. If there will be a 60 to 70 per cent. reduction in the availability of the machines, as has been suggested by those in the industry, the revenue to the Exchequer may not be of a scale that is appropriate to the nature of the legislation.<br><br>
I am concerned about the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South made about the loss of employment in the industry. Pannell Kerr Forster has estimated a loss of around 4,500 jobs. That is extremely disturbing because many of those jobs will be in areas of high unemployment. There is a suggestion that Sega, the major Japanese games manufacturer, is questioning the future of its investment policy in the United Kingdom as a result of this duty. I would be interested to know if Conservative Members could give us guidance on whether they are aware from other Departments whether that will happen.<br><br>
Generally, I am impressed by the arguments put to me by the industry and I would be interested in the Government's response to the fact that the tax will affect an industry that currently provides 125,000 jobs. It is not a minor part of our economy: it generates £875 million in Government revenue. Although I am concerned about the impact to the Exchequer in relation to the elasticity of demand, I am even more concerned about the impact on voluntary organisations that depend on the machines to generate much-needed revenue. I will be interested in the Paymaster General's response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to add some questions to those already put to the Paymaster General
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0517">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
by my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, East. I hope that there have been studies that indicate whether the proposal is sensible in terms of giving added revenue to the Treasury. I wonder whether the Paymaster General could tell us what studies have been undertaken to look at the impact on corporation tax revenues and the loss thereof, which the industry claims that it is having from the proposals and the extent to which it would occur. Equally, I should be interested to know what studies have been undertaken to show the impact on the loss of VAT revenues that could occur if the Bill's proposals go ahead.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
The industry is also claiming that the introduction of those proposals will also bring an increase in unemployment. Clearly that would also have an impact on the Government's finances and I should like the Paymaster General to tell us what the impact is likely to be on various social security budgets from the potential increase in unemployment of 4,700, which is what the industry has said will occur.<br><br>
I should also be interested to know whether any study has looked at the impact of the proposals over time. It could well be that there would be an increase in revenue to the Treasury in year one but that years two, three, four and five would bring a loss of revenue because of the adverse impact that the industry has described. I should like to know whether work has been done in that area and whether we have any idea of the Treasury's view on the future impact of the proposals.<br><br>
I heard with interest the speech of the hon. Member for Blackpool, South. I come from an inner-city constituency but the little local high streets of my constituency are probably not dissimilar to those in the constituencies of many hon. Members here. We have seen the growth of superstores outside the centre of cities and supermarkets, and a lot of the small shops that keep the centres of our cities going have been turned over to amusement arcades. I am concerned that if the proposals go ahead they will have an adverse impact not only in seaside areas but will lead to further decline of many of our inner-city town centres where small shops are an essential ingredient in bringing people together in the centre of the community and sustaining a fragile sense of civic identity and community which is so important in our inner-city areas.<br><br>
Again perhaps the Paymaster General might let us know whether any studies have been undertaken into the impact not only on the seaside resorts but on the industry in inner-city and other areas where there is a concentration of residential population and a consequent potential demand for gaming machines. Like those of my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, East, my children are rarely given £1 to spend per machine but will willingly go in and spend 20p coins if I give them five of those.<br><br>
I wish also to consider the proposal as it relates to the Government's intention to encourage the growth of small businesses and the Government's local and economic regeneration proposals. Small businesses will be hit by this proposition and, at a time when we all recognise that if the economic growth and prosperity that we all desire is to come about it will be through the encouragement of small businesses, it seems that there is a contradiction
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
between intent and action on the Government's behalf in advancing these proposals. Clearly, if we want small businesses to prosper in this area, we should not be giving them an unfair set of taxation policies. Has any work been done to look at the impact of that?<br><br>
In considering regional economic prosperity, particularly with regard to our tourist industry, we hope that much of our prosperity in future will come from a growth in tourism. Clearly, it is the Government's duty therefore to establish a framework that will encourage the private sector to do all that it can to take advantage of growth in leisure and tourism. Clearly it is the Government's duty therefore to establish a framework that will encourage the private sector to do all that it can to take advantage of growth in leisure and tourism. It is therefore odd that the Bill contains a proposal that will damage the tourist potential of many of our seaside areas, and parts of the centres of many of our major cities which we are also trying to develop as tourist attractions.<br><br>
Members of the Committee have received representations from the British Tourist Authority. I should like to hear from the Paymaster General about the discussions that he has had with the tourist authorities. Has he looked at the wider implications for that economic prosperity and economic development based on tourism that we wish to encourage?<br><br>
Finally, the role of Government in our general economic strategy is to foster those industries where we are developing a world leader role. It would be odd, if as a world leader in the skills with prizes machines, we took action that could kill off the potential growth not just within the British economy but as a potential export and therefore earner for British industry. At the same time, if we are trying to encourage inward investment, it is odd that some of the proposals before us mean that companies that could be inward investors such as Sega are reconsidering whether it is sensible to proceed.<br><br>
I share the concerns of many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee that this proposition may have been put forward to provide short-term Treasury benefit without proper thought having been given to the longer-term impact both on revenues to the Exchequer and on jobs, prosperity and growth in some key areas of the country and in some key sectors of the economy. I hope that all hon. Members who take part in the debate today take heed of the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South and that her amendment is given serious consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the observations that have been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). It is important to have balance in these proposals and that we do not kill the goose that lays the golden egg. Clearly there is a point at which taxation will produce diminishing returns to the Treasury. I therefore hope that the Treasury will look sympathetically on those amendments.<br><br>
Representing probably the largest seaside resort in the United Kingdom, I am well aware that amusement arcades and machines make an important contribution to the economy of such towns. But some of the speeches that have been inspired by the trade have somewhat overegged the pudding on the employment side. In my constituency we provide all sorts of indoor entertainment: indoor sports, theatres, pop concerts, clubs and pubs.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0518">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
Every pound that is put into a fruit machine is one that perhaps will not be spent on those other activities which may themselves be more labour intensive than the operations of an amusement arcade.<br><br>
A balance needs to be struck. We must not kill off the amusement industry because it is important both to the amusement of those who come to our resorts and from the manufacturing point of view. It is important to achieve the right balance and ensure that, while not killing the goose that lays the golden egg, we do not exaggerate the likely impact of the proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Pearson, who is an active rugby player. He plays for a team against which I played many years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish briefly to make three points: on the fairness, the economics and the practicality and enforceability of the proposals.<br><br>
In the context of fairness, as a matter of principle I know of no compelling reason why the duty on amusements machines with cash prizes should be different from the duty on video games and machines without cash prizes. Both are gaming machines and so are a legitimate leisure activity that can attract taxation.<br><br>
There have been some good speeches about the economics of the proposals. The options for a business would seem to be either to absorb totally the additional costs of the duty—thereby, I assume, reducing profit levels—or to pass on those additional costs to the consumer, the end user.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should bear in mind the fact that, with many such machines, it is simply not possible for the arcade operator or the supplier or manufacturer of the machines to pass on an increase in duty to the ultimate consumer. That is because of how the limitations on the manufacture of new coinage receipt facilities in the machines are determined, the cost involved and the fact that it is not possible precisely to pass on a tax at a VAT percentage. The cost to the consumer would rise to such a level that it would deter people either from having a game in their pub, club or arcade or from playing a game.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that point and its relevance to small businesses, a matter on which I shall comment when I discuss practicality and enforceability.<br><br>
On the one hand there is a requirement to absorb costs and, on the other hand, in big businesses there is potential to pass on those additional costs. As my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) rightly said, the likely effects will very much depend on the price elasticity of demand of the industry. Between those two poles there is scope for different options and business strategies in the larger companies. Indeed, a significant part of the industry is dominated by some large organisations that have been quite effective in lobbying.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) mentioned the relative lack of information on the likely effects of this legislation. I am slightly nervous that the lobbying on these provisions has been very much one-way and that we are receiving extremely partial information.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
I am not totally convinced that there are unlikely to be significant economic effects in terms of job losses, as was mentioned earlier, as a result of the duties. If there is less demand for video machines, perhaps we should ask ourselves whether it is necessarily bad for some young people—it is young people who tend to use them—spend less time on such machines. In economic terms, we must consider the displacement effect and on what young people would then spend their time and money. It might be on a more worthwhile and labour-intensive activity, thereby eliminating potential job consequences.<br><br>
I am also not convinced by arguments about the effect of the new provisions on the international competitive advantages from which the gaming industry currently benefits. Making the home market relatively less attractive to imports could solidify it, and would also provide an incentive for our gaming industry to become more competitive and efficient.<br><br>
Examples from more competitive and liberalised industries demonstrate that they can provide a spur to increasing competitive advantage, thereby increasing the ability and capacity of companies to export further and more successfully.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that the hon. Gentleman has not perhaps fully taken into account is that British manufacturers lead the world, as I said earlier. Any damage that is done to the domestic market reduces the opportunity for British manufacturers to innovate. It is not the case of preventing imports, but of risking damage to British manufacturers and limiting their opportunity to innovate and, therefore, to export even more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pearson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced that increasing taxation will limit the ability of domestic manufacturers to innovate. I agree that in a number of areas we lead the world, particularly video game machines. I am well aware of companies such as Centregold, which is midlands-based.<br><br>
My final point is about the practicality and enforceability of the proposals. I am not totally convinced that I understand how some of the definitions will work in practice.<br><br>
I am willing to be corrected, but understand that no distinction is being made between video machines that require coinage to be put in them and computer machines with CD-Rom that can carry the same sort of games but which might be put in a special location, with an administration charge paid to enter. That would constitute a small computer centre with an entry fee, which would not be caught by the Bill, whereas individual coin-operated machines would be. That is a potential anomaly and I would welcome comment on it.<br><br>
We are making decisions, but insufficient research has been carried out into the Bill's likely effects. I am minded to support some of the Bill's broad principles but I am worried about the detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Shaw <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My constituency, like those of other hon. Members, will be affected by the impact of the duty, which has worried my constituents. It is helpful that the Government are listening, and prepared to consider amendments and, perhaps, further improvements.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0519">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
Hon. Members will be concerned about the comments about an industry in which Britain specialises and leads in many cases. I take the point of the hon. Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson) about what might be termed "edutainment". More and more, there is an element of education in methods of entertainment involving video. It would be bad news for the country for us to be leading the world in developing such a form of entertainment, only to tax it in a way that would discourage its development. I support the arguments for ensuring that the way in which the duty impacts is fair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Hoon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ashfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman give the Committee an example of a machine which has a specific educational benefit?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the way in which the industry is developing. Multi-media is a new expression for the direction in which the industry is taking off. There are a number of ways in which the industry will develop in the future that it has not achieved so far. The technology and the software are capable of being used in an educational manner and that will be done increasingly in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend consider that the increasing use of quiz machines, which often have significant prizes for those who can answer general knowledge questions, are also of educational value, particularly for children who need to develop quickly their general knowledge?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shaw</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point that my hon. Friend has just made and to which he referred in his speech earlier on. That was at the back of my mind when I spoke.<br><br>
The multimedia industry and entertainment related to it offer this country a tremendous opportunity. I hope that the Government will bear in mind, when working out how duties of this nature will impact, that we should do nothing to discourage the industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with interest to the debate and wonder why we are at this stage. Before presenting their proposals one would have thought that the Government would consult with the industry concerned but that does not seem to be the case. The association has regulated itself well in the past because of the concerns of many about gaming machines and, in particular, their effect on young children. It is entirely legitimate for the association to point the Government in the right direction because, as we heard earlier, there is a danger of killing the golden goose. The Government will not receive the revenue that they expect from an industry that will be depressed by the measures.<br><br>
We must not underestimate the impact on the industry in our communities. Like the hon. Member for Blackpool, South, I feel that there will be a great impact on jobs. As my hon. Friends have said, there are many amusement arcades even in constituencies that are not on the sea front, and particularly in town centres where they attract visitors. The validity of that issue is in question and will be in question in the wider debate about the effects of the measures.<br><br>
I am concerned that the Government have brought forward the measures without consultation. Will the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
Minister comment on what consultation has taken place? Was it merely written correspondence between Ministers and the industry or were there detailed meetings about the effects?<br><br>
The wider point about the educational value of new technology should not be missed. With the development of computer technology, the very fact that youngsters play computer games is an educational advantage. I hope that the Ministers take on board the views of the industry and those of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee who have given a great deal of thought to the issue, perhaps more thought than the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor made it clear in his Budget speech last November that the coverage of taxation must keep pace with developments in the world of gaming and amusement machines. That is why he proposed widening the gaming machine licence duty to cover certain new machines such as arcade video machines. He felt that it was anomalous that we should tax amusement machines with prizes but not those without. We remain of the view that it is appropriate to raise a duty on some of those machines. Since the Budget speech, we have listened carefully to the industry, to the trade bodies that represent it and to several of my hon. Friends and other hon. Members, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South, who has been energetic in making representations and in bringing the trade together. That has enabled us to find out how matters stand in the trade and the possible consequences of the tax. The industry has generally accepted that some of its machines can afford to bear a licence cost, while others cannot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way later if I fail to cover the point that the hon. Lady is concerned about in my general remarks.<br><br>
I am thinking of the high-tech machines that are easily to be found in arcades and leisure centres such as the one that I visited the weekend before last. I, too, have a local seaside resort where there is an arcade at the end of a short pier. I know exactly what my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South and other members of the Committee mean when they talk about the strictly recreational seaside end of the business. As extra field work I visited a much larger leisure centre in London, using my children as a cover. It was one of the most expensive afternoons that I have ever spent. Many of the machines are not the end-of-the-pier machines familiar from our youth but are high-tech machines, often with £1-a-go play. I am told that some machines cost more than £20,000 and I consider it reasonable for them to bear a new duty of £250 a year. I watched some of them in action and they were taking enough money in the first hour of the play easily to cover the proposed weekly licence duty of £4.80.<br><br>
I readily concede that the high-tech machines are at one end of the spectrum and can bear duty, but that other machines cannot. That is why we have taken into account representations made by seaside operators and others who provide a mix of entertainment, often aimed at families, so that besides playing the strictly gaming machines, people can amuse themselves with cheaper machines or on those directed at younger family members. We are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0520">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
therefore persuaded that several concessions should be made. I stress that the duty does not come into effect until 1 November 1995, which give the industry time to adjust to it.<br><br>
Some of the amendments on the Amendment Paper today are extremely complex. We are, after all, dealing with a technological industry and therefore we need correct definitions. When the amendments necessary to achieve most of the concessions that I intend to make have been drafted, it is right that they should be shown to the industry to allow it to comment before they are tabled on Report.<br><br>
The first adjustment is to make it clear that we will tax the new machines that are to be brought within the scope of duty for the first time at the lowest rate of £250 a year. That is important because as the measure stands the quiz machines that have been mentioned in the debate would fall into the higher gaming machine rate. After all, they are played not just to test the skill and knowledge of the operator, but for money. The payout of the machines often exceeds £6; it can be between £10 and £20. If we do not specify otherwise, they might be thought to fall naturally into the higher bands of £535 or £1,375, which apply to gaming machines or one arm bandits, as they used to be called.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
To be clear, all of the new machines that will come within the scope of the new duty for the first time will in no case be taxed at the higher rates, but will be confined to the £250 rate. I believe that that answers one of the points raised by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson).<br><br>
The second point I wish to stress answers the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and it is to make it clear that machines with more than one playing position will be treated as only one machine. Provided that that is not abused by attempts to use it to avoid duty in future, I think that that is a fair settlement. We are dealing with a responsible industry, but if any part of it were to try to lower the rate of duty artificially we should be bound to take action.<br><br>
My third point is that the seasonal concession for gaming machines, which gives an eight-month licence for the price of six, will be available for the new machines as well. There are amendments to that effect which we may consider later this morning.<br><br>
Next, all new machines except quiz machines that can be played for any amount not exceeding 20p will be exempt from duty. That point is most important because it is estimated that possibly 85 per cent. of all the machines in existence therefore fall outside the scope of the new duty. The hon. Member for Barking referred to the fact that many of the machines with which she is familiar are played for low stakes of 10p or 20p. That is correct and they will fall outside the scope of the new duty. That also answers the point raised by the hon. Member for Monklands, East about machines in voluntary organisations, clubs and so on. Generally speaking, especially if those clubs are for young people, they do not have high-play, high-tech machines, but often pinball tables or video machines which take a low stake of 10p or 20p. They will be entirely exempt from the duty. Machines which are often found in seaside environments, where
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
people are setting up family entertainments, will not come within the duty requirement.<br><br>
Quiz machines which are denned as skill-with-prizes machines will remain within the duty for stakes greater than 5p and so will not be exempted if they require only 10p or 20p to play. The reason is that they pay cash prizes and are therefore more akin to gaming machines rather than amusement machines such as videos. I stress again that the duty will be limited to the lowest rate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little puzzled because some of the more sophisticated machines encourage players to continue to put in more money. One does not actually finish a game but pays 50p to go so far into it, then another 50p to continue. The difficulty with the way in which the Minister is putting his argument is that that would not prevent the industry from configuring machines to take, for example, a series of 20p pieces. How does the Minister propose to deal with that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That touches on the point made by the hon. Member for Bradford, South about some machines that may not play by coin at all. That is why schedule 3(6)(1) states that the player plays
<br><blockquote><p>"by inserting a coin or token into the machine or in some other way".</p></blockquote>
It is true that if operators choose to downgrade the stake that their machines take, provided they are not skill-with-prizes machines, they will be exempted from duty. I think that that will be a welcome concession.<br><br>
The total revenue from the new duty, with our proposed amendments, will be in the region of £15 million in a full year. We have examined the impact on our fiscal projections from the adjustment to other taxes and the trade produced some information on that. If the VAT take from a machine was to decrease, it may mean that that particular part of the arcade would not be collecting and passing on VAT at the previous rate, but it does not follow that the VAT is lost to Customs and Excise altogether. If there is an absence of a skills-with-prizes machine or video machine in a club or pub, the money may very well be spent on another gaming machine so that the actual revenue to the Government could increase or that money could be spent in the bar, in which case VAT and excise duties could rise. The overall revenue to the Government is not necessarily the same as the revenue passed on to Customs and Excise by owners of the particular machines affected by the duty.<br><br>
With those clarifications, I hope that I have shown members of the Committee that we have moved a long way to meet the industry's concerns. With a new tax-raising proposal, I do not suppose that it is ever possible to satisfy everyone. After all, no one likes paying tax and it is right that they should resist taxation. I think that the proposals I have meet the chief concerns. We shall be studying further the detailed provisions and drafting. I shall make those available to hon. Members as required in order to turn the general proposals into specific ones in time for them to be considered by the House on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Paymaster General for giving way and, in particular, for what he has just said about further opportunities for discussion and for members of the Committee and others to study the proposals. I want to ask one specific point of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0521">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
further clarification, which I know my hon. Friend will be happy to give.<br><br>
Concern has been expressed, which I have passed on to my hon. Friend, by the operators of museums that have antique machines, which are quite often of interest to visitors. I appreciate that what my hon. Friend said about taking 10p and 20p play machines out of the net will probably cover my point. Would he be happy to confirm that his further amendments will take account of antique gaming machines? In some museums, those machines use old-fashioned penny pieces, which are sold to visitors. One example is the Lakeland motor museum. Will my hon. Friend confirm that those machines will not be covered by taxation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am familiar with that point because I was present when the penny arcade was opened at the Wookey Hole caves in my constituency. It operates in the way that my hon. Friend suggests—it exchanges a sum of money for an old penny, which the player inserts into the machine. That would fall within the 10p and 20p exemption. If I am wrong on this point, I shall return to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two issues arise from the Minister's response. If the proposed legislation omits the 10p and 20p play machines from the tax, what is there to stop the industry from converting all its machines to cheaper models? Have you looked at that issue?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have not looked at any issue, but the Paymaster General may have considered it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hodge</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall learn the conventions; thank you, Mr. Winterton, for correcting me.<br><br>
Has the Paymaster General examined the implications of people converting their machines to take only 10p or 20p? He did not respond to the point about potential job losses in the industry and their impact on general revenues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing to stop the industry downgrading a machine that takes £1 to accepting 10p or 20p. Something similar already happens. A sophisticated video machine may begin in the Acton bowling centre at £1 a go, but by the time it reaches Burnham-on-Sea pavilion in my constituency, it may cost only 10p or 20p to play it. That is legitimate. If the trade wished to remove some high-play machines to qualify for the low-play exemption, that would be a commercial matter for the trade.<br><br>
I am convinced that the amendments that we have made or propose will not cause the massive layoffs and redundancies that members of the Committee perhaps feared when the raw proposals were first published. The overall financial and economic impact of the new tax on revenue and employment is acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate on gaming machines has become complex. The Paymaster General said that he would table further amendments on Report. However, he did not explain what the amendments would contain. That information could help our deliberations. It would assist us to decide whether to vote on these amendments.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
The Paymaster General has given the Committee an undertaking to return to the issues that we have discussed. He also gave the Committee of the whole House an undertaking last night to reconsider vehicle excise duty on the small islands of Britain. Yet the Government Whips pushed it to a vote. We are a little apprehensive after last night and about the breaking down of the trust that a Committee requires to make progress. We cannot accept information at face value.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) that we must not overegg the pudding. International comparisons need to be augmented with more detailed information about the industry before we make sweeping claims. The hon. Gentleman also said that we should not kill the goose that lays the golden egg. No member of the Committee disputes that we need a sensible taxation regime for gaming machines. While some members venture to suggest that such machines may have an educational value, I have yet to see one. A slight snobbery is, perhaps, emerging in Committee in attitudes to gaming machines. I may be guilty of that as I am not a fan of them. I would not give my son 10p to play on them, let alone 20p or £1. That is my personal attitude towards those machines, which many people share.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
We need a sensible taxation system, but that has not been provided. The Paymaster General admitted that the Government's first stab, as I believe he called it, at legislation—an interesting concept for the Bill—was not quite right. After discussions with the industry, some Government amendments were tabled, and they are before us today, and there will be others. Will the hon. Gentleman give us details of those? How was it calculated that the machines could tolerate the proposed levels of taxation? What assessments were made of the total annual take of the machines? What samples were taken? Clearly, the Government did not consult the industry beforehand, hence the current intense lobbying. What market research was undertaken to indicate how much a machine took in a year and thus what a reasonable level of taxation would be? Will the hon. Gentleman clarify his brief comments in his previous speech on the implications for employment and the possible loss of jobs?<br><br>
Through its representations, the industry is trying to advance its cause, as everyone would admit. But in that respect it is no different from any other body—for example, the farmers who have intensely and, so far, successfully lobbied the Government.<br><br>
So that we may make progress and scrutinise in Committee the Government's intentions, we must ask the Paymaster General to be more specific. He gave a complex verbal explanation that was difficult to follow. Perhaps he would consider circulating to the Committee a more detailed explanatory note of the Government's objectives in such taxation, the specific instruments that they intend to use for that purpose, the monitoring that will take place to ascertain whether the tax levels have been correctly set and, finally, clear definitions of each group of machines, which are crucial before we can make judgments about taxation. Without that information, which underpins the Bill, it is difficult to know how we can discharge our duties honestly and fairly as a Committee in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0522">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
scrutinising the Bill. Will the hon. Gentleman give those undertakings and, in the few minutes left in this sitting, try to explain in more detail his thoughts on the sort of amendments that he will introduce on Report?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to be helpful, but I am not sure that I can do much more to explain the duty as we envisage it. I tried to explain specifically—and, I hoped, in terms that would be understood by those without a detailed knowledge of the industry—exactly what we are taxing and those parts of the industry that we are not taxing. At first digestion, it may be rather a heavy meal. Members of the Committee should read the <i>Official Report</i> because I covered fairly comprehensively the parts in which I envisage changes. I also undertook that the detailed and specific amendments, which will give effect to the proposal, will be exposed to the industry and to hon. Members who want to comment on them. I can do no more than that, and am happy to repeat the commitment.<br><br>
I agree that we must get the definitions right; they are complex and particular definitions that distinguish certain types of machine from others are needed. All of that will be turned into statute law by draft amendment.<br><br>
I endeavoured to answer the question of the yield of the tax in my earlier remarks. I gave an estimated yield that was based on work, on the number of machines in each category, which is known to Customs and Excise because of the existing duty requirement. I also gave the figures for non-taxed machines, which are in the public domain and available from the industry.<br><br>
The figures were not plucked from the air and, in making their projections and assessing the economic and financial consequences of the Bill, the Government drew up specific figures. I have told the Committee the overall yield. After hearing those assurances, I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret that, in the absence of the information that we require, we have to press the amendment to a vote. We can do nothing else. It is regrettable that we have not managed to find common ground and a sensible way to proceed on a complex matter that the Committee wants to be dealt with sensibly.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 49, in page 161, line 21, at end insert—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"() An amusement machine is a gaming machine for the purposes of this Act if—
<ol>
<li>it is a prize machine;</li>
<li>the game which is played by means of the machine is a game of chance, a game of chance and skill combined or a pretended game of chance or of chance and skill combined; and</li>
<li>the outcome of the game is determined by the chances inherent in the action of the machine, whether or not provision is made for manipulation of the machine by a player;</li></ol>
and for the purposes of this subsection a game in which the elements of chance can be overcome by skill shall be treated as a game of chance and skill combined if there is an element of chance in the game that cannot be overcome except by superlative skill.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendment No. 50.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned earlier that we will be extending the seasonal concession to the new machines coming into duty. The seasonal concession is familiar to the trade for some existing gaming machines. It will give them an eight-month licence for the price of six and it is particularly useful in those parts of the country where trade is of a seasonable nature, particularly where it is holiday trade. Amendment No. 49 will add a new subsection to schedule 3(6) which defines a gaming machine as a category of amusement machine. Amendment No. 50 replaces schedule 3(10)(4)(a) and (b) with the new wording which now provides that a seasonal licence can be granted for all amusement machines except gaming machines which are not small prize machines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The trade, particularly amusement arcade operators in my constituency, welcome the amendment. The seasonal licence is important and I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Arcade operators in my constituency and in other constituencies will welcome what he has said.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 58, in page 161, line 31, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1C) A machine will not be treated as an amusement machine for the purposes of this Act if it falls within the categories of—
<ol>
<li>a pinball machine, or</li>
<li>a crane grab machine, or</li>
<li>a novelty or fun machine</li></ol>
unless these fall within the category of prize machines as defined in section 22".</p></blockquote>
This amendment would remove certain categories of machines from the taxation band in the Finance Bill, namely pinball machines, crane grab machines and novelty or fun machines. The case has not been made by the Government for extending taxation to those categories and we seek to amend the Bill for the reason given in the debate on the previous amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to take out of the new duty a number of machines which will not be taxed. The crane grab machine and novelty or fun machine will not be taxed and the amendment is unnecessary. Pinball machines will be covered by the duty, but I remind the Committee that if the stake for playing the machine is 10p or 20p, which is frequently the case, the machines will not be taxed.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0523">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From my extensive knowledge of pinball machines, I can assure the Minister that the difficulty with the way in which the Government are proposing the tax is that pinball machines vary enormously in the stake paid for playing a single game. Some machines may take 20p for a single game, others may need 50p for three games and the more sophisticated machines might take £1 for five games. In effect, the Government's proposal does not mean much to what might be defined as the stake because the configuration of particular machines can be adjusted to a wide variety of different arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The concept of exemption for a small stake is quite familiar within the industry. For instance, many gaming machines played for prizes are exempt if the stake is only 5p. Although the hon. Gentleman is quite right to draw attention to the wide variety of machines available and, undoubtedly, to the ingenuity of the industry in seeking to avoid tax, I think, nevertheless, that the exemptions that I have made are fair and workable and that the trade will co-operate with them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to say again how much arcade operators and others will welcome what my hon. Friend the Paymaster General has said about the crane and novelty machines not being within the tax net. It is right to say that, even on the revised proposals that he has indicated he will bring forward later, some higher-value-play pinball machines will still be taxed. I would be grateful if he would say whether he would be prepared to listen to further representations from the industry, including from my constituency and from hon. Members who do not sit on the Committee, but have an interest in the business, about whether pinball machines should continue to be taxed if they have a high value play.<br><br>
Finally, I acknowledge the expertise of the hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon) in these matters. It is clear to me and perhaps to others that the hon. Gentleman will in future be known as the pinball wizard of the Labour Benches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am learning a great deal about hon. Members and their wizardry on pinball tables and knowledge of the industry. Of course, I will listen to anything that is put to me by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South about the detail of the proposals, but I have made some fair concessions this morning, as I hope he will agree. I do not intend to move substantially from what I have said, but if anomalies or details that have been overlooked are brought to my attention, I and my Department will consider them before we table detailed proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a simple question. Given that I have not had a misspent youth and am not terribly knowledgeable about pool tables, will they be included in the scope of the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is said that expertise at pool is evidence of a misspent youth. Pool tables will not be covered by the new duty so there will be more youths misspending their time.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why will pinball machines be included if pool machines are not? Is that a new back-to-basics campaign that the official Opposition have somehow missed? Misspent youth playing pool appears to be okay, while being a pinball wizard apparently confines one to the Opposition Benches, at least for the time being though not, we hope, for much longer. The logic of the proposals escapes me.<br><br>
The theme that appeared to run through the Paymaster General's remarks was that the Government wanted to tax those machines, but if his hon. Friends wanted a private meeting he would bring forward amendments at a later stage. However, the rest of the Committee would not be privy to the discussions and scrutiny of a simple, straightforward matter. Perhaps I should rephrase that because there has been nothing simple and straightforward about this morning's discussions.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Minister for pointing out our fallibility with regard to the amendment. In our defence, I would say that that shows how difficult it is to work through the legislation. With regard to the schedule, the Opposition need the equivalent of a structure—perhaps a game—which would show that if the Government do "A" to the system of taxation on entertainment machines, that will filter through the system and give us "B", the outcome which is the impact on the industry and the likely revenue to the Government. No doubt if the game could be copyrighted the Government could find out how to tax that as well.<br><br>
Nothing that the Paymaster General has said so far has clarified matters for us. If we use a health analogy, perhaps a barium meal would filter through the proposals and let us know the part that taxation would reach, but which as yet we have not worked out, and the possible relevant phrases in the clauses. I regret that we will have to press the amendment to a vote in frustration because of the inability or refusal of the Paymaster General to give the Committee proper guidance and information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Lady tell us whether a "novelty" or "fun" machine is anywhere defined in a way that the Committee could understand? Our imaginations could otherwise run riot about something that might be dreamt up by Mr. David Sullivan or Mr. Paul Raymond.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could not possibly comment on some of the more unusual games that might fall within the category of novelty or fun machines for some members of the Committee—and for Conservative Members in particular. I do not think that it would be helpful if I pursued that point, if only because I should probably get it wrong, having had such a sheltered upbringing and being very reserved as to the games that I consent to take part in—[<i>Laughter.</i>] Even the most innocent comments, including what I have just said, can be misunderstood. Perhaps I should rephrase it and say that I do not frequent arcades or use the machines, so I am unable to speculate on their possible development.</span></p>
