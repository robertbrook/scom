	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hilary Armstrong 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Durham, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This afternoon we are considering the changes for facilitating self-assessment. The clauses change the laws—mainly under the Taxes Act 1988—to make it easier to apply the changes to self-assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister about some issues which arise from the clause. They relate to what he was saying this morning about computers and information technology, when he failed to satisfy me on some of my concerns. Is the software currently being piloted? Will the Government report to us on the success of those pilots?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the break I had time to reflect on these issues and it is clear that, given the concerns that were raised this morning by several hon. Members, the Financial Secretary should find a way of reporting to the Committee on how existing pilots have worked. What problems have arisen so far? What possible changes to legislation have been identified? The right hon. Gentleman has already said that there will be further amendments to legislation next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, the right hon. Gentleman kept saying that everything was fine, but all outside bodies are telling us that everything is not fine. The clause is technical, but it relates to anti-avoidance measures. It is very important that such measures should be covered in pilots. I should like an assurance that the software is being piloted and that after the pilot studies have been undertaken, the House will be told what the Government have learnt from them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As before, I remind the Committee of my interest as a parliamentary advisor to the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Because, as I understand it, we are debating schedule 22 as much as clause 110, I should like to mention one or two of the points that the institute has raised about that schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It may be for the hon. Gentleman's convenience, and perhaps for that of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>532</span>
Committee, if he speaks about that matter when we debate the schedule. Another hon. Member also wants to speak to the schedule, so there will be a schedule stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reserve my remarks until the schedule, Mr. Hogg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sir George Young)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a small and perfectly formed clause about the transitional provisions which do not deal directly with the points raised by the hon. Member for Durham, Northwest (Ms Armstrong). When we reach clause 136, which is specifically about the electronic lodgment of tax returns, that might provide the best opportunity to deal with her points about where we are with electronic lodgment and pilots and using a computer disk for taxes instead of a brown form. That would be a tidier approach. If we are to have a debate on schedule 22, I shall make the bulk of my remarks then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>PREVENTION OF EXPLOITATION OF SCHEDULE 20 TO FINANCE ACT 1994</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a request to group all amendments to the schedule together. I agree to that. I shall call the Government amendment No. 234 and with that we will debate the remaining Government amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 234, in page 297, line 3, leave out from "is," to end of line 4 and insert
	<br><q><p>"365 divided by the number of days in the transitional overlap period;".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 235 to 241.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 110 and schedule 22 implement measures to prevent the exploitation of the rules for the transition from the preceding year to the current year basis of assessment of income taxed under schedule D. Those transitional rules work in a way which means that the profits or income arising in particular periods will be taxed at a reduced rate or, in some cases, will drop out of account altogether. They would therefore offer significant tax planning and avoidance opportunities in the absence of the measures I now propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of the measures is to deter and, where necessary, to counter attempts to manoeuvre business profits or other income artificially into those periods to obtain a tax advantage. The need for the provisions was made clear by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for National Heritage—previously the Financial Secretary—in a parliamentary answer on 31 March 1994. Since then, the Revenue has consulted on the detail and the draft legislation was published on Budget day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation was accompanied by an Inland Revenue commentary on the need for the provisions and guidance on the Revenue's interpretation of the proposed rules in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0806">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>533</span>
particular circumstances. That legislation, which is in clause 110 and schedule 22, contains a number of improvements, which have been widely welcomed, to the original proposals, taking into account the helpful comments received from representative bodies and other commentators. I have some further changes to propose today in response to the comments made on that draft legislation and I will come to those later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measures in the schedule identify the changes or transactions to be countered, cancel the tax advantage and, in some circumstances, impose an additional uplift based on the amount that would have escaped tax had the manoeuvre succeeded. The rules will not apply where the main benefit that could reasonably be expected was not a tax advantage or where the sole purpose of the transaction or change was a bona fide commercial one. There will be certain de minimis limits, to be set by regulations, below which the rules will not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measures also deal with a particular form of exploitation open to partnerships. During the transitional period, partnerships can obtain a tax advantage by replacing partnership borrowing with borrowing by individual partners. Where that is done for tax reasons the proposed measures provide for counteraction. There will, again, be de minimis limits below which the counteraction will not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 234 and 235 correct technical defects in the original drafting. They ensure that the level of turnover against which the de minimis exclusion test is measured is always proportionate to the length of the relevant underlying period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 238 concerns changes of accounting date of a business. It is already explicit in paragraph 13(2)(a) that a change that takes the end of the basis period for 1996–97 closer to 5 April 1997 is excluded from those rules. The intention is that other changes might trigger the provisions but concern has been expressed that that is not clear in the legislation as originally drafted. Therefore, I am happy to take the opportunity to clarify that through the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 236 responds to representations that the imposition of a penalty for the sort of tax avoidance covered in the clause and schedule is unfair. It responds by cancelling any penalty where the taxpayer discloses on the relevant tax return that the provisions of schedule 22 apply to relevant changes or transactions that he has carried out. Those people will find that the tax benefit that they would otherwise have gained will be lost, but broadly they will be no worse off than if the attempted avoidance had not taken place. That will meet the concern expressed by some who may act or may have acted without knowing the detail of anti-avoidance provisions, but who would not have wished to attempt to obtain a tax advantage if it carried the risk of additional cost. It will also help those who seek a ruling from the Revenue on whether the transaction that they have carried out is within the provisions and are told that it is. If they abide by the ruling there will be no additional profits or income brought into charge to tax over and above restoring the position to what it would have been without the offending transaction or change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's aim in introducing the penalty proposal in the schedule is to deter people from entering
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>534</span>
into the sort of avoidance transactions that are specified in the schedule. The amendment enables people who have none the less done so to declare them and thereby merely restores the position to what it would have been without the attempt at avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 237 and 239 to 241, which all have an identical effect, apply to the rule that disregards relevant transactions or relevant changes that are carried out solely for commercial purposes. Effectively that is a subjective test, looking at what was in the mind of the person who carried out the transaction or change. Some commentators have nevertheless suggested that the test is too widely drawn and that the counteraction should not apply where a commercial reason was a main driver for the transaction. I recognise the need for balance in the provisions, but that seems to go too far. The well-advised, would-be avoider would find that a particularly easy test to pass.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Case law has shown that where a transaction is in essence commercially driven, the sole purpose test is unlikely to be failed because of the mere demonstration that non-commercial thoughts were also in the minds of the parties. I do however consider that it will help people to understand more clearly the test's meaning if it uses language which is more generally familiar in tax legislation and which has had the benefit of elucidation through a long line of case law. I refer to the test applied to the deduction for tax purposes of business expenses. To qualify for a tax deduction, expenses must be laid out wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade. By replacing "solely" with "exclusively", the amendments will point to the link with the test in section 74(1)(a) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 to which I have referred. They will also reinforce the message in the Inland Revenue guidance of 29 November 1994 that, in interpreting the provisions, the Revenue would have regard to those considerations underlying the wholly and exclusively test. The change was suggested by the self-assessment consultative committee and I commend it to the Committee along with the other amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Twenty Second schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Milburn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Darlington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a couple of brief and crisp points to make, the Financial Secretary will be relieved to hear. Opposition members of the Committee welcome the anti-avoidance measures that have been introduced in the clause and the schedule. They are designed to prevent any exploitation during the transition from the prior year basis to the current year basis, as was determined by the Finance Act 1994. I hope that the Financial Secretary will answer the questions that I shall raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During last year's Committee session on the Finance Bill, anxiety was expressed about the conflation of two issues—the introduction of self-assessment and the shift from prior year basis to current year basis. As was discussed in Committee this morning, there are real anxieties about the additional administrative burden that will be imposed on smaller businesses and self-employed people as a result of the introduction of self-assessment. Alongside that will run the introduction of a new accounting period for taxation purposes. Some would say that that represents something of a double whammy on small businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The questions that I have for the Minister relate to points that were made during our debate this morning on self-assessment. What thought has the Revenue given to ensuring a thoroughgoing public education programme about the introduction of the measures? Will the programme that the Financial Secretary has in mind run alongside the programme that he outlined this morning for self-assessment, or will it be clearly differentiated from that programme? Given the complexity of the transitional year, there is a real danger that those on the receiving end will become more confused. Instructions and information should be made available to smaller businesses to avoid further confusion. I hope that the Financial Secretary will answer that question when he replies to this debate, which I am sure will be fairly short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>536</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Hogg, for your guidance earlier. I shall not repeat the caveat that I made earlier. I assume that other members of the Committee will have heard it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The accountancy profession and all honourable taxpayers welcome the amendments to which my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has just spoken. They will improve what would otherwise have been a rather impenetrable and difficult schedule, even for the professionals working in the relevant area. I am sure that both sides of the Committee welcome the fact that the penal element that was in the schedule as it was originally drafted seems to have has been reduced as a result of consultation. That underlines the importance of adequate consultation, which has been emphasised previously by both sides of the Committee. That is especially important when one is dealing with self-assessment and a current year basis for taxation, which are significant changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many members of the Committee are worried about the automatic aspect in the schedule. It seems that there is not enough scope for mitigation in cases where taxpayers and their advisers genuinely do not intend to deprive the Revenue of the tax that it legitimately expects to receive. One could argue that there should be no penalty in the absence of very strong suspicion of fraud or negligence. The problem is that many of the aspects of the schedule, which is very long, appear to many tax practitioners to be somewhat subjective and judgmental. It seems possible that taxpayers could be vulnerable to significant penalties even if they did not intend to avoid tax—or perhaps I should say more precisely, as I am always criticising others for looseness of language—to evade tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will be aware, Mr. Hogg, of the old principle in English law of mens rea, which is the principle of intent. There is a good case for saying that that could apply equally to tax law as to other aspects of English law. It is not sufficiently allowed for in the schedule. Perhaps my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will say a few words on that important, slightly philosophical point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality of such legislation is that taxpayers may be caught simply because they cannot convince the Revenue and cannot afford the legal costs of taking an important case to appeal. Many taxpayers shelter behind better-off brethren in the hope that the latter will take cases all the way to appeal to obtain the clarification that can only come from a well-argued case in the High Court. That constitutes an uneven playing field between the taxpayer and the Revenue and I hope that my right hon. Friend can point to some elements in the schedule—I confess that I have not read every word of it—which cover that concern of legitimate taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also concern about the complexity and length of the schedule. That is a repeated complaint not only by members of the Committee, but by those who are acquainted with the views of tax practitioners and tax professionals. It unites both laymen and experts and I wish my right hon. Friend could do something effective about that. He made radical statements earlier in our proceedings, to which attention was drawn in the press, that he seriously intended to consider the problem during the long year that I trust he will hold his distinguished post. I hope that he will do that swiftly because he and I are mindful of the fact that electoral timetables are always
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0808">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>537</span>
precarious and the sooner we are able to make progress in tackling complexity in this area the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example of the gratuitous complexity in the schedule. You will have noticed, Mr. Hogg, during your close reading of the schedule—I know how concerned you are with such detailed questions—that paragraph 1 sets out the effect of the relevant changes and transactions, yet the terms of those relevant changes and transactions are not defined until paragraph 13, some seven pages further on in the schedule. Tax practitioners may be used to those quaint ways of the Revenue and may have no problem with them, but we should try to write tax legislation in such a way that the layman has a sporting chance of understanding it and being able to read it logically from beginning through middle to end. That is more important than it used to be because we are now moving firmly towards self-assessment, which is implicit in all these large changes. In self-assessment, one cannot assume that it will be possible or desirable for all taxpayers, especially those with more complicated tax affairs, to invest in a tax professional's advice, which may be expensive if the case is complicated.

It is incumbent on the Revenue to pursue the goals of the taxpayers charter and other goals that have been put upon it in the cause of plain English to try to find a way of presenting this dense and complex legislation in a way that is more user friendly and helpful to ordinary taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my right hon. Friend insists on a penal element in the schedule, it might be better achieved by means of a specific penalty which is known and clearly stated in advance—for example, 10 or 15 per cent. of the tax shifted—but which is capable of mitigation in appropriate and justified instances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter deserves careful consideration and I hope that my right hon. Friend will make some helpful comments to the Committee, hopefully now rather than later, on these important points which concern not just the profession, but all of us as honest taxpayers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister one question. One of the amendments to which we agreed raised the principle that penalties will not apply when arrangements are fully disclosed on a tax return. That is an interesting departure from the usual procedure. However, it refers only to the transitional year. Will the Government monitor the effectiveness of that arrangement? Will they examine the operation of the provision over the transitional year and assess whether it should be applied on other areas of tax law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting and helpful debate on the schedule, which may rival clause 75 as the least understandable clause in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with the point raised by the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn). I am sure that everyone agrees that it is more sensible to tax on a current year, rather than a preceding year, basis because the tax paid more closely relates to the actual position. People affected by the schedule are currently assessed on the previous year basis. Therefore, the intellectual task facing reformers was how to get from the previous to the current year. There are three ways of doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>538</span>
The first, which would be popular with the Treasury, but would be most unpopular with everyone else, would be to collect in one year tax for the previous and for the current year. That can quickly be dismissed. Another option would be simply to move from the previous to the current year by allowing one year to drop out of the equation entirely. That would afford opportunities for tax planning because one could cram profits into the year that would be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the solution that we propose is to have a transitional year, which is, in effect, an average of two years. We believe that that is the fairest solution. There is an advantage to that system because one may try to include as much income as possible and exclude as much expenditure as possible from the years that are averaged. If expenditure is excluded, it can then be set off in full. That is why we need a provision such as this. I am sorry that it is complicated, but the amount of money at stake is high—about £8 billion a year is coming in and schemes are already being canvassed that would make creative use of the transitional year. The provision may be long, but that is necessary to block off the creative opportunities that people might find.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of guidance raised by the hon. Member for Darlington—we have already provided preliminary guidance on the draft legislation and the Revenue will provide further guidance as necessary. It is valid to say that averaging raises slightly more difficult issues than simply carrying on as before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman), with his shrewd common sense, asked why 10 pages of legislation were necessary to deal with something relatively minor and short term. The one-off nature and extent of the tax-planning opportunities that the rules to achieve transition to a current year basis of assessment offer have been widely publicised. Without those measures, we estimate that hundreds of millions of pounds of tax could be at stake. Many details are included because, in consultation, representative bodies argued for certainty rather than a general catch-all provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested that any penalty was wrong because it was illegal to avoid tax, but a penalty is necessary because the proposals are designed to deter as well as to counter attempts at exploitation. To deal with my hon. Friend's specific point, amendment No. 236 addresses the particular issue that worried him—when a small business man, who has somehow changed his accounting procedure or invoicing arrangements, finds that he may have been caught by the anti-avoidance provisions. Amendment No. 236 enables him to go to the Revenue and say, "Yes, I have done this". If he shows his hand to the Revenue—if he declares it—there is no penalty; he simply pays the tax that he would have paid if the trigger event had not been activated by the taxpayer. That amendment was a result of consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the imaginary small business man have to go to the Revenue within a set time period? How soon would he be required to spot his own error?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He would have to disclose it in his return. If he did so, the Revenue would not then apply any penal provisions, such as those that are set out. Where a person is inadvertently brought within the provisions, no penalty will be due if he voluntarily discloses that. In

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>539</span>
addition, the provisions would not apply if the transaction was undertaken for bona fide commercial purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked why there was no power to mitigate the penalty. We need a relatively simple method of deterring and countering exploitation of transitional rules. The possibility of mitigation would complicate significantly the operation of the rules and make the schedule, which has already taxed my hon. Friend's patience, even longer than it is now. In particular, no yardstick exists for measuring culpability in this sort of avoidance. However, as I said, where there is voluntary disclosure the penalty provisions will not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Ms Armstrong) raised an interesting point about voluntary disclosure on which I should like to reflect. I suspect that at present if someone submits a return, discovers that he made a mistake and then voluntarily discloses that to the Inland Revenue, the Revenue takes a commonsense approach and does not trigger any penalties of the sort that we are considering. The Revenue would want to examine the circumstances before making a decision. However, I take the hon. Lady's point that we have introduced the principle of voluntary disclosure and I shall see whether there is any opportunity to build on it and use it elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a helpful debate. I have tried to deal with all the points, but I see my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington poised to get to his feet—his body language indicates that I may have omitted a point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>540</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my right hon. Friend could address the point that I made as a small coda to my remarks. I pointed out that there might be another way of achieving the deterrent effect of which he spoke, by means of a specific quantified penalty of, say, 10 or 15 per cent. of the tax shifted. My right hon. Friend did not deal with that point. If I keep talking for a few moments, perhaps it will be possible for him to tell us some of the reasons why he and the Chancellor set their faces against that method.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In effect, we have done what my hon. Friend has suggested. The penalty is 25 per cent. My hon. Friend said that we had originally envisaged something more penal—100 per cent.—but having consulted we reduced that to 25 per cent. In due course we shall outline the de minimis rules, which may exclude many small businesses. I think that the figure of 25 per cent. is buried somewhere in the intestines of the schedule. It is our intention to have a fixed percentage of 25 per cent., rather than the original 100 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
