<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Anthony Nelson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned for lunch, I was in the process of concluding our short debate on clause 46. One outstanding point remained. The hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon) asked about the addition of Iceland and Norway. The new regulatory regime—the single passport in Europe—applies to all countries that have adopted the third life insurance directive. Under the European Economic Area agreement, EEA countries have signed up to and have been required to adopt the third life insurance directive. Of the original signatories, only two countries, Iceland and Norway, remain members of the EEA without joining the European Union. But since they have adopted the third life directive, Icelandic and Norwegian life insurance companies, which are not regulated by the DTI, come within the new extension to the definition of insurance company.</span></p>

TRANSFER OF LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a brief point. Can the Minister explain exactly what schedule 9 does and under what circumstances it is meant to come into play?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause and its measures adapt the current provisions that deal with transfers of life and other long-term insurance business. Under current legislation, a number of special provisions apply that aim to provide continuity of tax treatment of the business, notwithstanding change of ownership. Those provisions apply where a scheme of transfer has been sanctioned by a United Kingdom court. The aim is twofold.<br><br>
First, it ensures that the provisions will apply when the transfer of UK business has been sanctioned by the regulatory authority in another member state of the EU or the EEA. Each member state is now almost exclusively
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 256</span>
responsible for the regulation of its own insurance companies. That includes regulating transfers of business by a branch in another state such as the UK. Secondly, it prevents one of the provisions relating to capital allowances from being used where the transferee does not continue to carry on the business in the UK. That will ensure that appropriate balancing adjustments are made when an asset leaves the UK tax net so that tax relief is given on the whole of the net expenditure by a UK taxpayer, but on no more than the whole.<br><br>
Those measures apply to transfers sanctioned or authorised after 30 June 1994 and will coincide with the EC third life and third non-life insurance directives which came into force on 1 July 1994. My right hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough (Mr. Dorrell) announced that we would introduce those measures in the Finance Bill in June last year.</span></p>

FRIENDLY SOCIETIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a short clause on friendly societies which, as all members of the Committee who serve on the Finance Bill every year will know, comes up as an annual event. Each year the Government increase the permitted contribution to friendly societies by a small amount. The Bill proposes to increase the contribution from £200 to £270. We have not tabled an amendment this year, as I think that we can discuss the matter in the clause stand part debate. However, it would be interesting to know whether the Government's thinking is likely to change towards friendly societies. The sum of £270 is not much in the scheme of things. Every year, all members of the Committee on the Finance Bill are lobbied by friendly societies about the maximum contribution. I have never understood why it is kept so low. Most hon. Members believe that friendly societies are a good thing and that they should be encouraged. People save with them, particularly those who do not save large amounts, and if there is an opportunity to make an annual premium of more than £270, I do not know why that should not be allowed.<br><br>
Since the appropriate Minister is present, I should like to raise a further and directly relevant point. Members of the Committee and other hon. Members will be aware that several friendly societies are concerned about the compliance costs they must meet because they conduct investment business, which under the terms of the Financial Services Act 1986 means that they must register with the Personal Investment Authority. Friendly societies are fairly small bodies, with low levels of administration, so additional compliance costs are likely to impose a disproportionate burden.<br><br>
We cannot exempt friendly societies from the Financial Services Act because they conduct investment business, no matter how small that business may be. I understand that the Personal Investment Authority has now set up a small working party to examine those problems that aims
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0652">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 257</span>
to try to alleviate the burden. Is the Minister aware of that? If he is, is he able to say anything that might encourage friendly societies to believe that that particular burden may be eased? We do not ask that they be exempted from the provisions of Financial Services Act, but the societies' administrative costs are disproportionately increased by compliance. We debate the matter in the House on an annual basis, and it is appropriate to flag that as a problem that the Government may care to examine.<br><br>
The primary question I want to ask is why the tax relief amount has increased so slowly over such a long period. It was £100 in 1990; it is only £270 now. It appears that the Government accept that there should be an increase, so why did they not raise it to £500?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I did last year, I want to say a few words in support of friendly societies. Members of the Committee—especially those who served on this Committee last year—will know that I then declared a small interest, and I shall do so again today. I have a modest policy with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Friendly Society, to which I pay small monthly premiums. I remember that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) had cause to make a similar confession last year. I therefore have some knowledge of the subject, partly provided by Mr. Peter Gray and other members of the Friendly Societies Parliamentary Committee, to whom I pay tribute, and also from my own experience. From personal experience I have come to the conclusion that friendly societies are a good thing—there are arguments which should commend them to hon. Members. Against that background, I should like to say a few words on the subject.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central suggested, it was made clear to the members of last year's Committee on the Finance Bill that the Government felt unable to act radically to support friendly societies on the issue of the tax relief amount. If I remember rightly, my right hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough hid behind the prospect of the overall savings review, for which he was then responsible as Financial Secretary. That review is now behind us, and it would be interesting to hear from my hon. Friend the Minister whether the fruits of that review have thrown any light on the future of friendly societies as small, but none the less significant, savings instruments in the range available to those who save small amounts.<br><br>
I strongly agree with the point made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central about the compliance costs and regulatory burden laid on friendly societies. They are unable to spread those costs over a large base of business, and the burden weighs disproportionately on them in comparison to some insurance companies and larger competitors.<br><br>
In case my hon. Friend the Minister receives the impression that we are being churlish, let me hasten to assure him that we are grateful for small mercies. Those of us who support friendly societies are grateful that the relief amount was increased from £200 to £270, but my hon. Friend will know, as I do, that the friendly societies asked for a modest £360 a year. Indeed, as the hon. Gentleman said they were hoping for the relief to be extended to £500 over a two-year period. We are only
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 258</span>
halfway to that £500 objective. I hope that that will be achieved more swiftly than is the Revenue and the Treasury's current intention.<br><br>
I give the Minister early notice of the fact that, as one achieves nothing in the Committee without perseverance, if I have the good fortune to be selected to sit on this Committee in future years, I shall probably press again for more generous relief for friendly societies which will enable them to make a more substantial contribution to the overall private sector savings arena. They have an important part to play at the modest end of the savings market, as I am sure my hon. Friend will realise from his research into and knowledge of the matter. They embrace values and principles such as self-help, thrift and benevolence, which should be encouraged by any Conservative Government and, indeed, usually are. My hon. Friend will know that the cash collection insurance companies are withdrawing gradually from the low-premium market, the market in which friendly societies have traditionally specialised. Therefore, it is a natural niche for them. My hon. Friend will be aware of the startling fact that the minimum premiums accepted by the cash collection insurance companies are frequently above the maximum tax-exempt premiums permitted for saving with friendly societies, and there is a powerful case for them.<br><br>
We all pay lipservice to the principle of the level playing field for savings instruments. Indeed, that should have emerged from the so-called Dorrell review, which is why I mentioned it earlier. It is worth bearing in mind that services offered by friendly societies are not on a level playing field when compared to personal equity plans and tax-exempt special savings accounts. If not this year but next year, when TESSAs come to the end of their five-year period, there will be a powerful case for doing more for friendly societies.<br><br>
I could say more about the broad arguments in favour of friendly societies, but I shall focus briefly on a couple of detailed points which I should like my hon. Friend to answer either now or in correspondence. I appreciate that he might want to consider them with his advisers. The powers granted to the Inland Revenue under section 465 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 appear to deter innovation and growth of friendly society business. Friendly societies have made that clear to members of the Committee on various occasions. It also appears, as my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary acknowledged in a recent letter to me dated 10 February, that section 465 could sensibly be repealed because its purpose is effectively spent—what my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary would refer to as otiose, one of his favourite words.<br><br>
Only two small differences remain in tax law between the tax treatment of pre-May 1966 friendly societies and post-May 1966 friendly societies, which are both defined in law. In the interests of taking a small step towards simplification of tax legislation, which is always a good cause and one which I am sure my hon. Friend would sign up to, I urge him to consider tidying the matter, perhaps on Report, to go some way towards meeting the needs of friendly societies.<br><br>
The second technical point is that friendly societies are concerned about the apparently unlimited discretionary power for the Inland Revenue under section 461 of the same Act. My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0653">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 259</span>
said in his letter to me that that was being reviewed. I hope that during that review, my hon. Friend will be able to tell the Committee that he will consider carefully whether the scope of the discretion available to the Revenue is still commensurate with the original objectives of that section.<br><br>
If it is not commensurate and if it, too, has become rather excessive in proportion to need, I hope that the Minister will look pragmatically at the position and see whether he can amend the law now or subsequently to produce a more friendly framework for friendly societies.<br><br>
I am grateful for the brief chance to make those points on behalf of what is, by any standards, a very worthy savings movement.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to respond to this brief debate on an important subject which, as members of the Committee have said, has been raised in successive Finance Bills. The Government sensibly try to listen to such representations and respond when resources permit. Such an occasion has arisen this year and I am grateful for the warm reception that has been given to the proposed change by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central and by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman).<br><br>
Both the hon. Gentleman and hon. Friend questioned the limit and I should like to explain why we have set it at that level. The clause and the schedule increase the ceiling for tax privileged friendly society policies from £18.50 to £25 a month. The current ceiling was set in 1991. We hope that the increase will help friendly societies to retain their competitive position in the savings market and will be of particular benefit to smaller savers.<br><br>
The object of the tax exemption is to enable societies to offer worthwhile life insurance policies to that sector of the population that traditionally the friendly society movement alone has served—smaller savers who need small policies which inevitably carry disproportionately high administrative costs in relation to the premium or benefit insured. The tax exemption helps to offset those administrative costs, allowing societies to offer terms which represent value-for-money at levels of premium considered uncommercial by the majority of life insurance companies.<br><br>
Above a certain level of premium, the ratio of administrative expenses to the premiums will come within the normal range for life insurance policies and the justification for the exemption is lost. In the present life assurance market, a tax exempt limit set any higher than a premium of £25 a month would miss the point of the exemption. A higher ceiling would give friendly societies an unjustified tax advantage over life assurance companies.<br><br>
Our support for the friendly society movement has been clearly expressed not just by the raising of the limit, but by the Friendly Societies Act 1992, which gave societies the freedom to expand the range of services which they could offer to their members. We have recently been under pressure to raise the limit further than is proposed today. We do not feel that that would be right because,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 260</span>
although the proposed limit will approximate to 60 or 61 per cent. of the average new life assurance premium—there is therefore, admittedly, a gap between this level and the average level of the new life assurance premium—it is a significant revalorisation of the existing limit. The 1991 limit of £200 is equivalent to £221 in present value terms, but it is being raised to £270. In 1990 the limit was £150, which in present value terms is equivalent to £180.<br><br>
There has been pressure today to increase the limit further, as there was during the passage of last year's Finance Bill. We look at the limit from time to time, but we do not believe that it is right for those businesses to extend their sales—trespass would perhaps be too pejorative a word—into the area covered by the life assurance industry. There is plenty of scope for offering both diversity of products and existing products within those limits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us a little more about the formula applied by the Government? From what the Minister said, it seems to be somewhat hit and miss. I cannot understand the justification for £270. It might as well be anything in the range from £200 to £350 because the Government seem to be taking a broad brush approach in trying to ensure that friendly societies do not compete. I doubt whether there is much competition between friendly societies and life assurance companies. Will the Minister tell us a little more about how the formula works? I assume that there is no great cost to the Government but will the Minister tell the Committee how he fixed the sum of £270?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the question of cost, we estimate the long-term cost of the measure to the Exchequer to be about £10 million a year. That figure is necessarily uncertain but the cost depends on the extent to which the public turn from insurance companies to friendly societies for smaller life insurance policies. Given those uncertainties, we shall keep a close watch on the new business to see how the increase in the limit for tax exempt policies affects the market for life insurance.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is right; there is no formulaic approach to setting the limit. However, research is carried out into the lower levels of life assurance premiums on offer. By examining the marketing information available, it is possible to see the lower levels of premium that life assurance companies are interested in writing policies for. That tells us something. It seems to indicate that life assurance companies are not interested in business below that level of premium. That should be some pointer towards what the upper limit of contribution from friendly societies should be.<br><br>
We do not take only that figure because, as I have said, it can change over a period of time. To prevent destabilising movements from the tax preferentially-treated sector of friendly societies into the life assurance sector, we would take only a proportion of that.<br><br>
The 1991 increase in the tax exempt limit to £200 took it to 52 per cent. of the average new premium on an ordinary branch policy sold by the life insurance industry at large. The limit now proposed represents 61 per cent. of the current average new premium. Tax exempt business is being taken closer to the mainstream of life insurance business and we cannot be that far from the point where a large amount of new business will be redirected to the societies, with substantial cost to the Exchequer.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0654">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 261</span>
We do not have the data with which to model, beyond a limited range, the effect of increases in the friendly society tax-exempt limit on the market for life insurance. When a change in the marketing focus of the life insurance companies justifies an increase in the limit for tax-exempt friendly society policies, we shall have to test the waters carefully to ensure that we do not overshoot our objective of providing affordable life assurance policies for a membership of modest means.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, throughout his speech, has been remarkably protective of life assurance companies. To find out why that is, will he confirm that what lies behind his remarks is that, since the tax changes made by Lord Lawson some years ago which removed life assurance from the zone of tax relief and was said to be the beginning of a wider policy of cutting back on tax relief, the Treasury and the Inland Revenue do not want to see too much of a shift of business from an area that does not qualify for tax relief to one that does?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend refers to the change that occurred with the introduction of personal tax allowance on contributions to life assurance policies. That is not the point. The point is that life assurance companies and policyholders' funds within life assurance companies are taxed in the way that we discussed earlier. They are liable on the I—E basis to taxation on their income less their expenses at a broad rate of 25 per cent. When the policyholders' savings go in they bear taxation, and when they come out they do so tax free to the policyholder.<br><br>
Friendly societies are different. They are not taxed in the same way, and funds are treated as gross funds. Friendly societies are treated differently and, alongside life assurance companies, they are treated preferentially. Friendly societies have that tax benefit. They do not suffer the same tax regime as life assurance companies because it has always been acknowledged that to be able to offer small savings schemes to people involves proportionately high management expenses.<br><br>
The only way that such schemes can be offered effectively by friendly societies is to offset the costs with a preferential tax regime. Clearly, the more that the limit is raised, and once that begins to bite into the normal life assurance market, a product would be on offer that was not designed for that area. The economies of scale relating to the contributions to life assurance societies mean that they are more able to meet their management charges and the tax regime that is imposed on them.<br><br>
The answer to the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington is that because different tax regimes apply to the two sectors, a demarcation should remain in the limit that can be allowed by way of contribution to friendly societies. The level of the limit for friendly society tax-exempt life insurance business must be considered in the context of the premiums that people pay. More than three quarters of the households whose expenditure includes life assurance premiums pay no more than £300 a year. The proposed increase of the limit to £25 per month would enable the friendly society movement to provide on a tax-exempt basis for the life insurance requirements of the greater part of the population.<br><br>
The wider context of savings, and the work initiated by the former Financial Secretary in that area, have been
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 262</span>
discussed. The conclusions of his welcome study will continue to inform the decisions and policies about savings products and tax policy within the Treasury. Some of the changes that were announced for TESSAs and PEPs reflect the conclusion of that study, as does the increase that we have discussed today. The changes have also come about in response to worries that have been expressed on both sides of the Committee, and as a result of the excellent work of Peter Gray. My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington rightly paid tribute to Mr. Gray for the excellent work that he has done for the Friendly Societies Parliamentary Committee, through which he has kept Ministers informed of the views, concerns and proposals of that industry.<br><br>
I am not sure that this is the appropriate occasion to debate the whole of savings policy. However, I should say that, at least for the present, the reform is one small dividend from that savings review.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington asked about section 465. In recent decades, several waves of new societies have been set up to exploit the friendly society exemptions in ways that were never intended. The traditional societies would not lend themselves to such practices. The countermeasure adopted each time was the introduction of a more restrictive tax regime which, in recognition of the self-restraint of the established societies, was applied only to recently registered societies or to those that would be registered in future. The old society was left with a greater range of opportunity than a new society on a basis of trust. However, not all old societies resisted the opportunities that the new societies were set up to exploit. Accordingly, each time that the regime was made more restrictive, a power was given—to the registrar of the Friendly Societies Commission, or the Inland Revenue—to bring an old society into the new regime if it abused its privileged position.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
We still need our defences against the tax avoidance possibilities implicit in the friendly societies' unlimited exemption for non-life business, but perhaps the concept of a distinction between old and new societies, accompanied by discretionary reclassification, has had its day. Therefore, we have asked the Inland Revenue to consider alternative approaches to the avoidance problem to give societies a more certain foundation from which to plan their future development.<br><br>
I agree with the thrust of my hon. Friend's argument that the measure is increasingly unnecessary and redundant, and after consultation we may be minded to come forward with a proposal to amend or discontinue it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That assurance will be most welcome to the friendly societies.<br><br>
My hon. Friend referred to the danger of abuse and obviously he, as a Treasury Minister, must be mindful of that. Will he tell the Committee how many documented cases of abuse there have been under the existing law? If there have been very few or none, he may be worrying unnecessarily.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot give my hon. Friend a precise figure, but I shall be happy to write to

him with the information. There have been such cases but we believe that following changes in the law they are now less of a problem.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central raised the important matter of costs. We think it right that the costs of maintaining the Friendly Societies Commission should be borne by the societies for which it was set up, but we are aware of the effect that immediate full cost recovery could have on the movement. Accordingly, full cost recovery is being introduced over a transitional period. In 1994–95 the largest society will have paid no more than £16,000, while two thirds of societies will have paid the minimum charge of £150.<br><br>
I have received representations, as have other hon. Members, on the cost of regulation on the friendly societies sector and I acknowledge that the issue must be brought into the equation of limits, tax relief and powers. They all go together and that is why the PIA and others have examined the matter carefully. Mr. Gray is playing a distinguished and important role in chairing the committee that is examining the matter. I have no outcome of that review to share with the Committee today, but I am watchful and will heed carefully any concerns and proposals that are put forward on the cost of regulation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask a question on a matter that I have not understood, perhaps because I have missed something. There is a difference between £25 a month and £250 a year. Will the Minister comment on that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can, off hand—[<i>Interruption.</i>] Inspiration has come to me. The answer is that a 10 per cent. discount is given for monthly premiums which accounts for the difference between the overall figure and the monthly figure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington raised a number of interesting points, as he does every year. When he referred to his future years of service he sounded like a man who knew that he had many years to serve before release—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Hoon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ashfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rather more than that. Hon. Members have the chance to be a member of the Finance Bill Standing Committee even when in opposition. The hon. Gentleman was right to remind me that my children have two friendly society accounts, but I do not believe that that is a declarable interest and it has certainly not influenced me today.<br><br>
I should like to take the Minister up on the savings review. I hope that, unlike the other review being conducted by the former Financial Secretary, the Government might see fit to publishing their considerations on savings. This is not the place for a general debate on savings policy, but I am sure that all members of the Committee accept that it is important to encourage saving.<br><br>
Under Lord Lawson, the clearly discernible pattern to Government policy was to remove tax incentives. When the present Prime Minister became Chancellor he changed that policy and the tax system was skewed to encourage certain forms of saving. The whole House should consider
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 264</span>
the general principle of saving and how we ought to encourage it. The Minister's comments on the impact of the measure on friendly societies reinforces the point that the Government ought to consider it. It should be a matter of open debate rather than being kept top secret.<br><br>
That said, we have had a useful annual debate on the friendly societies and I look forward to resuming it this time next year.</span></p>

QUALIFYING LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In some ways, we return to some of the points that we were discussing before lunch. In reply to those Conservative Members who keep asking me, no, I did not get any lunch—I missed it—but otherwise we had a fruitful discussion, though I am sorry that I did not hear the rest of the debate.<br><br>
The clause raises an important point because it abolishes the Inland Revenue's role in certifying qualifying life insurance policies from 5 May next year. We should not simply nod through such an important step.<br><br>
The Budget press release issued last November says that the measure is introduced as part of the third directive on insurance in order to create a single market, but if we are moving from the Inland Revenue the responsibility for certifying whether a policy qualifies for self-certification, we are entitled to ask what safeguards the Government are putting in place to ensure that the work presently done by the Inland Revenue is done by somebody else. A company might sell a policy, believing that it qualified, but that information might subsequently turn out to be wrong, because nobody, it would appear, would have certified it one way or the other.<br><br>
In their press release, the Government said that they would publish draft clauses during 1995 with a view to a wider reform in 1996 because the rules for taxing gains are to be changed. It would be helpful if the Government could tell us in general terms what changes they anticipate. Will the changes be readily understandable to people holding live policies? Who will satisfy policy holders as to whether their policy qualifies and who will police that?<br><br>
The clause raises a number of fundamental issues. It is all very well for the Government to say that it is all right because it is a deregulatory measure, but we need to be satisfied that somebody is in a position to take over the functions previously exercised by the Inland Revenue. Presumably the Inland Revenue does not want to be concerned with such matters in the future because it might be thought to be a barrier to new entrants or new products coming on the market, but for as long as there is a need to certify whether a policy qualifies, somebody has to do it. I should be grateful if the Minister could tell us what the Government's position is and what the new rules are. No

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 265</span>
doubt we shall then press him further, depending on his response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point. The rules will be simpler because they will be easier to operate. The Revenue audit powers are strengthened in clause 51 and the Revenue will offer help to insurers after certification. Clause 49 removes the condition that a model form of policy must be certified by the Inland Revenue if it is to be what is known as a qualifying policy. Such a policy, in most circumstances, qualifies for privileged tax treatment as the proceeds from a qualifying policy are generally exempt from income tax.<br><br>
The measure will remove a regulatory burden in line with the introduction of a more liberal regulatory regime for insurance business in the single European market. There may be some doubt about whether prior certification by the Inland Revenue of model forms of life insurance policies is compatible with the requirements of the third life insurance directive, which came into force last year.<br><br>
Certification is due to come to an end from 5 May 1996 and that should allow life insurance offices enough time to adapt to the change. We recognise that abolishing prior certification, while retaining current rules by which qualifying status is determined, would be unsatisfactory.<br><br>
The industry generally agrees that current rules are far too complex, even if the Inland Revenue provides an advisory service.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central pointed out, we propose bringing forward later this year measures that will simplify tax rules determining which policies of life insurance should qualify for special treatment. I cannot say more than that today to indicate what those proposals for consultation might be, but the intention in terms of compliance with the directive and in terms of simplification is to replace certification with that advisory service.<br><br>
I agree with the general thrust of the point raised by the hon. Gentleman. The industry wants to know where it stands as soon as possible. The matter has already been subject to considerable discussion and we hope to proceed as far as possible on a basis of consensus.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that there will be an advisory service. If someone at the Revenue is to advise, as opposed to certify, will the Minister tell us exactly what saving will be made? It strikes me that people will be doing exactly the same job only they will issue advice instead of a certificate. If a Government agency issues advice, one should be entitled to rely on it as if it were a certificate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope and believe that considerable savings, streamlining and benefits will be derived from the proposed change. The objectives of the reform are to simplify and modernise the rules to reflect developments in policies designed since the current rules were framed; to eliminate anomalies in the charging provisions; and to recast the rules for calculating gains on partial surrenders; so that they operate more fairly as between policyholders and the Exchequer. The fact that we are publishing the draft clauses later this year to give insurers time to prepare for the changes should mean that transitional costs are minimised. It should be the case that where reliance
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 266</span>
primarily rests on the company not the Revenue for certification, there will be a switch of costs and responsibilities, which should alleviate the cost to the Inland Revenue and, therefore, to the Exchequer.<br><br>
There will be a lighter touch, therefore, but the Inland Revenue will endeavour as far as possible to provide guidance to ensure that products remain within the curtilage and remit of qualification and will be open for advice on such points. We shall endeavour to build in protections and to be of assistance to the industry. However, the move is necessary and is justified on directive and cost grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If advice is given by the Revenue, is a duty of care owed to anyone? If so, how is that duty of care to give appropriate advice to be enforced should that advice be incorrect, defective or incomplete?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware that the Revenue will have a duty of care. The new system will be different because the Revenue will lose its right to control a qualifying policy but will endeavour to be as helpful as possible. It might arise that whether something was a qualifying policy or not becomes a question for legal review. Obviously, the intention would be not to reach that stage, and the Inland Revenue would be as helpful as possible in providing some comfort and guidance, without accepting the full duty of care—as I understand it from the hon. Gentleman's question and intervention—and thereby taking on responsibility or almost a certification by another name for the product concerned.<br><br>
Advice does not amount to a guarantee of, or a duty of care or certification for, the product.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister further on the light touch and the advice to which he has referred? We may not agree with the Minister's proposition, but we can understand why the Government are putting it forward. The burden of certification is to be transferred from the Inland Revenue to self-certification—the clause is about a system of self-certification for insurance policies—and on several occasions today, the Minister has referred to the third life and non-life directives. Will the minister confirm that the self-certification process envisaged under clause 49 is a requirement of those directives? As I understand the directives, they were to open up the insurance business in the European Union and the European Economic Area on the basis of a qualifying organisation in a member state that satisfies the conditions of that member state being given the right to operate in another member state.<br><br>
How does the thrust toward self-certification fit in with that process? I cannot immediately see the connection, but I would welcome clarification from the Minister on that point. If we are to accept that the basis of the Government's proposals is compliance with European directives, we must press the Minister to tell us how the considerable extension of self-certification and deregulation fits in with the requirements of the directives.<br><br>
The Minister spoke about advice that would be put together by the Inland Revenue to complement the light-touch approach. Will he tell us whether the 10-year period for policies to be certified will have any effect on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0657">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 267</span>
growing insurance market for elderly people? Has that point been considered? I confess that I have done no homework on the subject, but it occurs to me that the requirement for provision of at least 10 years means one thing to a 30-year-old, but might mean something else to a 60-year-old. I would welcome clarification from the Minister on that issue.<br><br>
I am concerned about the burden of certification moving from the Inland Revenue to self-certification, not so much because of the self-certification process itself, because the Minister has assured us that advice will be put together in pursuit of the light-touch approach, but because of the question of who will monitor the process of self-certification. Which organisation will have the responsibility of monitoring that important process resulting from a radical change that is motivated either by Government policy or by a requirement under the third life and non-life European directives? It is very important. We are getting into unknown areas. It is a step in the dark because such an operation has not been used in the UK or in other member states.<br><br>
What strategic objective is being served by clause 49(4) which ends the obligation of insurers under paragraph 22 to provide a policyholder, on request, with a certificate confirming that a qualifying policy has been certified? The Revenue has a responsibility to hear appeals when a policy prior to May 1995 has not been certified. The insurers will be responsible for a self-certification, so they will know what is going on. The only people who will not know what is going on are the people who have purchased the certified insurance policies—the customers.<br><br>
What possible gain can be made by denying a policyholder the right to know whether a policy has been certified? Perhaps that is part of the third life and non-life directives and is to be introduced at the insistence of that horrible European Commission. However, I doubt it. The clause is fascinating and worrying. What is the Government's intention in ensuring that the Revenue and the insurers know what is going on, but that the customer does not?<br><br>
I hope that the Minister can clarify those points. Although not accepting the thrust of deregulation and self-certification per se, and unless it is a requirement of the directive—we shall have confirmation of that from the Minister—if the clause is not amended, important matters will be raised which will concern the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely convinced by what the Minister said, for several reasons. He has yet to spell out why the Government want to make the case for abandoning certification and moving to what he called advice. There might be a good case, but the hon. Gentleman has not made it. Let us consider the difference between certification and advice. The Inland Revenue issues a certificate that can be relied upon by an institution, a policyholder or anyone else. The Minister has now said that there will not be a certificate, but new rules and regulations on which the Revenue will give advice. The Revenue is different from most advisers in that it is reputable as a representative of Government. Therefore, the advice from the Government through the Revenue should be reliable. Were one to receive a letter from the Revenue, it might be thought to have almost the same effect as a certificate.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 268</span>
The Minister has not told us in what way advice will be different. Advice is either the best advice—the definitive answer—or it is no advice at all. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I am glad that the subject is of such interest that Members are flocking in to listen to what I have to say.<br><br>
The Revenue should give the best advice that it can; otherwise, it is worse than useless. Where is the saving? If we are to employ people to sit in the Revenue and give advice who would otherwise be granting certificates, in terms of personnel, that is curious indeed.<br><br>
It seems that some hon. Members think that a Division is taking place in the Committee considering the Finance Bill. Someone must be blessed with foresight that has eluded other members of the Committee.<br><br>
The Minister must explain the difference between advice and certification. He said that advice could not be relied upon; so why was it involved in the first place? The situation is far from being satisfactory. There would not be any staff saving if people were employed to give advice when they would otherwise, presumably, be granting certificates.<br><br>
I am quite sure that institutions will be able to take advice, because we know that there is regular contact between the Revenue and institutions and companies. What are individuals supposed to do if they want, for good reason, to find out whether they hold a qualifying policy, or whether it was qualifying for the duration of its term? Should they telephone the Revenue for advice? Anyone who has ever telephoned a Government agency will know that that is not as easy as it might sound. If they were able to get advice, the cost involved would be quite substantial.<br><br>
The Government say that their reform is deregulatory, but the deregulation seems to involve the Government, who can wash their hands of responsibility because they will no longer be certifying. They will be authorising advice that cannot be relied upon. The public will have less protection, but will face the same costs. The Government have suggested there would be less work for Ministers, and that if there were a dispute, it could go to court. Perhaps that is true. However, the Minister should remind us of the provisions relating to Crown immunity. I am pretty sure that the Inland Revenue would still be covered, unless matters have changed in the recent past. It is not satisfactory for the Government to turn to the public and say, "We are deregulating everything. All you have to do is to see some lawyers and fight it out in the courts." People who want to buy policies do not want to be bothered like that. There will be the same amount of red tape—it is merely being moved from the Government's responsibility to that of someone else.<br><br>
The Government have not explained why the new system—which involves advice rather than certification—is better. It is not good enough to say that the new rules will be new, improved and simpler—rather like a new soap powder—when the Minister is unable to tell us anything further. That is no way to legislate. It is high time that that was made abundantly clear to the Government, particularly the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall have another shot at explaining the purpose of, and need for, the clause to the hon. Members for Edinburgh, Central and for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson). I acknowledge that a number of important points were made, especially about the future of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0658">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 269</span>
10-year policies and savings plans, which are of keen interest to many people, not least the elderly.<br><br>
Article 5 of the EC third life insurance directive, which came into force on 1 July 1994, inserts a new article into the first EC life directive, which provides, among other things, that:
<br><blockquote><p>"Member States shall not adopt provisions requiring the prior approval or systematic notification of general and special policy conditions…or of forms and other printed documents which an undertaking intends to use in its dealings with policyholders."</p></blockquote>
Since 1 April 1976, a policy of life insurance may only be a "qualifying" policy if it or a model form of the policy has been certified by the Inland Revenue. The Inland Revenue has received advice that prior certification of qualifying policies is probably incompatible with the terms of the EC third life insurance directive provision, which I have just mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Probably"—that is the Minister's advice. What would happen if certification happened after a policy, not prior to it? The Minister said that certification prior to a policy would not be compatible with the directive. Would certification after a policy be compatible?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The article in the directive to which I referred mentions not just prior approval, but systematic notification of general and special policy conditions, so that would also be incompatible.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
While that may be the origin of the change that is being introduced today, it is important that the subject of qualifying policies should be reviewed from time to time. Our intention is that the 10-year rule will be reviewed and discussed with the industry in the course of the next year. The points made by the hon. Gentleman on the inappropriateness or possible inflexibility of that rule for more elderly savers is one of the issues that will be considered. There is no reason why we should be absolutely bound by past practice. The hon. Gentleman will know that the essential elements for qualification are that the plan must be a regular longer-term savings plan of 10 years with a high life assurance element. Times, fashions, products and competition change, as do the requirements in Europe, and the matter will be reviewed with the industry during the next year.<br><br>
Under clause 49(4), once certification has been abolished, there will be no need for insurers to provide policyholders with a certificate. Insurers will still have to disclose the nature of their product and the hon. Gentleman will be aware that new requirements on disclosure came into effect from the beginning of this year, so protection still exists. Apart from the fact that it would not be compatible with the directive, there should be no need for a certificate to be passed on from the policy provider to policyholders if a certificate is not given by the Inland Revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, which is arguable, is the Minister confirming that the policyholder should have no idea whatever whether the policy is certified? If there is no certificate, can consideration be given to another form of notification on request by the policyholder?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 270</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I readily acknowledge that the point being made by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South is important. There is no difference between us and I, too, am keen that policyholders should be not just aware but considerably more aware in future of the terms of the product that they are purchasing. That is why the new regime of disclosure, which requires the full terms, status and standing of a life assurance savings product to be disclosed, will be so important in the market place.<br><br>
That is only one part of notifying or communicating with the policyholder on the appropriateness of a particular investment product in which he or she is investing. Certification should not necessarily play a role when there is no official certification being given by the Inland Revenue We would expect that, as part of the disclosure provisions, policy suppliers will give a clear picture of the tax standing and benefits of a specific product. But in the stable of investment, savings and insurance products which they offer, there will be a myriad of different reliefs and standing for particular products. There is no need, by law, to pass on a certificate when the certification process from the Inland Revenue has been discontinued. That does not and should not mean—I apologise for labouring the point—that there is not a clear responsibility. From the beginning of this year, there is a stronger requirement on product providers to spell out clearly the term, standing and status, as well as the tax status, of the products that they are selling to policyholders.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Law Society has written to us saying that it minks that the clause will impose some unnecessary restrictions on reinsurance. Will the Minister say whether that is true and whether he or the Inland Revenue want to clarify that point?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 271</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing in the clause to stop an insurer using traditional reinsurance to protect itself against the risk that more of its policyholders will die or will suffer sickness or accidents earlier than expected. The restriction in paragraph (f) applies in relation to the reinsurance of the investment element of a policy of life insurance or an annuity contract. Reinsurance of the investment element can easily lead to no tax being paid on it, even if the nominal rate of tax is 20 per cent. or more. That is the mischief that we have addressed in schedule 8 in relation to UK-based insurers. Failure to deal with that in the clause would, undoubtedly, lead to a large loss of business for our domestic insurance industry and a large loss of tax for the Exchequer.<br><br>
Included in clause 50 is a measure that will ensure that the relief provided by the clause will be given only where tax is being borne by the insurer on the income and gains which, ultimately, benefit the policyholder. If the relief were available even when reinsurance had been used to avoid that tax charge, the effect of schedule 8 might be simply to drive policyholders into the arms of another European insurer, which would be bad for the UK insurance industry and bad for the Exchequer.<br><br>
We do not anticipate that many cases will arise in which reinsurance arrangements will be used by a foreign insurer with the aim of helping UK policyholders to avoid tax, but the Inland Revenue will keep a close watch for such arrangements.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 53, in page 48, line 12, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(6) In section 591 the following shall be inserted after subsection 591(2)(h).</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'(i) which allows for a payment of income otherwise than by way of annuity as an alternative to the payment of a pension and a lump sum on death after such payments of income have commenced provided death occurs before the age of 75'.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would give effect to the position that we advocated when debating clause 52 on the Floor of the House. It relates to the flexibility that we believe should be afforded to certain pension holders. The Committee will recall that in clause 52 the Government allow a greater flexibility to permit people to defer having to purchase an annuity in respect of personal pensions. There was support on both sides of the House for ensuring that that flexibility should be extended to other pensions, such as occupational pensions, and certain other retirement annuity benefits.<br><br>
As I understand it, the Government were not unsympathetic. The Financial Secretary took the view that that could be done anyway or, if not, people could opt to transfer. He made the point that we should not nod
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 272</span>
through legislation that would put pressure on people to transfer unnecessarily, which would be wholly undesirable considering all the difficulties that have occurred because of pension transfers.<br><br>
In the light of what the Minister has said, we have tabled an amendment which we believe would give a greater degree of flexibility. We have done so to find out whether the Government have had further discussions in the two or three weeks since we debated the matter. The Minister said that such discussions would take place in the search for greater flexibility. All hon. Members as a matter of principle that there should be flexibility. What divides us is only how best to achieve it.<br><br>
I restate my point that, given the history of pension transfers, we should not force people to transfer to a private pension. If they choose to do that, that is fine, but it should be because there are good reasons to do so and not because they are forced to do so by Government policy. We had enough of Government policy encouraging people to transfer in the late 1980s, and just look at the difficulties that that has caused. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us whether the Government have made any progress because we believe that the amendment would give a far greater degree of flexibility, which most people want.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central said, the issue was discussed at length in Committee of the whole House on clause 52 and schedule 11 relating to personal pensions. I made it clear during that debate that we fully support the principle that members of money-purchased occupational pension schemes should be able to benefit from flexibility in the timing of their annuity purchases. Unlike the situation with personal pensions, however, there is no need for legislation in this case to achieve that, so the amendment is not necessary. Certain occupational pension schemes, known as small self-administered schemes, for many years have had the flexibility to choose a suitable time for purchasing an annuity. Tax requirements for those schemes were further eased in May 1994 to allow the purchase of an annuity to be deferred up to the age of 75—in other words, broadly the same rules as those we have introduced in the Bill for holders of personal pensions.<br><br>
As for other types of occupational pension scheme, there is no specific requirement in the tax approval rules for annuities to be purchased, although pensions have to be paid following retirement. Following the Budget day announcement about personal pensions, we have made it clear that we should be happy to discuss the issue with the sponsors of occupational pension schemes. Some discussions have been held between the Inland Revenue and interested bodies and have shown up no shortcomings in the tax approval legislation that would impede the introduction of flexibility in that matter.<br><br>
If, as a result of those discussions with the sponsors of the schemes, some changes prove desirable, we shall consider introducing suitable measures. With that reassurance and commitment—if it can be called a commitment to say that we shall consider the matter should problems arise—I hope that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central will agree that the amendment is unnecessary.</span></p>

<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced, but what concerns me more is that the Minister seems to have shifted his ground a little from the debate on the Floor of the House. I had understood that he accepted that there were some difficulties, if not in the law, in the practice of the Inland Revenue. The practice of the Inland Revenue seems to be the problem, not primary legislation.<br><br>
Many hon. Members, on both sides of the House, thought that we must have flexibility. I think that the Financial Secretary said—the Government adopted the attitude from an early stage—that people could always transfer to a private pension if, through their existing scheme, they did not have the flexibility that they wanted. I said that, as a matter of principle, I did not think that the Government should introduce legislation that forces, compels or makes people more likely to transfer when they would not otherwise do so.<br><br>
It can be difficult to obtain that flexibility in some forms of occupational pension because of the practice of the Inland Revenue. That is why I understood the Minister to have indicated that discussions would take place. Today, he said that discussions had been held and that it had been agreed that there was no obstacle. He went on to say that, if an obstacle should arise in the continuing discussions, the Government would be pleased to hear of it. Those statements seem incompatible.<br><br>
Flexibility is extremely important. If there is flexibility for one sort of pension holder, there should be flexibility for other sorts. I notice that relief is coming to the Minister; whether or not he wants to get to his feet again I do not know, but if he does not I am not at all persuaded by his reasoning and shall not withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly rise to my feet again, not because I am frightened of a Division, but to persuade the hon. Gentleman that he may have misunderstood the matter.<br><br>
During the debate on the Floor of the House, I said that, as far as we were aware, there was no problem with flexibility in occupational pension schemes. Nothing in the law inhibited flexibility from being built into such schemes by those who run them. An occupational pension scheme is fundamentally different from a personal pension plan because there is not one stock of money being built up through one person, but a flow of funds being built up over a period. The interests of several beneficiaries need to be taken into account. That is why there should always be a choice. We intend to introduce and to preserve as much flexibility as possible. With respect, we do not need lectures from the hon. Gentleman about introducing flexibility into pensions. That is what we have tried to do since 1988 with a good deal of success—albeit with some associated risks and problems. We need to acknowledge that risks often come with different choices. The possibility of less advantageous results is almost inevitable when a variety of different provisions are available in the market place.<br><br>
I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman was thinking of our partial debate on retirement annuity contracts which, although related to the subject we are discussing, is different from it. The debate involved some
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 274</span>
Conservative Members. However, there should be no misunderstanding about what was said about occupational pension schemes at the time. All I have said today is that some discussions have taken place with people in the industry and the Inland Revenue and, so far, those discussions have revealed no shortcomings. I do not know whether I can say much more than that—if shortcomings become evident from future discussions, we are prepared to reconsider the issue. There is no point in drafting into law changes that we do not consider necessary and that try to solve a problem that does not currently exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot let the Minister get away with one of his statements. He said that the Government should be praised for introducing flexibility since 1988. All of us support flexibility; our complaint is about the Government's actions in the late 1980s, as evidenced by that ridiculous television advert with a man in a straitjacket breaking free from public provision and going private. We remember that that advertisement led people to believe that the very act of going private was enriching—in the literal sense of that word—in itself. That is why so many people fell easy prey to unscrupulous salesmen from unscrupulous insurance companies, who sold them policies that were entirely inappropriate for them, with the result that there are now many people who may have bought personal pensions that were wholly inappropriate to their needs.<br><br>
I am surprised that the Minister, who is also responsible for the regulation of the financial services industry, should describe that industry in wholly beneficial terms. That is simply not the case. I believe that there should be flexibility, but in the light of experience, we must be careful.<br><br>
The Minister should not look quizzical at that remark. Flexibility means that people should be able to choose whether they want a private pension or an occupational pension. They should have that choice. The Government should never have mounted a propaganda exercise deliberately designed to persuade people that unless they had a private pension plan they would lose out.<br><br>
The Government engaged in a confidence trick of disgraceful proportions in the late 1980s and we might think that they would have learnt from that before introducing legislation and issuing the statement—as I believe the Financial Secretary did through a Treasury press release—that if people did not have flexible occupational pensions, they could buy a personal pension. We must be very careful about Governments trying to influence people into taking action without the proper safeguards, especially given the fact that the present pension transfer problem is far from resolution. I am surprised at the Government's attitude to that.<br><br>
In his reply, the Minister said that he saw no difficulty with the pension law. What I asked about was the practice of the Inland Revenue, which is a slightly different matter. Our information is that there is still difficulty. It is important that we put on record that there must be flexibility. I appreciate that the schemes are funded in a different way, but whether a scheme is to be flexible or not is a matter not for Parliament but for those who administer the scheme. Our sole concern in respect of taxation is that we should not needlessly distort people's choices.</span></p>

FOLLOW-UP TESSAs</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Helen Liddell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for long, but I am worried about the clause as it relates to follow-up tax-exempt special savings accounts. We have an opportunity to reflect on the first five years of the TESSA scheme. When the then Chancellor introduced TESSAs in his 1990 Budget, he claimed that the aim was to extend savings incentives provided by the tax system
<br><blockquote><p>"to the mass of ordinary taxpaying savers who prefer to put their money in the familiar security of high street banks and building societies."</p></blockquote>
In explaining the Government's decision to introduce the new scheme, he stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"I believe it is economically right to encourage savings and I believe also that it is socially right".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 20 March 1990; Vol. 169, <i>c.</i> 1027.]</p></blockquote>
At least that is something on which we can agree with the now Prime Minister.<br><br>
I do not share the opinion of some economists that the savings and investment ratio is no longer relevant to the modern economy because globalisation of markets has led to leakages in the system. I am worried about the significance of savings and investment in the modern economy. I am also worried that the profits to be gained by those who merely move money around the system discourages investment in aspects of our economy such as research and development and the manufacturing industry.<br><br>
My concern about TESSAs is that the £21 billion that has been raised from the 4 million people who have invested in them goes straight into the financial institutions in the conventional sense. It is a source of regret to me that the opportunity has not been taken to introduce a more imaginative approach to TESSAs which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 276</span>
could have more effectively married the need for productive investment in our economy with the encouragement of savings.<br><br>
I well understand the arguments of building societies about the dangers of the failure to produce a follow-up to the system of TESSAs. It was obvious when TESSAs were introduced, to become active in 1991, that at the end of the first five-year period there would be a serious risk of leakage from building society accounts and that that would cause building societies some difficulty. Now that we are reflecting on that first five-year period, I cannot understand why the opportunity has been missed in the follow-up provisions to bring about changes in the system of TESSAs to improve the efficiency of the scheme and to encourage savings. We have missed the opportunity to refine the system and to mirror what is, in effect, the Government's agenda to encourage savings.<br><br>
During the Standing Committee debate on TESSAs in 1990, the then Financial Secretary stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"TESSA is aimed at the ordinary person and, because of that, we based the scheme on the most simple and straightforward form of saving—putting money into a high street bank or building society … If we are to influence people's decisions at the margins between saving and spending"—</p></blockquote>
I reiterate that this is about influencing people's decisions at the margins between saving and spending—
<br><blockquote><p>"rather than just affecting the choice between different ways of saving, it is absolutely right to target the most simple and familiar form of saving."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 16 May 1990; Vol. 172, <i>c.</i> 955.]</p></blockquote>
That is a commendable attitude for a Financial Secretary to adopt. However, the quest for simplicity and ease of use has been frustrated on a number of counts.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
My attention has been drawn by the Association of British Insurers to the fact that TESSAs and the associated scheme of PEPs are being used by the more sophisticated saver who can negotiate the schemes' complexities. Indeed, schemes such as those provide an opportunity for sophisticated investors who are better off to shelter the whole of their investments, while at the same time poorer people—the people whom TESSAs are supposed to target—and ordinary savers for whom saving is difficult are having their prudence penalised because they can save only through bank and building society deposits and life insurance policies that are heavily taxed. Poorer savers cannot afford to lock away their funds for five years. They need ease and speed of access. That system cannot be equitable. I think, too, that the lack of fairness is exacerbated by the proposal to abolish the save-as-you-earn scheme, which was introduced by the 1969 Labour Government to encourage the small saver.<br><br>
I acknowledge that this subject is to be debated at a later stage, but it is relevant here in connection with the impact on the small saver of follow-on TESSAs. If the Government are genuine in their commitment to encourage and assist the man or woman in the street, the amendment to TESSAs to encompass the smaller saver should have been made. There are shortcomings in the existing operation of TESSAs and the opportunity to correct them has been missed. Those on low incomes cannot take advantage of the attractions of TESSAs because they cannot afford to lock up funds for five years. Therefore, they lose out on the tax relief that was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0662">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 277</span>
available to them during the first five-year period, as well as the ability to roll over capital into a further five-year tax-exempt scheme.<br><br>
Will the Minister tell us what plans the Government have to tap what savings are available for the less well-off who are determined to exercise the very prudence of which Conservative Members often remind us? Prudence is in the background of the back-to-basics slogan. I hope that I do not cause offence by mentioning that phrase, given that its more meaningful use these days is to describe a photograph of a wrecked Trabant in a field of green leaves, such as the one which is in the photographic exhibition in the Foyer.<br><br>
When we reflect on the next phase of TESSAs, it is important to analyse its impact in attracting additional savings. That issue was raised when TESSAs were first introduced and it was a significant part of that debate. It is now time to have a proper examination of the need for follow-on TESSAs. That examination cannot be complete without an analysis of how the investment of £21 billion has affected other forms of savings and investment. Has the general pool of saving been extended and, if so, by how much? Or are we just seeing old money being reshuffled? Is the money coming from the sock under the bed or is it coming from building society accounts and other less attractive accounts? Only on that basis will we be able to judge whether the extension of fiscal privilege to the less sophisticated saver was a temporary gimmick or a genuine contribution to encourage the small saver in relation to his more streetwise and richer counterpart.<br><br>
Furthermore, will the Minister tell us what analysis has been done of the different performances of TESSAs and their impact on the overall pool of savings? According to an analysis published in the <i>Financial Times</i> on 3 December 1994, the performance of TESSAs has varied widely—as all of us know who watch such matters—and the fluctuations in base rates have affected the attractiveness of TESSAs.<br><br>
When TESSAs were introduced, there was a frenzied period of advertising by building societies, which indulged in fierce competition to attract savings through TESSAs. As a result, the savings institutions have turned what was publicised as an uncomplicated investment vehicle into a complex and confusing one.<br><br>
Given the scheme's initial intentions, reducing complexity should be taken into account as we consider follow-up TESSAs. Indeed, the potential to complicate what is already becoming an increasingly complex system will be directly affected by the introduction of the follow-up scheme. Already, we have witnessed the impact of loyalty bonuses in attracting people to TESSAs. Will further loyalty bonuses and differential interest rates be offered to increase the attractiveness of follow-up TESSAs?<br><br>
An examination of the impact of TESSAs on the overall savings market in their first five years of operation—which is best done as we enter 1996—leads me to share the view of the study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which was outlined in the <i>Financial Times</i> in September 1994. It said that inequality in wealth in the United Kingdom was further exacerbated in that the savings of the poor were apt to be taxed at a much higher rate than those of the rich.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 278</span>
The rich had options in their savings methods; the poor did not.<br><br>
According to that study, the average amount of wealth held by households in Britain is £3,000, excluding pensions and housing. However, that overall figure is badly skewed by a large number of extremely wealthy individuals. It is estimated that of the surveyed households, about half have annual savings of less than £450.<br><br>
Those poorer households attract higher rates of taxation because of the way in which they have to hold their savings. We need a system that encourages small savers and gives them the opportunities they need for speed and ease of access. I accept that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee recognise that fiscal prudence has been further penalised by the Chancellor's decision to abolish save-as-you-earn schemes—one of the oldest tax-free schemes for savers.<br><br>
As mentioned this morning, there are several by-election victors among Labour members of the Committee who are allegedly on the Committee because of the strong-arm tactics of Labour Whips. That is a ludicrous assertion. I am prepared to accept that there are few Conservative members of the Committee with recent memories of the enthusiasm of by-election victors.<br><br>
I crave the indulgence of Conservative Members and ask a question of the Financial Secretary. Clause 56 empowers the Board of Inland Revenue to make regulations governing follow-up TESSAs. Why are the Government so keen to lecture us on other subjects about the sovereignty of Parliament in relation to Europe, yet prepared to remove more power from Parliament to the Executive and its agencies? Furthermore, why have the Government chosen this complex method of extending the maturity of TESSAs? Why not simply extend TESSAs' maturity to a period of ten years?<br><br>
In a Bill that stretches to 348 pages, repeated use is made of secondary and tertiary legislation. I could take an uncharitable view and say that that is for purposes of obfuscation or of providing fees to those who make their living from giving financial advice. As a new Member of Parliament I am concerned about the extent to which the legislative measures being used by the Government limit the scope of Parliament. I would welcome an explanation of why the Government have chosen such a technique.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister introduced his first and only Budget as Chancellor of the Exchequer in March 1990, he was especially keen to help the small saver. Two measures in particular illustrated that—first, the introduction of TESSAs, which were a complete novelty; and secondly, the abolition of the composite rate of tax which had penalised small savers who had to pay the lower rate of tax even if they were not taxpayers. Today it is possible for people who are not taxpayers to have the interest paid gross on a building society account.<br><br>
TESSAs, as we have heard, were introduced in 1991 and I believe that they have been a great success. It is always hard to be sure how much of any new tax relief is dead weight—that is to say, it simply attracts savings, in this case, from other savings media into a tax-free environment. Nobody would suggest that PEPs encouraged a great deal of new saving—they were designed to encourage people to save in equities—but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0663">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 279</span>
TESSAs gave small savers the incentive to save for the first time. As the hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) said, when they were introduced in early 1991 there was tremendous competition from the savings institutions to attract savers to their particular brand of TESSA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that there are approximately 4 million accounts at present. I wonder how many are new accounts. When there was uncertainty as to whether the Government would extend the TESSA regime, many other institutions thought that they might get some of those savers back. I do not doubt that there have been new additions, but does the hon. Gentleman know what the net gain is?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know, but perhaps my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary might be able to enlighten us. I have already conceded that there is bound to be an element of dead weight. I do not think that it is possible to devise a tax relief that does not involve some element of dead weight. However, I would like to think that a reasonable proportion of the 4 million accounts are those of new savers who were drawn into saving for the first time by a very attractive arrangement designed to help the people at the bottom of the pile to save at least a small amount of money every month or every year. It has been a great success and I am very pleased that it is to be extended.<br><br>
Amendment No. 133 was not selected for some reason, but perhaps I could mention briefly the issue to which it refers. It was a matter raised by the Institute of Taxation, which questioned the need for the new section 326 BB(1)(b), which says that
<br><blockquote><p>"the total amount deposited in the matured account, before it matured, exceeded £3,000".</p></blockquote>
The institute has suggested that the £3,000 minimum prescribed in the Bill could prejudice a taxpayer whose maturing TESSA yielded slightly less than £3,000. Perhaps my right hon. Friend could comment on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sir George Young)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall begin by dealing with the last point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield on whether there is any prejudice to savers whose maturing TESSAs yield less than £3,000. I assure him that the clause does not have the effect that he feared and creates only new rights for savers with TESSAs. It will allow account holders who have saved more than £3,000 in a TESSA which matures after five years to roll over the whole amount deposited, not including any interest, at any time in the first year of a follow-up account, provided that account is opened within six months of maturity.<br><br>
The new rules apply only to those who have deposited more than £3,000 in their matured account because those who have deposited less than £3,000 can already, under existing law, open a new TESSA with that amount in it. People who have saved less than £3,000 in their first account will be no worse off under the new rules. As soon as their first TESSA matured, they would always have been able to open a new account and deposit up to £3,000 in the first year. They will remain able to do so, and they can top it up at £1,800 a year, subject to the £9,000 ceiling. The amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, which was not called, was not necessary either.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 280</span>
6.15 pm<br><br>
The hon. Member for Monklands, East made an interesting speech that raised several points. She seemed to be expecting one savings instrument to hit a range of targets, rather than a range of savings instruments, which could, between them, have hit the totality of the targets. One criticism that the hon. Lady made of TESSAs was that they were not directly linked to industrial investment. She said that the investment went to banks and building societies, whereas she wanted to see it invested directly in manufacturing or product investment. The fact that money is invested through a TESSA in a bank does not mean that it is not subsequently lent to an industry that is productive. The money does not disappear. Likewise, if it goes into a building society, it might be used to help the construction industry. Of course, for those who want to invest directly in new investment, there are other savings vehicles, which we shall discuss later, including the venture capital trust and the enterprise investment scheme. Other savings instruments are available to other savers. Banks and building societies offer deposit accounts for sums of money which can be easily withdrawn and which are convenient for the small saver.<br><br>
An Administration should have a range of savings investments which meet a number of targets, and which, between them, amount to a successful strategy for investment. That is preferable to considering one investment strategy, such as a TESSA, and criticising it because it is not directly linked. The hon. Lady should consider the total spectrum rather than focus on one part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise two issues. First, the direct relationship between productive investment and the investment from small savers is important. Whenever a small saver invests, inevitably the money goes into a financial institution, and there is no control over how those investments are used. The role of the small saver in the economy would be increased if there were a direct link by which people could see how their money was being invested. The larger investors tend to have the luxury of being able to track what their money is being used for.<br><br>
Secondly, I fully accept that there is a range of savings and investment instruments. However—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady made an interesting, but not too brief, speech during the clause stand part debate. Unfortunately, her intervention is now assuming extraordinary proportions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with the point that the hon. Lady made about transparency—about how the investor should be able to see what his or her investment is doing. To some extent, that is done by unit trusts and by venture capital trusts. When a quoted collective investment vehicle links into other unquoted investment vehicles, there would then be a direct relationship between the investment and the success of the underlying investments.<br><br>
The unsophisticated saver may prefer to have an intermediary who is in charge of the investment. With an intermediary, one does not obtain quite the same transparency. One obtains greater security, but one gives up transparency—one needs a range of options.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0664">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 281</span>
Direct exposure to high-risk new companies may not be right for the less-well-off saver. Perhaps a TESSA would be the right approach, it extends some of the tax privileges for equity investment to the less-well-off saver. I was not clear what the hon. Lady thought of TESSAs. I believe that they are a successful and popular form of saving that which deserve to be extended, as the clause will do. I am not sure what the Opposition's view of TESSAs is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask a semi-rhetorical question. The Government must have considered what might have happened had TESSAs not been renewed. What do the Government think would have happened to those 4 million accounts? Would they have been removed from the system altogether or would they have gone somewhere else?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting question. As the hon. Gentleman knows, building societies were worried that funds might leave the building societies. We consider TESSAs to be a worthwhile means of saving and that those who have saved in the scheme should have an opportunity to renew it. Tol that extent, therefore, the question should not arise because of the opportunity for renewal. However, the hon. Member for Monklands, East referred back to the original debates. I did likewise. I note that on 16 May 1990 one of her colleagues, the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) said that that Budget was one of small measures and that TESSAs are one such measure. Since then, £22 billion has been invested in more than 4 million accounts. That forecast of what would happen to TESSAs may not have been the most perceptive.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, TESSAs were introduced in 1991. They are special bank and building society accounts that allow savers to receive tax-free interest on their savings, provided certain conditions are satisfied. A TESSA lasts five years. Any interest earned on the account after that time becomes taxable. Under current rules investors can open a new TESSA—a follow-up account—with a maximum first-year deposit of £3,000, after maturity of the first TESSA.<br><br>
TESSAs have proved successful. We want to encourage people to continue to save and to hold on to savings that they have built up in their account. The clause would increase the first-year deposit limit for follow-up TESSAs to allow investors to deposit up to the full amount of capital but not the accumulated interest that they had held in their first TESSA until maturity.<br><br>
Someone who has deposited the maximum allowed of £9,000 in their first TESSA will be able to deposit up to that amount in the first year of a follow-up TESSA. An investor who wishes to take advantage of the increased deposit limit will need to open a follow-up TESSA within six months of maturity of the first TESSA.<br><br>
The tax benefits available from TESSAs are valuable and we want to ensure that only those who deposited more than £3,000 in their TESSA, which they have held to maturity, are able to deposit more than £3,000 in the first year of a follow-up TESSA.<br><br>
The hon. Lady grumbled about the regulations. The Bill would be even longer if it had included all the measures that we are giving the Inland Revenue power to carry out
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 282</span>
by regulation. To reassure her about the regulations, I say that they will only apply to administrative arrangements that the Inland Revenue needs to introduce to deal with the administration of the scheme. We plan to proceed by agreement with the institutions. That is the normal way of dealing with schemes such as this one.<br><br>
The clause's provisions would enable regulations to be made that require institutions to verify an investor's right to the increased first-year deposit limit before it accepts deposits in excess of £3,000. That will be done by reference to its own records, if it held the first account, or to a certificate from another institution if the investor opens a follow-up account with a different institution from that with which the first account was held.<br><br>
The hon. Lady asked several questions in her interesting speech. Inevitably different institutions will offer different rates. That is how the market works. Potential investors need to decide with which institution they plan to invest. TESSAs need to be seen as part of a balanced savings policy with different instruments focused on different people. For the poorer, less sophisticated saver, the bank or local building society may be the best store for their funds.<br><br>
The maturity of the TESSA presents an opportunity to liquidate the first tranche of savings after five years or, if people prefer, they can sign on for another five years.<br><br>
I have dealt with most issues that were raised in the debate. I detect no great hostility either to TESSAs or to their renewal. I hope that the Committee supports the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a brief contribution. The Financial Secretary asked about the Labour party's position. If he wants to examine it, I set it out clearly in an article for the <i>Sunday Express</i> a couple of weeks ago and I am not going to repeat it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Never read it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that will come as a blow to the publishers of that newspaper.<br><br>
We support measures such as TESSAs and PEPs, which encourage savings. However, our debate demonstrates the need for a proper review of overall savings policy. I made a point to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield about the number of people who have begun to save who would not otherwise have done so. That factor should be examined to determine its effect. If people who would have saved anyway are simply moving their savings to TESSAs, we must question whether the Government are using the tax system in an efficient and effective way. The Government should reflect on that. We have to keep an eye on developments so that TESSAs and PEPs avoid becoming the mortgage tax relief of the future. So many people would become locked into the tax system that the Government could not, for a variety of reasons, have an opportunity to review it.<br><br>
The need for a savings review is overwhelming. The Government might perform a useful public service if they published what they know so far and at least stimulate such a debate. We welcome the measures dealing with TESSAs and PEPs, but we have to examine the way in which they work: how many people are saving who would not otherwise have done so, how sensible is the use of the tax system and, as my hon. Friend the Member for

Monklands, East said about PEPs, are we channelling investment into areas that would not otherwise receive it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to respond. I am worried about the recent overreaching use of tertiary legislation. At the end of 1993, there were 165 live extra-statutory concessions, compared with 62 in 1970 and 94 in 1979. The novelty of the system makes me concerned that the opportunity for Parliament to debate such matters fully has not been taken. Perhaps it is because of my enthusiasm to serve on the Committee that I am undaunted by the prospect of having to face an even larger Finance Bill.<br><br>
Some points were not explained fully, not the least of which was the analysis of the impact on additional savings—the extent to which the market has been enlarged and money moved around. That is a crucial element of the debate about the shape of savings and the mix of opportunities available to savers. There should be a mix of opportunities, but the point has been missed about the availability of instruments that truly reflect the needs of the very small saver, who perhaps is in the band with an annual saving of £450 a year. The opportunity to reward that prudence has been missed.<br><br>
As for TESSAs, I approve of systems that encourage savings. The role of savings in our economy is important and the role that investment plays in relation to savings is crucial. The Minister took issue with something that I said earlier. It related to the fact that people appreciate recognising more intimately where their savings are being used. We have seen that happen in recent years, especially with those who have been unhappy about the way in which their pension funds have been invested. There will be a growing trend among savers to take an interest in where their funds are invested. I am also concerned about the extent to which financial institutions can siphon off aspects of the savings ratio through fees and commissions.<br><br>
Those are my main concerns about the clause. I welcome the opportunity to have this debate on clause 56. I hope that the Government will reflect on the inefficiencies of the TESSA system. At the end of five years, it is inevitable that some aspects of that will have to be examined, and I hope that that will happen.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall keep my comments brief—I have just had my collar felt.<br><br>
I want to talk about the powers of the Board of Inland Revenue to make regulations under the clause, or, as the case may be, not to make regulations since it says that the board "may" make regulations.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 284</span>
6.30 pm<br><br>
I hope that when the Chief Secretary responds he will not say, as he did on a similar issue on clause 45, that the Government are simply following precedent. We are dealing with unknown territory because the clause refers to a regime that the Board of Inland Revenue may apply or other arrangements that the board thinks fit which should ensure that organisations from other EU member states with no presence or branch in this country comply broadly with the present regulations.<br><br>
The principle of the opportunity of business in the European Union is welcomed particularly by the ABI, but there are differing systems to be considered as well as the step into the unknown. Several of my hon. Friends have referred to different taxation systems and other differences in previous debates. It remains to be seen how qualifying institutions from the European Union market their TESSAs for small investors and how attractive such a scheme will be from an institution with no base in the United Kingdom. The clause deals with organisations that may have a base in Italy, Greece or Luxembourg, but not in the UK.<br><br>
In considering those regulations, the board will be required to take into account two basic requirements. The institution from another member state will be required to appoint a person responsible for securing the discharge of prescribed duties. Again, the prescribed duties are explained in the clause as those which are broadly consistent with the TESSA regulations in the UK. That is extremely important because, presumably, the Government are seeking to ensure that, in broad terms, the regime that covers the TESSA system in this country is also applied to organisations without a base in this country.<br><br>
That seems quite sensible, but it is not so obviously sensible that the Board of Inland Revenue will be empowered to endorse a person that the institution has nominated to ensure the securing of those discharges. That is how I understand the clause as drafted. The institution trying to sell TESSAs without a base in this country will appoint a person to discharge the requirements laid down by the Government.<br><br>
There are two issues involved here. On is the desirability and credibility of a system that allows an institution trying to market the scheme with no base in this country to appoint the person with the responsibility of discharging the requirements laid down by the Government, which aim to secure in broad terms the same regime that applies to TESSAs in this country. There is a certain illogicality and inconsistency in that. I hope that the Financial Secretary will clarify that apparent illogicality and perhaps give some indication of how the Government plan to address the inconsistency.<br><br>
The board has the widest possible brief to draw up the regulations, but I want to emphasise that the object of those regulations will be not to monitor or to review, but to secure the discharge of the requirements that I mentioned previously—in broad terms, that is to ensure that they are compatible with this country's regulations. A clear distinction is drawn between the monitoring and supervisory role and the responsibility to secure those requirements. For the institution that is seeking to do business to appoint the person whose job it is to secure those requirements is a cause of considerable concern.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0666">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 285</span>
The requirement under subsection (5) provides for the Board of Inland Revenue to make regulations that appoint the day from which European institutions may offer TESSAs. That raises important issues. What about the small investor? A small investor may be offered an attractive package by a qualifying institution from another European Union member state, which has no base in this country. The investor cannot simply pop into the local office and ask questions, which is an important safeguard. The small investor then asks how the provisions for securing the requirements that govern TESSAs in this country will be put into practice in terms of the investment that he is about to make. If the regulations are not made before the appointed day, the response will be that no one knows.<br><br>
Presumably, the investor will then go to his Member of Parliament and ask what are to be the regulations that will secure his interests because he is going to make an investment in TESSA offered by a company that has no base in this country. How is his Member of Parliament to advise him that his interests will be secured as clause 57 requires? Unless the regulations are made before the appointed day, that Member of Parliament will be forced to say that he or she does not know what the regulations will be.<br><br>
I emphasise how important it is that the regulations—as minimal as they are under clause 57—are made before the appointed day—before the Board of Inland Revenue, as indicated under subsection (5), appoint the day from which European institutions may offer TESSAs. Unless those conditions are met, problems will arise as people seek to take advantage of packages offered by qualified institutions.<br><br>
I readily accept that my last point is somewhat subjective, but I detect a new approach developing. When we considered the issue of reinsurance, the Minister said that draft regulations would be published and that consultation would take place because there was a need for that—presumably in the interests of the industry. Other clauses require the Revenue to be notified about any gains made, under the penalty of near death. Yet when it comes to the interests of customers, the Government's approach is entirely different.<br><br>
First, the Board of Inland Revenue is given discretion on whether to produce regulations. Secondly, responsibility is handed to the institution that seeks to market its own package. Thirdly, the appointed day on which institutions from member states of the European Union are entitled to offer their package will be before even the minimal regulations are in place. There is one approach to the interests of the industry and the Revenue. Regulations will be produced in draft and be subject to consultation to ensure that the interests of the Revenue and the small investment industry are protected. There is a subtle but important difference in the approach to the small investor with discretion, indistinction and obfuscation in the way in which their interests will be protected.<br><br>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will respond to those matters and clarify them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter for regret that the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) will be unable to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 286</span>
shed light on this debate because he is shedding light on another one.<br><br>
The debate should be put into perspective. The clause extends the range of people who may offer TESSAs from United Kingdom institutions to European institutions. So far, only one European institution has expressed interest in coming within the TESSA framework so the scenario of lots of small savers investing in TESSAs through an organisation based overseas is unlikely. Most would choose their local bank or building society rather than a European institution. I assure the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South that we shall not appoint the day until the regulations are in place.<br><br>
Why do we need the regulations? The TESSA legislation imposes compliance obligations on institutions that operate TESSAs. For example, they must maintain a record of investors so that the Inland Revenue may check up to ensure that no one has more than one. It is right that European institutions should be subject to the same regulations as United Kingdom institutions. Those regulations in which the hon. Gentleman expressed interest simply extend to European institutions existing regulations that apply to United Kingdom ones. I find nothing offensive about that.<br><br>
It is important that a European institution which operates a TESSA should have a tax representative in this country. We must have contact with someone who can provide the necessary information and ensure that there is compliance. It is appropriate for individuals or bodies with a permanent presence in the United Kingdom to assume that role.<br><br>
The legislation sets out provisions under which we shall define who the tax representative may be and the board will have the power to prescribe a range of people able to act as fiscal representatives or other intermediaries. Again, I see nothing obnoxious or disturbing about that.<br><br>
In a nutshell, we are simply implementing the second banking directive to allow European institutions to buy TESSAs and we are applying to them the same regimes that apply to the United Kingdom institutions. That is wholly consistent and sensible.</span></p>

<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was delighted to be able to make my maiden speech on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill—and then pleasantly surprised to learn that that meant that I had to serve on this Committee. I shall keep my remarks on the clause brief because much of what I want to say about PEPs can be said when we discuss clause 135.<br><br>
I understand the popularity of personal equity plans. I expect that some Committee members—perhaps a large
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0667">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 287</span>
number—have PEPs. By the end of 1994, about £16 billion was invested in 4.7 million plans. It is possible to invest in plans in each tax year. I believe that there are now opportunities for individuals to invest in some 13 general and company PEP plans. I know several individuals who have invested in such plans and some married couples who are just completing their 26th PEP. That brings me to my question. Does the Financial Secretary have any information about how many individuals and households have taken out plans since the schemes began?<br><br>
PEPs have become so liberalised that, from next April, married couples will be able to invest £18,000 a year in them; another £10,000 in unit trusts, equities or, as is proposed, corporate and other bonds; and another £6,000 in single company PEPs. Therefore, by next year a couple could have invested more than £100,000 in PEPs with tax-free funds growing each year. That has consequences for public finances and it is legitimate to ask whether the current level of PEP limits is acceptable and what would be normal for a small investor. I would also like to know what economic modelling has been undertaken or is planned by the Treasury into the effect on public finances of what has been recognised by one commentator as a potential black hole in public finances as a result of the exemption of PEPs from income tax and capital gains tax.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, East has already mentioned in relation to clause 56, Mark Boleat, the director general of the Association of British Insurers, is on record as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"PEPs and TESSAs are used predominantly by better-off people. They are also used by more sophisticated investors. The Government has produced a tax regime which allows sophisticated, well-off investors to shelter the whole of their investments from tax through PEPs, TESSAs and also other products such as BES schemes and venture capital trusts, while poorer people, who traditionally save through bank and building society deposits and life insurance policies, are heavily taxed. This policy must be questioned on grounds of equity."</p></blockquote>
I want to do just that. I shall be interested to hear the Financial Secretary's justification of that policy and to see how it squares with the intention of the Dorrell review to create a level playing field with respect to savings instruments. I agree with the Financial Secretary that it is necessary to examine the whole spectrum of savings instruments.<br><br>
What is the underlying principle behind the Government's taxation policy on savings? They are clearly moving away from removing the reliefs, but do they now intend to give total exemptions on all types of savings and can we therefore assume that the ABI's request for consideration of PEP-ing life assurance policies will be looked at favourably and that the next step after that is to consider tax relief on building society and bank deposits?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson) has taken the opportunity to take a broader look at PEPs than simply considering the regulations under clause 58. PEPs are important and the hon. Gentleman was right to mention the figure of £16 billion. It is perhaps understandable that he did not immediately add that that was a considerable vindication of a good Conservative policy designed to increase individual investment in equities.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 288</span>
The legislation creating PEPs gave the Government very wide powers to introduce new regulations and to change existing regulations. In practice they have used those powers very well, but many of us have misgivings about giving the Government quite such broad powers to proceed on secondary legislation in a way which is quite unpredictable when a Bill passes through the House of Commons, so this is a good opportunity to see how the general progress of PEPs can be measured in the light of experience.<br><br>
Many hon. Members who have previously served on a Finance Bill Committee may remember that, while I always repeat my great support for the concept of PEPs, I have for many years tried to use the opportunity presented by the Committee to alter the system in two important respects.<br><br>
First, I have been concerned that PEPs are unduly distortionary because only a limited range of instruments can be held in them—originally UK equities and now also European equities and the unit trusts and investment trusts invested in those instruments. That distortion applied not only to the supply side—the flow of savings into PEPs—but to the demand side of the way in which those savings funnelled towards those who use savings in our economy, namely, industrial investors. I was especially concerned that corporate bonds benefited from none of the tax breaks available—such as TESSAs and PEPs—which was an unfortunate distortion.<br><br>
I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Government on addressing that issue and now allowing convertibles and corporate bonds to be included in a PEP. That is a progressive move which removes the distortion for savers. It enables the small saver to have the considerable benefit of an instrument with a higher running yield—the small saver such as a retired person needs that running yield—and to hold an instrument with a lesser degree of risk than applies to the corresponding equity. That is a very good deal for savers, which I hope they take advantage of, and a very good decision by the Government.<br><br>
The second aspect of the amendments and new clauses that I have proposed on this subject in previous years—especially my two attempts in two different years to introduce what I called a personal investment plan—was to lay the basis for a PEP to be run on a self-administered basis. I have been concerned since the start of the scheme that PEPs are very expensive. I have never seen a PEP which costs the investor less than a management charge of 1 per cent. a year. In a typical equity portfolio with a dividend yield of 4 per cent., a quarter of the 4 per cent. will be paid by the saver to the manager. In many cases, that can amount to 1.5 per cent. a year or more. If that saver is a standard income tax payer on a 25 per cent. marginal rate, whereas previously he will have paid a quarter of his dividend yield to the Inland Revenue, he will now pay a quarter of his dividend yield to the plan manager or to the intermediary. What has occurred is not so much a switch of resources from the generality of taxpayers to those who save through PEPs as a switch of resources from the generality of taxpayers to those who manage PEPs. That is not a desirable state of affairs.<br><br>
I was tempted to table an amendment to the clause that would have enabled the Committee to pronounce on the matter and, if the Committee had seen fit, to take the opportunity to allow PEPs in future to be run on a self-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0668">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 289</span>
assessed basis, which is something which I have urged before. I took advice and was told that that would be inappropriate in the context of a narrow clause such as this, which only makes regulations that will enable European fund managers to gain access to the PEP business. I hope to be able to submit a new clause in time that will provide the opportunity to discuss this matter, which, given the sums that we are discussing, is important.<br><br>
I do not want to sit down without having once referred to these specific clauses. They are the equivalent for PEPs of the new regulations that we have just agreed to apply to TESSAs. They are welcome, not only to Conservative Members, who believe in the single market and more competition in financial services but because they address—albeit, I fear, in a small way in practice—the important issue that I have just raised concerning the cost to the saver of the PEP. In the current structure, those who have a franchise hold the keys to the kingdom. Without those intermediaries and plan managers, one cannot obtain a PEP. They achieve the main financial benefit from the arrangement. In so far as competition is enhanced I hope that there will be downward pressure on those management charges. In so far as the regulations encourage plan managers in other parts of the European Union to market PEPs in this country, I hope that that will contribute to the competitive pressures which will be thoroughly desirable to the interests of savers in this country and, therefore, to the interests of the savings ratio.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that, at some point, it will be possible to have a serious debate about savings policy and deal at length with the issues raised by the hon. Members for Dudley, West and my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies). I detect from the body language of some members of the Committee that now may not be the right time for such an extended debate, so I should like to reply briefly to some points and, no doubt, we can return at a later stage to the more philosophical points that were raised.<br><br>
I was slightly worried about the couple whom the hon. Member for Dudley, West referred to as celebrating their 26th PEP. We have had PEPs for nine years. They are allowed two each and so that should amount to 18.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No company PEPs for the first few years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir George Young</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has come to the rescue and has prevented the Inland Revenue from calling quickly on that couple.<br><br>
There are 1.5 million plans—we count plans not plan holders. We have no intention to change the regime. Costs are associated with the exemptions, but they are accommodated within the Government's overall policy. I am delighted by what my hon. Friend said about corporate bonds—not only are they welcome to the saver, who now has access to a slightly different savings instrument but, we hope, a market will develop in corporate bonds so that industry can raise funds other than from the banks using the market generated by the PEPs treatment. I agree with what my hon. Friend said about competition and costs—more competitors in the market should mean that costs will be driven down, benefiting further the PEP investors.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 290</span>
I agree with what he said about broadening the market, increasing the number of shareholders and broadening the base from which industry can eventually raise funds.<br><br>
I detected no disagreement with the thrust of the clause, which extends the range of bodies that are able to become PEP managers to include some European institutions. I hope that that reform will be accepted by the Committee.</span></p>

<p>7 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. At the start of our sitting, before you were in the Chair, Mr. Hogg, one of my hon. Friends drew attention to a reference in <i>The Mail on Sunday,</i> which stated that a number of my hon. Friends were "fresh-faced" and "enthusiastic". The fact that I am speaking might vindicate the description. I do not think that any Labour Member would want to reject the reference that was made in <i>The Mail on Sunday.</i><br><br>
Last week, in a very welcome move, the Prime Minister accepted that the Government had a responsibility for reducing inequality, which has increased massively over the past 15 years. Now the tax burden, as a proportion of income, is significantly greater for the least well off than for the most well off. The Finance Bill should be the main instrument for doing something about that state of affairs. We have debated nothing so far that will help to achieve the Prime Minister's objective of reducing inequality. I hope that the Financial Secretary, or his ministerial colleagues, will put life into the Prime Minister's commitment.<br><br>
I notice that <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> said that the Prime Minister's comments, which were made off-the-cuff last Thursday, provide evidence of his socialist instinct. I am not sure about that.<br><br>
I believe that clause 59 will move us in the opposite direction from that to which the Prime Minister is committed. It will abolish the original, simple save-as-you-earn scheme, which entails regular monthly savings of up to £20 a month tax free, with bonuses paid after five and seven years. That system has been in place since it was introduced by a Labour Government in 1969. It is an inexpensive measure, which cost the Treasury £30 million in this tax year. The Treasury said that the SAYE scheme has been largely superseded by new schemes, and principally by TESSAs. That is not the case. Several Opposition Members have said that TESSAs and PEPs are used largely by better-off savers, so they cannot have superseded the SAYE scheme.<br><br>
The Treasury also said that the maximum contribution under the SAYE arrangements, and the implicit interest rates, are now largely obsolete. That is true, but they could easily have been put right by a modernising clause in the Bill. The <i>Financial Times</i> commented on the clause
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0669">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 291</span>
on 3 December, just after the Budget. It said that the clause had
<br><blockquote><p>"squeezed out small, regular savers."</p></blockquote>
The article went on to quote the Abbey National, which has 250,000 SAYE accounts, which said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It was one of the few accounts allowing the man in the street to take advantage of tax-free opportunities."</p></blockquote>
The SAYE arrangement is a simple, readily accessible measure that enables regular savings to be made over an indefinite period. It is available to small savers. Simplification is the only reason that the Treasury has given for its abolition. If simplification were the overriding goal of the Bill, many matters that we have discussed already would not have seen the light of day. Simplification is clearly not the Government's aim in the Bill, and it is a poor excuse for scrapping an important savings tool. I deplore the loss of the SAYE scheme, which has benefited enormous numbers of people. It could have benefited many more and its abolition does nothing to reduce inequality.<br><br>
In view of the time, I shall say nothing about the other provisions in clause 59, other than to regret both the complexity of the clause and the fact that, once again, tertiary legislation is being introduced in that the clause gives the Treasury the power to make regulations governing European institutions that offer save-as-you-earn share save schemes.<br><br>
I conclude where I began, given that I have no hope of our being able to vote the clause down, by asking how the Government can justify the meanness of the clause in abolishing a popular and accessible savings tool for small savers at a time when they have done nothing to curtail the payment of vast sums to themselves by wealthy people by means of executive share options, which were created by the counterpart of this legislation 11 years ago. The Government make no effort to stop the abuse of executive share options, yet they abolish a measure that enabled small savers to save regularly over long periods of time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to respond briefly to the question asked by the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Timms). I do not think that he has understood what the clause and schedule do. The ordinary SAYE account is being discontinued as a Department for National Savings product. The share save account, which has until now been a model Department for National Savings account product will continue, but will be offered by the private sector under a model scheme, the terms of which will be laid down by the Treasury.<br><br>
As for the hon. Gentleman's polemic on equality, I again assert that the Labour party is absolutely obsessed with relativities in this matter. What matters to most people is their absolute standard of living, their net take-home pay, their prospects and their real volume of personal wealth. The fact is that those indicators have risen for all sections of the population.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 292</span>
The measure does not increase inequality or widen gaps between people. The fact that the share save scheme will continue demonstrates that it has been popular and that the Government accord it priority. I put on record the fact that there have been 1,257 schemes approved up to 31 March 1994. Employees have been granted options over shares with an initial market value of approximately £10 billion. In 1992–93, 590,000 employees were granted options over shares worth nearly £1.9 billion. That is a considerable contribution towards enabling people on limited incomes and with limited resources to build up sufficient money to exercise share options in the firms for which they work.<br><br>
That is a considerable encouragement to employee share ownership which will continue. All that will change is that the scheme will no longer be offered by or operated as a Department for National Savings product. The reason for that is that the Department for National Savings, while encouraging the savings ethic, principally exists in order to raise money for the national debt and we must therefore examine carefully the cost and applicability of schemes, especially where there are others that are more relevant.<br><br>
The TESSA accounts have to a large extent superseded the small ordinary SAYE accounts, and, while they are not identical in all respects, there is no reason why people should be unable to take out a TESSA instead of an SAYE account. I point out the hon. Member for Newham, North-East that the relief on ordinary SAYE accounts currently costs the Treasury £3 million a year, not £30 million a year. Therefore, it is spurious to suggest that an enormous number of people take advantage of ordinary SAYE accounts. Of course, many more people currently save under, or will take out and save under, SAYE share save schemes, which will continue.<br><br>
The clause is a technical one which enables the Department for National Savings to withdraw from the market. In doing so, it will save taxpayers' money, which is advantageous. The clause also enables a wider range of institutions, including institutions in the European Union, to offer share save model schemes in the United Kingdom. For all those reasons, I assert that the provision will, improve people's opportunities to save preferentially and to take a share in their companies. It is highly desirable and does not deserve the criticism heaped on it this evening by the hon. Member for Newham, North-East. I hope that the Committee will agree to the clause.</span></p>
