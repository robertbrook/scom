	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 62, in page 9, line 21, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(c) a member state of the Council of Europe.".</p></q>
I have been a Member of Parliament for only eight or nine months. I read about the proposed new airport tax in the newspapers last year. The proposal filled my heart with horror. I spent a good chunk of my life working for international organisations and travelling around the world. I have visited many airports in different parts of the world—communist countries, and countries in the far east and in Latin America. One could tell that one was in a bankrupt, poorly run, inefficient, third-world, authoritarian, dictatorial state if one had to fork out for airport tax. One was back in civilisation in the United States, Europe, the Nordic countries or dynamic Asian countries, where airport taxes did not exist. I felt shame, as a British traveller—and as an executive card holder with British Airways—that the British Government proposed to impose a third-world tax on us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only in our country would such a pernicious, mean and reprehensible tax be allowed to crawl out of the Treasury. Tax on travel is the late 20th century equivalent of the 19th century tax on newspapers. I am sure that the Government will get around to taxing newspapers before their nine or 24 months are up. It is profoundly illiberal to tax travel at a time of globalisation. It is also inefficient. According to a note that I received from the Library, it will raise £90 million this year. That is less than the amount of money that could be raised if we abolished the £113 million that the Ministry of Defence uses to subsidise the private schools to which officers' sons—not their daughters—are sent. That is the sort of tax subsidy that no other modern country provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed tax is regressive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have allowed some discretion for two or three minutes, but the hon. Gentleman is going wide of the amendment. He is making a speech that would be more suitable in the clause stand part debate. However interesting his observations on the broader issues, I should be grateful if he confined his remarks to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My amendment relates to the £5 tax. It is important to distinguish between the two taxes that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
are proposed. The £10 tax if for all flights outside the United Kingdom, the European Union and two airports in Switzerland. The Swiss airports are, of course, included in the lower rate of tax because it is in Geneva and Basel that all the world's banks are situated. I have a list of them from the telephone book. I used to fly from Geneva frequently and hardly anybody uses the French side of those airports. None the less, to help British bankers, tax dodgers and the like, the Swiss airports have a lower £5 tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment would make the tax less regressive. The unamended clause hits poorer people much more than business travellers. It is profoundly anti-family. I have four children, and we have to pay an extra £60 when we fly to other European countries, which I am suggesting should be included in the Bill. The tax is anti-young people who want to escape the grey miseries of unemployment and low pay to countries such as Czechoslovakia and Turkey. My amendment would include those countries in the lower tax. The tax is anti-immigrant. Many Kashmiris in my constituency and in other constituencies have to pay the higher £10 rate of tax when they fly back to see their families on the subcontinent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Red Book, the Treasury states that capital gains tax is set to decrease, and that Whitehall forecasts a steady increase in revenue from that third-world tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman really intend to extend tax relief to Turkey, bearing in mind the Labour party's view of the Turkish regime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall refer to Turkey in a moment, if the hon. Gentleman is prepared to wait a couple of minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment makes sense of the tax, with its present absurd and illogical distinction between the European Union, the European Economic Area and other European countries. In clause 11(3)(9)—the clause's longest paragraph—there is a lengthy statement on Liechtenstein. Poor Liechtenstein. The last time that I met someone who was on his way to Liechtenstein was when I met the late and unlamented Robert Maxwell. I wish that I had saved pensioners a great deal of money and the Labour party a great deal of embarrassment if I had pushed him out the aeroplane door there and then, instead of waiting for him to jump off his boat. Liechtenstein, as we all know, is the tax haven of all tax havens, which is why Coopers and Lybrand is installed there, sorting out some of the taxpayers' money which was dished out by way of consultants' fees under the Tory version of clause IV. That version states "The mass privatisation of the means of production and distribution for the immediate profit of ex-Cabinet Ministers, where the work is by hand or, in some cases, by brain."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I checked whether the reference to Liechtenstein had any meaning by finding out this morning whether I could book a flight there. I telephoned British Airways and its reply was, "Never heard of it. What's the capital city?" I said, "Vaduz." British Airways replied, "Never heard of it, squire. Try Swiss Air." Swiss Air said that the only way to get to Liechtenstein is by flying to Zurich and then taking the bus and train—the Swiss still have a sensible public
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
transport system. I told them that I wanted to fly, and Swiss Air replied, "I'm sorry, Dr. MacShane, it must be a private aeroplane for you." The only way that one can reach Liechtenstein, it appears, is on a private, tax dodger's plane. Apparently, there are private airports all over the country, with Lear jets and other executive jets, doubtlessly named "Chief Secretary 1" or "Spirit of the Paymaster General", eager to hand over their £10 as long as they can get their tax consultant to Liechtenstein in time. The Liechtenstein clause is absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment would allow British people to travel anywhere in Europe at a common rate of airport tax. Some 30,000 to 40,000 holidaymakers from my constituency of Rotherham do not, alas, go to Liechtenstein. They earn £100, £200 or, at best, £300 a week, and to them that regressive airport tax is a family burden, although it is not one, perhaps, that Conservative Members have cause to worry about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The countries that would benefit from my proposal include Malta, a great jewel in British history, where there are more than 500,000 British visitors each year. Surely Malta deserves the same treatment as European Union countries. Cyprus, with which many of us have long and friendly links, has nearly 1 million British holidaymakers each year. Why is not it given the same treatment as European Union nations? Turkey, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman), receives 600,000 British holidaymakers each year, including some who go there to encourage democracy. I believe strongly that Turkey should have a close relationship with Europe. That matter has nothing to do with the debate, but it was raised by the hon. Gentleman. Travel contact can help to spread democracy and civil society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
East European countries, such as Poland, in which the working class took the lead in overthrowing communism 12 years ago, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, which are all wonderful and worthwhile countries to visit, are treated as second-class countries by the Government's proposal. They belong to the family of Europe, and hon. Members should seek to improve them. Although the Chief Secretary to the Treasury is not here, he will not mind my saying that it is bizarre for the leading Europhobe in the Cabinet to favour European Union countries—as it were, to privilege Brussels—over other European nations, and he should think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment proposes that countries within the Council of Europe should be covered by the same £5 tax as countries within the European Union and the airports of Geneva and Basle. I discussed that matter with several Conservative Members in the Tea Room, and they thought that my general principle was good and that it should be supported. I asked them whether one of their colleagues would be prepared to support my amendment in Committee, and they said, "Well, there are future Chancellors of the Exchequer, and there are one or two whose greatness lies behind them, but they still have much to contribute. They are the praetorian guard of the Tories, and you will not find one who is willing to break ranks." Conservative Members will therefore forgive me for not approaching them since we met on Tuesday. In the name of European people, family members, poor people, honest, ordinary British holidaymakers, not in the name of privileged bankers or privileged Brussels, I ask them to support me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I owe it to the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) to reply. He started by saying that only shady, bankrupt, third-world countries have such a duty. That will come as a surprise to citizens of the United States and of Denmark. I do not know what the hon. Gentleman has against Denmark, but it has such a tax, and so do France and Belgium. I hope that the hon. Gentleman did not articulate Labour policy in categorising those countries as dictatorial, bankrupt and shady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Referring to the substance of the amendment, I should explain that the £5 rate for air passenger duty was applied to the European Union and subsequently extended to the European Economic Area; that is an easily identifiable group of European countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to make it plain to those who administer the duty, especially passenger ticket agencies which may be in any part of the world, where the £10 to £5 boundary lies. The difficulty with extending it to the Council of Europe is that, although the hon. Gentleman is clearly a great expert on its membership, it is not commonly known outside Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, who, even among members of the Committee, knows that Slovakia and Slovenia are members of the Council of Europe, and that Albania, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia are not? Therefore, the distinction that the hon. Gentleman is trying to draw is confusing, particularly as many such countries are not full members—they hold special guest status. That creates further ambiguity and difficulties in administering the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Airlines and ticket agencies would have to anticipate the outcome of current discussions, for example about whether Russia should join. There may be different views in the Committee about that matter and about whether Russia's democratic credentials are sufficiently good. To expect passengers and airlines, which may sell tickets many months in advance, to anticipate membership puts an unfair burden on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should add that the concession that the hon. Gentleman wants would cost £22 million a year, the Committee will agree that, whatever the good motives behind the amendment, I cannot advise hon. Members to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Liddell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely confused by the issues that have emerged as a result of the implementation of air passenger duty. The amendment would, to some extent, ease some of the difficulties that have been created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like most Members of Parliament with Scottish constituencies, I spend considerable time in airports and aeroplanes. We in Scotland put tremendous emphasis on infrastructure, and airports and airlines are critical to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the irregularities are bizarre and incomprehensible. The application of the tax is extremely inequitable and arbitrary. Is the Minister aware that, if a round-trip between London and Glasgow is made on a three-day return ticket, the tax is £5, but, if the journey is made on a return ticket that is valid for more than three days, the tax is £10?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0529">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
The irregularities that my hon. Friend mentioned beggar belief. Can the Minister explain the difference in taxation on the same journey within the United Kingdom? It seems peculiar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also worried about the impact of the tax. I understand that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady, to an extent, is making the same mistake as the hon. Member for Rotherham made. She is making a clause stand part debate observation; it is not related to the amendment, to which, I hope, she will direct her remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment relates to extending the concession to
	<br><q><p>"a member state of the Council of Europe."</p></q>
It is not relevant to the complications of the tax, as she sees them, as it is being implemented. I hope that the hon. Lady will discuss the amendment. She may make a speech in the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Winterton. I am operating in the Committee with L-plates on. Thank you for your advice; I shall try to catch your eye later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warwickshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham pointed out, it is important to encourage travel, particularly in eastern Europe. Any taxes that we impose which thus act as a deterrent to that contact should be discouraged. Whenever the Government make decisions about imposing such levies on travellers they should consider not just the income benefits to the Exchequer but the damage in terms of reduced contact that they might bring about. My hon. Friend raised a number of important points which suggest that the damage would outweigh the benefits to the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster General suggested that the costs of the concession would be £22 million. I wonder about the costs of collecting the levy. The administration involved in collecting the tax and the burden that it places on the airports and companies could be considerable. What would be the actual cost of the concession? If my hon. Friend's amendment were accepted, would not the airports and companies involved be grateful that they would no longer need to make calculations and would be spared the costs of collection?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Waterson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is the world of difference, in terms of administration and collection costs, between the airport tax that the hon. Member for Rotherham described, where one fumbles in one's pocket to pay someone at the airport and the situation here? As long as the rate remains fairly modest—I shall have more to say about that matter later—it has so far at least been subsumed into the ticket price, particularly by the major airlines flying from this country. Of the options, that is by far and away the cheapest way of collecting the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Keeping a tax simple and easy to collect is obviously a good thing, but imposing a tax, however simple and easy it is to collect, has costs. We have been given a figure of £22 million for the concession. I seek a realistic assessment of the costs of the concession and the possible benefits to airports and airlines if they are no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
longer involved in the process. I am not quite sure, as is clear from the way in which I am putting my remarks, how the fax is collected. It might be useful if the Paymaster General set out how the tax is collected and in what circumstances. In my limited travels I have had little experience of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the costs for the various bodies that collect it for the Government and what will it cost the Government to process the claims? We can then perhaps look at the overall costs in real terms of the concession, which I suspect may be much less than the £22 million which the Government suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us back to my first point. If we are to have those taxes, we must consider not only the potential benefits but the damage that they may cause by deterring international travel and contact and links with countries, particularly in eastern Europe, that are emerging from communism and are trying to rebuild democracy. Those links are important and we should not discourage them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was right to mention that the amendment is perhaps defective because Albania, Croatia and Bosnia, for example, are not part of the Council of Europe and some countries have special guest status. In due course, it might well be necessary to examine further the operation of the measure. I should like an extension to cover countries such as Albania, Croatia and Bosnia. However, the defect does not invalidate the amendment, which constitutes a forceful attempt by my hon. Friend to encourage contact with countries in the Council of Europe and to ensure a much simpler way of collecting the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham—just. He almost dissuaded me with his comments about Robert Maxwell, made in support of his views, but leaving those on one side it is worth considering the amendment. At least it raises the question whether the Government adopted the right approach in the first place—whether the application of a £5 or £10 rate should be decided with reference to a union, an area of economic activity, or a council that countries can choose to join or not as they please or as from time to time permitted by the existing members. A matter has arisen that should be considered and the Paymaster General did not tackle it when he responded to my hon. Friend's suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster General's only argument seemed to be that people knew better which countries were in the European Union than they knew which countries were in the European Economic Area. I suggest that the tax would apply to two groups of people. The first is people going on holiday once a year, choosing their destinations according to what appeals from the travel brochure. I am not sure, on recollecting the travel brochures that I have read over the years, that reference is usually made to countries' membership of the European Union, European Economic Area or Council of Europe. Most of my constituents who read travel brochures may not even be aware of the airport tax, let alone the grouping of the country they want to go to. I doubt whether an ordinary person in the street outside the House of Commons today would be able to enumerate the countries of the European Economic Area—unless one were to ask a Member of Parliament, and most of them probably would not know. I cannot conclude that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0530">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
Paymaster General's view is a strong argument for rejecting my hon. Friend's amendment. It is not an argument at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second group of people who might take flights to the countries concerned would be business people. Some might have reason to know to which grouping, union, area of economic activity or council their destination countries belonged. However, there is a second argument, which my hon. Friend the Member for Warwickshire, North (Mr. O'Brien) made about business—that among the countries that are outside the EEA and the European Union there are some with which we are presumably trying to encourage business. It is a disappointment to me that some of the opportunities that are now materialising in eastern Europe seem to be taken up more readily by businesses from Germany and other nations than by ours. The Government should encourage our business people to take up opportunities with countries outside the EEA and outside the European Union. Perhaps, in accordance with the desires that have been expressed on both sides of the House, some of those countries will eventually join the European Union or the EEA. Currently, they have not done so, but we should not exclude them from our business arrangements. We should encourage the development of such arrangements with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am

I strongly argue that those countries in Europe—those outside the EEA; the ones with which we should try to develop new business arrangements and where perhaps most new opportunities are available—are ones which we should not discourage business men from visiting by ensuring that the highest airport tax applies to those countries. Such an approach is a little odd and the wrong way around. I could find no justification in what the Minister said, apart from the £22 million, for making such a change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the Minister is worried about the amount of revenue obtained from the tax, why is he making the change from the European Union to the EEA? If the problem is loss of revenue by moving towards the Council of Europe countries as those to which the £5 rate applies, how can he justify moving to the EEA? Presumably that would involve a loss in revenue, although the Minister did not say what that would be. How can he, as a matter of principle, be worried about loss of revenue when he supports a provision—which we shall reach in a further debate—that would reduce revenue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment raises a number of principles that are worthy of consideration and response from the Minister. Consistency in these matters is desirable. Changes from year to year confuse people. One problem of taxation in this country is that it changes so often. There are many examples, and this is one, of a tax being introduced by a Government in one year and, within 12 months, they propose changing it. That is not generally helpful. Plainly, if a Government get something wrong, as they often do, changes must be introduced. But we should try to achieve stability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having more countries within the remit of the £5 rate, rather than such countries coming into the European Union and the EEA in future, with resulting changes in the arrangements, is an advantage. It is a good principle of taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
Following the comments of my hon. Friend the Minister for Warwickshire, North, the amendment could even perhaps have gone further. We could have considered the whole of Europe as a geographical entity, as that is unlikely to change. In some respects, such an amendment might have been better, because the principle of consistency would be harder to breach in future. We do not have such an amendment, but the point is at least worth making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, a principle that the amount of revenue coming to the Exchequer would not fluctuate with changing international arrangements between countries would also have merit. In future, other countries may join the European Union or the EEA. The Minister said that the amendment would result in a loss of revenue to the Exchequer. But a change in international arrangements would also lose money to the Exchequer because countries would change—from £10 to £5—the airport tax that is charged when flying from this country to them by the very fact that they joined the European Union or the EEA. Presumably that would happen. The effect of the clause and, indeed, the amendment, would be to set the rate according to countries that have a particular international relationship with this country; it would be done not by name but by relationship. If such relationships change in future, the rate of tax will change. I am not sure that that is especially desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a matter of principle, taxation should be clear. I return to my earlier point which the Minister did not really answer. People must be clear about the countries to which a particular rate of tax applies. That is perhaps a slight criticism of the amendment, but it is equally a criticism of the Minister's argument. If there are descriptions of particular international blocs—whether trading blocs, or political or economic unions—and the public do not know to which countries they refer and the countries in those blocs change over a period, the taxation will not be especially clear. There will be more amendments in future because of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An amendment that referred to Europe simply as a geographical entity would have better applied to this piece of taxation the principle of clarity which should be applied to all taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I think that the amendment is worthy of support, particularly because it would help to encourage business with countries with which we should be encouraging business. I should like the Minister to respond to that point in particular. His argument about £22 million is not significant, as he ought to admit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with hon. Members who have argued for consistency, wherever possible, in taxation policy and that is why I criticise the amendment. It cannot be consistent or logical to propose halving the airport duty for people travelling to Slovenia or Turkey, but not for those travelling to Bosnia or Latvia. That has no logic for the passengers or the airlines, especially as the membership of the Council of Europe is undergoing frequent change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's arguments are interesting, but he should note that clause 9 refers to Liechtenstein in a provisional manner. Until the EEA agreement comes into force in relation to Liechtenstein, the lower rate of duty does not cover that country. The

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
Minister has, therefore, already conceded that categories change with time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) referred to Europe as a geographical entity. I am not sure in which categories Cyprus or Malta would be placed, or whether Cyprus is part of Europe or the middle east. The Council of Europe changes, the EEA changes and I hope that the European Union will soon change. It is better to have institutions that can decide to which countries the lower rate should be applied, as the Paymaster General does on a provisional basis in relation to the much mentioned Liechtenstein.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why I made a point about the Council of Europe, which is undergoing radical change and in which there are nine guest countries, including Russia, which have special guest status with the Council of Europe with prospective full membership. The amendment would introduce an enormous uncertainty into the tax because airlines selling tickets with £10 rate to passengers travelling to Russia would not know whether, when the journeys were made, they should qualify at a £5 rate. The same problem exists with any organisation that is undergoing changes in membership, but those problems are far fewer and less frequent in the cases of the European Union and the European Economic Area. Liechtenstein is an example of such a problem, but I put the problem of Liechtenstein, if it can be so described, against the nine countries that may become full members of the Council of Europe. The amendment is poor on grounds of consistency and predictability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I add that extending the £5 concession to the EEA, as the substance of the clause proposes, helps administration of the duty in another way. When four EEA members were negotiating to join the European Union last year, we extended the £5 concession to the EEA and that gave airlines the certainty that all those countries would qualify for the £5 rate, regardless of whether they actually joined the European Union. In the event, as we know, three of those countries—Finland, Sweden and Austria—joined. Norway did not join, but that did not affect the administration of the duty because each country was previously—and Norway remains—a member of the EEA and therefore qualified for the £5 duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a certain logic and consistency in the arrangements as they now are and as they are proposed in the clause. I invite the Committee to reject the proposal to open up the arrangements to the Council of Europe with its changing membership and with the uncertainties and inconsistencies of the tax between members and non-members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of collection, was also mentioned. I assure the Committee that Customs and Excise has worked hard and successfully with the airlines to help them comply with the tax. Indeed, some airlines are using special accounting schemes, which make calculating the liability simpler, by use of their own administrative systems. No major problems have been revealed since the tax came into force last November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) that amendment would do absolutely nothing to reduce compliance costs. Therefore, the amendment's cost of £22 million in a full year would be a straight loss to the Exchequer, and would do nothing significant to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
help the airlines. For all those reasons, I must persist in inviting the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly. We have already had some useful and interesting discussions on the technical aspects of collecting this tax, despite some of the more eccentric excursions on which the hon. Member for Rotherham took us. I should like to say a word about the principle behind the tax before asking my hon. Friend the Paymaster General to give me an idea of the Government's future intentions regarding air passenger duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it fair to say that when the tax was first announced, it caused some dismay in the airline industry. I am an officer of the Conservative Back-Bench tourism committee, and my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Hawkins) is a key member. We had a number of representations about the tax, which we passed on to Treasury Ministers at the time. British Airways, rightly renowned as the world's favourite airline, had more than most to say about the proposals. It is fair to say that the Treasury, in introducing two-tier rates of duty, has taken some account of the representations made at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be proud of our airline industry, especially British Airways—a company which, to use Lord King's words, went from "awful" to "awesome" in about a decade. It underlines the benefits of privatising the commanding heights of the British economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was disagreement in the previous debate about whether this is an airport tax. It is a loose use of language to call it an airport tax. It is most certainly not the sort of tax that we have to pay when returning from holidays in far-flung places—not necessarily in the third world, as we have heard. That is a case of fumbling for local currency—of course, some countries accept any currency but their own—or of retaining the exact amount of currency to pay the man before we can board our aircraft. This tax is not the same. It is, as the name implies, an air passenger duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0532">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
Despite their original reservations, there has been a large element of co-operation among the airlines in collecting the duty—something which my hon. Friend the Paymaster General recognised in his remarks at the end of the previous debate. At present, the airlines are, in effect, the tax collectors, making for a very efficient method of collection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real issue here is future intentions. All new taxes are introduced with the best intentions. Back in 1799, when income tax was introduced for the first time at a rate of two shillings in the pound on incomes of more than £200—quite a lot of money in those days—Prime Minister Pitt introduced it as a temporary expedient, which would not be continued after Napoleon had been defeated. In the short term, at least, that pledge was honoured. Income tax was discontinued after the peace of Amiens, in about 1804. It was unfortunately reintroduced, but dropped again in 1815 after the final defeat of Bonaparte. Unfortunately, it was reintroduced in 1842 by Prime Minister Peel at the punitive rate of seven old pence in the pound, and it has been with us ever since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is this: taxes are always introduced with the best intentions. There is a seductiveness about the ease of collection of the air passenger duty which is perhaps a little worrying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Hoon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ashfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has referred to criticisms made by British Airways this time last year about the introduction of this tax. British Airways was concerned that it would become the biggest unpaid tax collector in the United Kingdom. Does the hon. Gentleman agree with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a rather alarmist remark, as things have turned out. As I understand it—and I am happy to be corrected on this—British Airways is subsuming these rates of duty into its ticket prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention, as it brings me to my next point. It is crucial for this tax that the rates remain fairly modest. The hon. Member for Attercliffe suggested that business men might decide not to go on a business trip because of having to pay £10 or £5 as part of the ticket. That is far fetched. Business class tickets already cost hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds. The hon. Gentleman's constituents have not noticed the taxes because they are effectively collected by the unpaid tax collectors of companies such as British Airways. No company will emphasise such a tax in its brochure. I suspect that 90 per cent. of the travelling public are blissfully unaware of the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have always understood the Conservative party's prevailing philosophy on taxation to be that taxes should be as low as possible and that taxation systems should be as transparent as possible. Why is the hon. Gentleman happy for the tax to be hidden in the ticket price? Surely it would be more consistent with the Conservative party's approach to ensure that every consumer knew precisely how much tax was paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that point. However, I made a different point. As long as the duty remains modest, it will be collected in the way that we have outlined. Many ticket prices will remain the same. Therefore, there is little for the traveller to worry about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I share common ground with the hon. Member for Ashfield; if the duty rose significantly in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
future, a problem might arise. Airlines that had hitherto collected the tax with reasonably good grace might make more of an issue of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised by the hon Gentleman's point. Recent British Airways estimates suggest that it costs the airline £11 million to collect the tax. That is a tremendous on-cost to a company. I speak with feeling, because like most Scottish Members of Parliament, much of my life and well-being depends of the efficiency of British Airways. It is bizarre that the cost of collection is so considerable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always pleased to hear a ringing endorsement of British Airways from the party that would not have allowed the company's privatisation and may have plans to renationalise it. Perhaps we shall find that out nearer the general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not aware of the figure of £11 million that the hon. Lady mentioned. I should be interested to see a breakdown of it. The figure is surprising. The Paymaster General has described the way in which airlines have buckled down and dealt with collection through their computerised accounting systems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I can sympathise with the burdens of British Airways in trying to collect airport duty, does not my hon. Friend agree that the burden is no different from that of business men who have to claim VAT?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not sure that we wish to get into a VAT debate. I shall permit the hon. Gentleman to respond briefly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Lady Olga Maitland) is right to the extent that one of the attractions—if that is the right word—to the Treasury of VAT when it was introduced 20 years ago and I was a research assistant here, was the ease and cheapness of its collection. The collection of VAT, like that of airport tax, is carried out by businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to collect the threads of my argument after so many helpful interventions. From the Treasury's point of view, duty is convenient and cost effective to collect. There is a tremendous temptation for any future Chancellor—especially a Labour Chancellor—to try to bump up the duty sharply as a painless way of collecting more revenue. That is the basis of the real concern of the travel industry and those of us who spend time dealing with its concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my hon. Friend cannot seek to bind my right honourable and learned Friend the Chancellor, or future Chancellors, but this is a real worry. Could future increases in air passenger duty be limited to inflation increases? What is now £5 or £10 could, if it were £50 to £100, make much more difference and create more distortion in an important part of our economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to follow the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) because I was interested in several points he made. I was concerned at his suggestion that business would not pay much attention to an increase in ticket charges of £5 to £10 because business men would instinctively travel in business class. Having recently left
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
business life, I wish that my chief executive had allowed me to travel willy-nilly in business class. The increased cost to the company would be considerable. Representing an area that contains several multinational corporations, I am concerned about the on-cost for companies whose staff, necessarily, travel a great deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that this should not be seen as an airport tax. I am concerned about the genesis of the reasoning behind the tax. Why should one pay this tax if one has to fly when, with the channel tunnel and ferry links, there is no similar tax? It seems strange that the Chancellor has decided to impose that tax exclusively on air travel. Why not on other means of travel?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my earlier, mistimed intervention I raised my concern about the inequitable and arbitrary manner in which the tax is being applied. I repeat the point: why, on a round-trip between London and Glasgow, is the tax £5 for a journey on a three-day return ticket, but £10 on a return ticket made valid for more than three days? Several airline companies, such as British Midland, are selling business men and women—increasingly business women, as hon. Gentlemen and airlines should occasionally remember—books of tickets. For example, it is possible to buy a book for return business trips from Glasgow to London from British Midland for £699. I am sure that Conservative Members would be anxious to see competition advanced as much as possible, but, if travel companies use that means to lure people on to airlines, where does the tax apply within the arrangement? Does it apply to each ticket, or to the book that was available on a discounted basis?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that it is possible that passengers from New York to London and then to Newcastle or Glasgow will be exempt while those who make the journey the other way round are not. That seems a bizarre application of a piece of taxation. I am not terribly efficient at working out my travel costs, as I find every month when I try to work out my expenses. I seem to be a disaster area when I try to work out the family holiday arrangements, but I do not think that I am alone in that. This tax complicates the decisions people must make to travel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first tranche of the tax, in force from 22 December, has now been collected. Can the Paymaster General tell me how much was collected? I am concerned about the efficiency of the tax. There is no point in levying an inefficient tax. As I told the hon. Member for Eastbourne, the £11 million collection charge to British Airways alone seems unfair to the airline. Those of us who have to use British Airways and British Midland services are always very conscious of our dependency on the goodwill of the staff of those airlines, particularly when we are rushing back home late on a Thursday night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems strange that these airlines carry such a heavy cost. Would it not be possible for the cost of collection to be set against the duty payable or for a more simple means of collection to be implemented if the Government are hell-bent on retaining this tax? It is strange to have a tax imposed on air travel. Later today, a number of shop stewards from a neighbouring constituency to mine who are at the cutting edge of technology in the manufacture of aero-engines are coming here to voice their concerns
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
about the competition in the airline industry, the purchasing of aircraft, the effect of demand on their jobs and the threat of redundancy that hangs over them. It is strange to impose taxes that can affect a whole industry and to do so in such a willy-nilly and ill-thought-out way. The Government seek to introduce this clause to make modifications. They must have analysed the impact of air passenger duty, or they would not seek to introduce the clause. Why did they not go back to first principles and argue through the basis of the tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to echo a number of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne. As active members of both the Back Bench and all-party tourism committees, we are aware of the concerns about this issue. Two particular points have emerged from the debate. Those who follow our proceedings in this Committee carefully outside the House cannot have failed to notice two clear signs from Opposition Members. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne talked about the danger that there would be if this country were ever misguided enough to elect a Labour Government and how it would be all too easy for the party of high taxation opposite to introduce a swingeing rise. My hon. Friend's apt comment provoked nothing but cheers from Opposition Members. Yet again, they come out in their true colours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) asked why other modes of transport should not be taxed. There we have it loud and clear. On the question of future taxes from any future Labour Government in any future Labour manifesto Opposition Members have once again given themselves away to those members of the public who are concerned about taxation. I share the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I mistaken about whether this tax is being introduced by the Government? Conservative Members have talked about hidden taxes and ticket taxes as opposed to airport duty. The point is about future increases. Surely before deciding whether to have this tax there should have been consultation with the industry. There has been no consultation. The tax was announced and then the consultation took place. The industry had to respond. It is no good attacking the Labour party on taxes when the Government are introducing a tax in this manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

The Conservative party has always believed in keeping taxation to a minimum and is concerned that the Labour party would wish to use any opportunity to increase taxes. My Friend the Member for Eastbourne and I both represent leading tourists resorts and are concerned about the tourist industry generally; we want my hon. Friend the Paymaster General to assure us that the Government do not intend to use the tax as the thin end of the wedge. We know that the Labour party would undoubtedly take any opportunity to increase taxation to pay for its ludicrous spending plans. I ask for assurances from my hon.

Members for Blackpool, South and for Eastbourne, not least because of their strictures to Ministers about how careful they must be to avoid increasing the rate of the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether either hon. Member would tell the Committee what undertakings they gave to their potential constituents at the previous election in their election addresses about how a vote for them would be a vote for lower taxes. Did they mention their support for introducing the tax, which was never mentioned by the Conservative party in its manifestos?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This time last year, our main criticism of the tax was the haste with which it had been put together; we also criticised the ill-conceived and ill-thought-out provision's in last year's Finance Bill, and the haste with which the Government were again forced to introduce amendments to make sense of their proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very happy to tell the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is about neither, Mr. Winterton. I must tell the hon. Member for Ashfield, who has been kind enough to allow me to intervene again, that it is undoubtedly the case that any plans that the Labour party puts forward will be for much greater taxation than under a Conservative Government. That has been the case in every general election and will be the case, I suspect, in every future one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is tempting me to stray out of order, Mr. Winterton. I shall endeavour to resist, but I apologise in advance if, at some stage, the temptation proves irresistible.

The answer to the hon. Gentleman's observation is that he faces a problem when comparing the attitude of the two main political parties towards taxation: the electorate are convinced that the Conservative party's undertakings cannot be relied on. Equally, any recent opinion poll will demonstrate overwhelmingly that the electorate are prepared to have some confidence in promises and undertakings given by the Labour party rather than those of the Government.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The real reason for introducing the tax so hastily and including in last year's Bill such poorly considered proposals, which made it necessary for hasty Government amendments to be drafted, was the Government's desperate effort to plug the gap in finances that their economic mismanagement had caused.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Representing as I do another seaside resort, I suggest that representations made to my hon. Friends the Members for Eastbourne and for Blackpool, South may have been similar to those made to me.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman because he has led me directly to my next point. I was going to remark on the coincidence between the fact that we had already heard two Conservative Members, representing seaside constituencies—now joined, I am pleased to say, by a third—who were bemoaning in one sense the need to introduce the tax, but, of course, the tax may well be of direct benefit to their constituents. Notwithstanding the strictures from the hon. Member for Eastbourne that the tax should not rise too high under a Conservative Government, he may use his best endeavours to persuade the Paymaster General and his colleagues to raise the level of taxation still higher, as a means of persuading people to take their holidays in Eastbourne, Blackpool or Bournemouth. As far as I am aware, it is not yet possible to take a plane between any part of the United Kingdom and Blackpool. Even it is possible, one would not have to pay the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point of my criticism is that, this time last year, Opposition Members spent a lot of time trying to persuade the Government to accept amendments that would have made airport duty far more sensible and practical in its operation. We have already heard of British Airways' reservations and its criticisms of the operation of the tax in practice. We suggested that the tax was ill-thought-out and ill-conceived. Indeed, one of the great ironies of this stand part debate is that a criticism made by Opposition Members last year was that the Government had failed to recognise the way in which the European Union would develop. We said that we needed to treat the European Economic Area on a similar basis to the way in which the Government last year proposed to treat the European Union. Twelve months on—I am sorry to say that it appears to take the Government 12 months to notice the sensible amendments that Opposition Members propose—we are faced with an amendment to the airport duty that has precisely that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We made other criticisms and I shall not strain your patience, Mr. Winterton, by going through each one in detail, although I know that some of my hon. Friends would like me to do so. Nevertheless, we had criticisms of the rather complex proposals on the weight and size of aircrafts. They are not addressed in the clause, although the Government had the opportunity to introduce more sensible arrangements. We were extremely anxious about the highland and islands. There was great concern from

both sides of the Committee about the way in which the provisions affect communities in that remote part of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a detailed debate this time last year about the distinction between stopovers and transfers and the rather complex provisions that the Government tabled, which, sadly, even the Paymaster General's predecessor could not explain satisfactorily to the Committee. He said that the Government would be bringing forward an order to explain the meaning of the distinction between stopovers and transfers. I have not had the opportunity to visit the Library to check whether such an order is available, but I have not seen the terms of one. If the present Paymaster General would be so kind, he might indicate to us when the order was laid before Parliament and its terms, because we are dealing with an amendment which members of the Committee were anxious about this time last year. I should be grateful if the present Paymaster General could tell us whether a similar order, along the lines canvassed by his predecessor, has at any stage been laid before Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the clause and the fact that it will bring consistency to air passenger duty. I also regard it as a generous concession and I hope that it will be appreciated by many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rotherham tried to suggest that such a duty was pernicious and would cause great hardship to travellers, but that is not borne out by the numbers of people travelling by air, which are increasing month on month and year on year.

There is no evidence that such a duty is deterring people from travelling: the effect is quite the opposite. To suggest that business men could be deterred by the imposition of a modest duty is nonsense. On those grounds alone, we should continue with our endeavours in that direction. As far as student travel is concerned, every year more students are taking to the air than ever before: they are not deterred by the duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that the hon. Member for Monklands, East hinted at a possible spending pledge by her party to take the bit, run with it and impose a higher duty in future. That strikes me as typical of the Labour party and I hope that the wider public wil take serious note.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was attracted to some elements of the speech by the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) who is not in his place at the moment, in which he asked for assurance from the Paymaster General that the tax would not rise. I hope that such an assurance will be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Blackpool, South was animadverting on the subject of the Labour party and tax

rises. Coming from the representative of a party that has imposed more regressive taxes—indeed, raised more new taxes—than any other country in the OECD in the past seven years, that was like listening to a lecture from Eric Cantona on gentlemanly behaviour when leaving the football pitch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to address my remarks to my hon. Friends on the Opposition Front Bench, given that in a year, or a shorter period, it may be their responsibility to examine the nature of the tax. I address my remarks to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman will address his remarks to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many L-plates among Opposition Members. I am grateful for that guidance, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said that the tax was no hardship. Of course it is not a hardship for her and may not be a hardship for any of us in this room. However, to find an extra £40 or £60 or, for a larger family, an even larger sum, is a considerable problem for many of my constituents who, if they are lucky enough to be in paid employment, are living at the edge of Micawberism. The tax is the sixpence, as it were, that puts them over the limit of sound and happy budgeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to address the regressive nature of the tax. If we are to have an air passenger duty, at least let it be constructed so that the broadest shoulders carry the burden. On more than one occasion, when travelling through London airports in the 1980s, clutching my economy class ticket, I saw the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, then a humble banker and Back-Bench Member of Parliament, dashing for Concorde, no doubt to make a great deal of money recycling Arab wealth into American and third world ventures. I was travelling so that I could try to defend the interests of working people who were the victims of those ill-gotten and ill-judged ventures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that it would be absurd for a humble, poorly paid trade unionist, clutching his bucket-shop, economy class ticket, to pay the same airport duty tax as the Chief Secretary will when, quite soon, he returns to the pleasures of banking and starts taking Concorde regularly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether Ministers fly Concorde, but a fairer way to construct the tax would be on the basis of ticketing so that there was a rate for Concorde passengers and other rates for first-class, for business class, for economy tickets and down to the students and holiday charter passengers who would pay the lowest rate. That is a simple way to collect the tax. There would be absolutely no problem collecting a percentage or rate on a type of ticket rather than the mish-mash of £5 or £10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Switzerland came into the EU, Zurich would drop to £5. If Norway changes its mind or the Visegrad countries join the EU they will drop to £5. I should be happy to see the tax abolished, but if we are to have it the Paymaster General or, in due course, the Labour Front Bench could consider a fair airport duty tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most absurdly unfair aspect of this regressive tax is that executive jets are excluded. That includes jets under 10 tonnes in weight when carrying fewer than 20 people. I can understand the reasoning when it comes to the leisure industry's trips around the bay and so on. But most
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0536">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
of those jets, certainly for overseas travel, are used by the richest of the rich who get off scot free. Is not that, in a nutshell or in microcosm, the essence of Tory taxation? From those that have not shall be taken as much as possible; from those that have far more than they know how to spend all taxes shall be lifted. I see that the Paymaster General is receiving a quick note. I ask him to consider whether by the time of the next Finance Bill the tax could be adjusted to be on the basis of ticket category, aimed clearly at those who can most afford to pay and lifting it off my constituents to whom, with respect to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, it is an additional, unfair new tax burden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly to respond to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam whose mischievous suggestion was that Labour was making spending commitments here. My point is the downright inefficiency and ill-thought-out nature of the tax. Why introduce a tax on only one means of transport? The Government are running out of steam, clutching at straws and not thinking properly in advance about the consequences of their taxation. It is an inefficient, regressive and nonsensical tax. The Government, in introducing the clause, recognise that they acted without sufficient thought for the detail of what is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady made a more general point about the possibility of a future Labour Government. One reason why we—particularly new Members—are taking such an interest in the detail of the Bill is that we are conscious that, within a short time, we could be occupying the Government Benches and we are therefore putting considerable emphasis on learning as quickly as possible the procedures, to ensure that we do not introduce daft taxation that is inefficient and operates against only one part of the transport industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a brief contribution about several matters that have not so far been raised. One that concerns me, and on which I should like the Paymaster General to comment, relates to the discussion on how easy it is to collect the tax, because the airline companies have collected it. There has also been discussion about how they have co-operated. Of course they have cooperated—they have had no option but to co-operate. It is absurd to argue that they have done so with enthusiasm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we introduce new taxes they should be easy to collect—but not simply because the burden is passed to other tax collectors. Taxes that are introduced should also be easy to police, so that people do not attempt evasion. Will the Paymaster General tell us what experience is available relating to the policing of the tax? I did not take part in last year's debate on the introduction of the tax, but if the burden of collection lies with the airline, I am interested to know what system we have for policing airlines—not British Airways in particular, but the other airlines that will be taking people from the UK. I am
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
especially concerned about the troublesome concession that I take to have been made, by which on a journey within the UK the tax is paid only once. Difficulties arise for the airlines in identifying the passengers who have travelled on one day or within two days, and who are therefore liable to pay the tax only once. I cannot understand how the Government, the Treasury or the airlines can implement that tax equitably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Eastbourne and for Blackpool, South have requested undertakings as to the amount of the tax. I tend to agree that the level set is probably not too burdensome for business travellers, although I want to comment later with regard to other travellers. Whatever reassurance the Paymaster General gives today about a commitment not to raise the tax beyond the level of inflation, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne has requested, nobody will believe it. Previous commitments in respect of the entire range of taxation have not been upheld.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand how Conservative Members, who have a particular interest in the airline industry, can still put up their hands in support of taxation on the strength of such undertakings as we will no doubt be given but which the only record available to us suggests are not certain to be upheld. I guess that in future, in attempts to reduce direct taxation, which will be perceived as a popular course of action in the run-up to a general election, there will be every temptation for Conservative Ministers to raise the tax as a form of hidden taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Paymaster General has been attempting a consistent approach to the introduction and implementation of the tax I fail to undertstand why the £5 rate is payable on travelling from the UK to Basle and Geneva airports, although Switzerland is not in any of the given categories, while elsewhere the £10 rate must be paid. Could that be something to do with helping Conservative Members to gain access to their Swiss bankers, or is there another logic that I have failed to uncover? </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Perhaps I may comment on one issue, which seemed totally absurd. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam suggested that students frequently travel by air and have no difficulty in meeting the additional air travel tax introduced by the Government last year. I do not know how many students the hon. Lady knows. Two of my children are currently in higher education, and from my experience of them and their friends and extensive knowledge of and interest in the issue of student finances and students' ability to pay, I can say that the last thing that students can do—given the current grant and loan scheme forced upon them by the Government—is to afford any air travel whatever. Only the children of Conservative Members, who tend to supplement their income through means other than simply their parliamentary salaries, have greater facilities than most other students.

If possible, I should like the Paymaster General to respond, especially on the issue of policing. I am unclear about the mechanisms to ensure that the tax is fairly implemented in the case of those who travel from United Kingdom airports to other destinations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sutcliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has concentrated on many issues.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax was hastily introduced. It was not thought out; the airline industry was not consulted. The industry has done its best to collect the tax. It was worried about the unfairness of tax provisions in transport policies, and how they affected the industry in comparison with its competitors. Some members of the Committee claimed that £5 or £10 is not a large amount of money and would not affect the industry. But some commentators say that adding £5 to the price of a ticket on a flight to Northern Ireland might tip the balance in favour of competing airlines. We are not discussing an airport tax, but a ticket

I said, in passing, that criticisms of rates come ill from the Opposition, who refuse to give pledges. Perhaps they have good reason for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government regard all taxation as an imposition on the citizen; the Opposition have an itch to tax. The Opposition may repent their past errors, but their record speaks for itself. Someone once said, "Do not read the crystal ball when you can read the book". History teaches much about the Labour party's attitude towards public expenditure and taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a duty to keep compliance costs down and to minimise the administrative expenditure that is part of taxation. From the beginning, Customs and Excise worked closely with the airlines and adapted, as far as possible, the mechanisms for raising the tax to suit the airlines' computer booking and administrative systems. The start date for the duty was postponed for a month to coincide with the beginning of the airlines' winter schedules, so that prices would not have to be adjusted and airlines would not have to absorb the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have listened to representations from the industry about the detailed workings of the tax. I am happy to tell the Committee that although the tax was introduced only last November, 99 per cent. of the expected revenue yield for that month was received on time in December. To have been so near our target with a new tax is a credit to Customs and Excise and to the airlines it worked with.

The hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) asked about return flights. I think that she is mistaken in this respect. It is not true that a return flight is taxed in the United Kingdom at £10. The length of time is irrelevant. The hon. Lady referred subsequently to books of tickets, which certain airlines issue. I confirm that when

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
passengers use timesaver-type tickets, airlines such as British Airways and British Midland can use the special accounting scheme available to them which allows passengers to benefit from the exemption for a return leg. That effectively means that the airlines charge £2.50 for each journey undertaken by the passenger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I require further clarification from the Minister. On Monday, his colleague in another place, in replying to a similar point from a Labour Member, said something to the effect that the noble Lords may have found it amusing, but that there comes a point when a return journey ceases to be a return journey and becomes two separate legs of two different journeys. That appears to contradict the Paymaster General's point regarding three-day return tickets and the level of tax imposed on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so. If a passenger buys a ticket from London to Edinburgh and returns a year later, having purchased a separate ticket, he may consider that he is making a return journey, but in truth they are two separate journeys, which are taxable at the full rate of £5 for each ticket purchased. However, a return ticket purchase is taxed only once. The three-day cut-off to which the hon. Lady referred does not apply. I hope that I have put her mind at rest on that point, but if there is anything else that worries her about the detailed administration or effect of the tax, I should be delighted to correspond with her.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 66 in page 10, leave out line 42 and 43.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 12 relates to the assessment of interest on duty, non-compliance, and the policing of the scheme. I suppose that it would be subject to the Paymaster General's comments about trying to minimise administrative expenditure. In particular, the clause refers to a notice of assessment of the interest on duty not paid, and it states that it shall be given to the "person liable". I hope that the amendment will prove uncontentious, bearing in mind the point that the Paymaster General has already made, that compliance with the duty is 99 per cent. I should be interested to know how much that represents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (c), which states that a representative
	<br><q><p>"is a person acting in some other representative capacity in relation to that other"</p></q>
is drafted too broadly. I am not surprised that 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on Tuesday contained an article entitled
	<br><q><p>"VAT inspectors 'do not understand laws they enforce'"</p></q>
if legislation can be so poorly drafted as to allow such a wide interpretation of who is a representative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Paymaster General will reassure the Committee that the paragraph is an important part of the clause, but paragraph (a) already specifies that someone is another's representative if
	<br><q><p>"he is that other's personal representative;"</p></q>
and paragraph (b) provides that someone is another's representative if
	<br><q><p>"he is that other's trustee in bankruptcy or is a receiver or liquidator appointed in relation to that other or in relation to any of his property".</p></q>
Those paragraphs constitute a definition that is quite wide enough. However, the clause is inadequately drafted. We are in a positive mode, and we are trying to help the Government to produce more sensibly drafted legislation that can be interpreted not only by the Committee but, it is to be hoped, by tax inspectors and by those who are liable to pay the tax. Perhaps then the tax will continue to work smoothly and we will be able to ask the Paymaster General for continued 99 per cent. compliance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to prevent the commissioners from serving a notice of assessment of interest on any representative of a person liable for that interest, other than his personal representative, his trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver or a liquidator. Its effect, therefore, would be to prevent a notice of assessment of interest from being served on anyone else, such as a solicitor or accountant, who might be the liable person's representative. That would be inconsistent with sub-paragraph (9), which provides for a notice of assessment of interest to be combined with a notice of assessment of duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A notice of assessment of duty may be served on any representative of the liable person. Therefore, it must be possible and plainly desirable to combine a notice of liability to interest with an assessment of the duty. The amendment would separate the two, which makes little sense for the administration of the tax.

I stress that the serving of a notice of assessment to interest to a representative such as a solicitor does not impose on the representative an obligation to pay the interest or duty; the provision is concerned solely with the persons on whom service may be effected. Therefore, it merely replicates the provision contained in section 12(8) of the Finance Act 1994, which was considered and approved in Committee last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee to leave the clause as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment, which was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter has been raised by the Institute of Indirect Tax Practitioners. The provision is sloppy, and I hope that we can tighten it up. It is our responsibility to ensure that legislation is as well denned and tight as possible, and that it does not give rise to ambiguity and confusion on the part of those who have to put provisions into practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The description of who can receive a notice is extraordinarily broad. It states that the person to be notified can be any
	<br><q><p>"person acting in some other representative capacity".</p></q>
It is conceivable, for example, that a Member of Parliament could fall into that definition—it is extraordinarily broad. It is in everyone's interest that we try to ensure that ambiguity on such a scale is not in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be other means of dealing with the problem, and the Paymaster General may want to come forward with other forms of words. The only option that we have at the moment is that which my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South suggests in the amendment: a deletion of paragraph 12(c), which widens the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General must explain what the words "some other representative capacity" mean; they do not mean any particular representative capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A representative is a person who acts on behalf of another in some way. Perhaps it is intended that the provision should allow a solicitor to receive a notice of assessment. As a solicitor, I would be distressed to receive such a notice because of the nature of many of the clients whom I represented as a criminal lawyer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notices would have nothing to do with an aspect in which I had not a great deal of legal competence—revenue law—nor would they be a matter on which I would want to represent many such clients, because I would be very suspicious of what receiving a notice suggested that I might be getting up to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The links between many solicitors and their clients are often tenuous. A client may come in on a particular matter and subsequently turn up for another purpose, even though a solicitor had not seen him for the intervening years. It is ridiculous that, in such an intervening period, a solicitor should have to receive a notice of assessment and somehow be able to contact his client, who may have moved many times. Because of their nature, the clients whom I represented on occasions may have moved often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
Accountants face similar problems. They may have been of past service by preparing certain types of accounts. They may not know whether they are to be recruited to provide those services in the future, yet they may arguably be deemed to be acting in some other representative capacity. They may or may not be doing so, but solicitors or accountants would not know whether they were deemed to be such a person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider a type of agent for the person who is liable for the interest, perhaps a commercial agent or land agent. Arguably, in either case, and almost certainly in the case of a land agent, such a person would have contact with the person who was liable. Is a land agent an appropriate person to receive such a notice? According to the Bill, he is. In practice, he should not be, because the matter has nothing to do with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a broader context, in the law of contract "an agent" has a particular meaning, and an agent of any sort acts in a representative capacity. An agent may have nothing to do with the tax affairs of a person who is liable for interest, yet the Bill says that a notice of assessment can be served on an agent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We get into some difficulty over interpretation, because the common or ordinary meaning of "representative" to the average citizen in the street is important for interpreting what the word means for the purposes of a court. The average citizen, when asked, "Who is your representative?", might say that his representative at work is his trade union official, that his representative on his local council is his councillor and that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South has already said, his representative in Parliament is his Member of Parliament. There are about 80,000 people in my constituency—probably more if those under the age of 18 are considered. According to this piece of sloppy draftsmanship, I could receive a notice of assessment. That really is not on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the law is clear. If the law is unclear, it is brought into disrepute, causes confusion to the citizen and necessitates businesses in particular, but also ordinary citizens who do not have great financial backing, going to the most expensive lawyers—I speak from experience—whom one could hope to recruit, or not hope to recruit. I refer to revenue lawyers, who charge enormous fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many revenue lawyers faced with legislation and a particularly difficult case would suggest that one needed not only a solicitor but, at even more expense, a barrister or, for a badly drafted piece of legislation such as this, a QC. That could be very expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sloppy draftsmanship imposes on business a burden which Conservative Members often say that they do not want to impose. I hesitate to say that that burden is due to incompetence, because the Minister did not draft the Bill, but he endorsed it and its terms are much too broad. That will not do. The Minister must accept that, although the measure may appeal to officials, it will not appeal to citizens. I can see why it might appeal to those who would deal with the notices, because it would make life easier for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tax officials who want to ensure that they can proceed to deal with the formalities of a tax issue will find it easy to give notices to persons acting in a representative capacity and will therefore have fulfilled their obligations. The measure would reduce the difficulties which confront tax officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
If the price of reducing the difficulties of collection for the Government and for their employees is to produce an injustice or circumstance that is ridiculous for the citizen because various people would be able to accept notices on his behalf, the measure is wrong and unjustifiable. It is most unjust if such a notice can be given to someone who is not in direct and immediate contact with the person who may be liable or who may need to see the notice, whether or not it imposes an immediate obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That person would then have no ability to safeguard his rights, say, to appeal or to raise queries on the notice. It is important that at no stage in a tax process—which later may impose a penalty or obligation—should anything be done of which the ordinary citizen is unaware. The law goes to great trouble to ensure that when a writ or summons is issued the person to whom it applies is informed of it. If that person cannot be found, there are various procedures for applying to the courts. Permission may be obtained to proceed in another way. This proposal contains no such element. The wording is vague. It is simply not good enough, and it needs to be changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Milburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Warwickshire, North has dealt in detail with one of the difficulties of such loose drafting. He was right to highlight some of the potential problems for those acting in "some other representative capacity".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be brief, as I know that you may be anxious to speed this aspect of the proceedings to a conclusion, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two further issues should be tackled. Time and again, hon. Members who have served on Finance Bill Committees have expressed alarm about the danger of a lack of clarity in definitions. We have subsequently received clarification, albeit a year or two down the line and too late.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is important and not just for the reasons outlined by my hon. Friends. In addition, there are dangers in allowing someone to define any other person as his or her representative. That could potentially open the floodgates to, albeit a minor but none the less explicit, form of tax avoidance. The Government have sensibly pledged to clamp down on tax avoidance and tax evasion whenever possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for intervening, but once again the hon. Gentleman makes an elementary mistake, as he should have learnt if he had read the record of last year's Finance Bill Committee proceedings. The hon. Gentleman should not be loose with words; there is an important distinction between tax avoidance and tax evasion. Tax avoidance is legal, albeit deplored by many people. Tax evasion is illegal and it constitutes fraud. The hon. Gentleman should not use words so loosely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Milburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I believe that I used the phrase "tax avoidance or evasion". However, I stand corrected, as the hon. Gentleman makes an important point. No doubt all of us would agree that tax evasion is an issue that we would want to address seriously and would want to avoid—	<i>[Laughter.]</i> These
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
things just come to me sometimes. It is something that we would want to address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, such loose wording could potentially open the floodgates to tax evasion. It could allow an unscrupulous airline customer to pass the buck to someone whom he or she defines as his or her representative. That is the important issue. We must be clear about what his or her "representative" means. I hope that the Minister will be able to assure all of us in his winding-up speech. This is not a party political issue; it is about the good management of public finances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to hear from the Minister, in the previous stand part debate, that collection rates for the duty had been as high as 99 per cent. in the first month. That is an indication of the zeal with which the new duty has been implemented. However, Customs and Excise staff, who have the duty to impose these notices, are under greater pressure than ever before. They are under pressure for good reasons, in that the Government want the maximum duty to be collected in all forms, but they are also under pressure for bad reasons. As we know from recent announcements, Custom and Excise staff numbers are being reduced and the remaining staff have more work to do. That must lead to the danger of cutting corners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a representative has been named by an individual—albeit a Member of Parliament, trade union official, local councillor, friend or neighbour—the Customs and Excise official, to expedite business, will inevitably serve the notice on that person, whether he or she is a legitimate representative or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Warwickshire, North is right to say that, once again, sloppy wording in the Bill could mean that the Government's purpose is undermined. I hope that the Minister can reassure me and my hon. Friends that the lack of definitions in this part of the Bill will be dealt with properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends the Members for Warwickshire, North and for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) have made telling points on the clause and the amendment to it. The Minister should tell us why he believes that new section 11A(12)(c) is an appropriate provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New section 11A(2) states:
	<br><q><p>"Notice of the assessment shall be given to the person liable for the interest or a representative of his."</p></q>
That makes it clear that the individual appoints the representative. The words "of his" imply an appointment by the individual of the representative. That seems a reasonable position from which to start. If a notice is served on someone who owes interest, it should be served on that person or someone whom he appoints instead of himself. That is a point of natural justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Warwickshire, North, I am not a lawyer, but, as a lay person, it seems reasonable to me that if a notice is to be sent to someone other than the individual who owes the interest, such a person must have been appointed by the individual to perform that function. It cannot be someone whom the individual owing interest has not appointed; that person would have no connection and no obligation to deal with the notice served.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister list some examples of who representatives
	<br><q><p>"acting in some other representative capacity"</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0541">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
could be? Will he define how they will be acting, who they will be and how they will be appointed? Will he also explain why they are not personal representatives? If they are personal representatives, they are covered by subsection (12)(a), and subsection (12)(c) is unnecessary. Does the Minister have such a list? If so, particular circumstances should surely be defined in (12)(c), (12)(d) and (12)(e), just as (12)(b) is defined. If the Minister has no list, is this a catch-all under which the Inland Revenue, with his support, is saying, "We are not sure, but there may be an occasion in future when we want to serve a notice and don't know who to serve it on, so, under the catch-all clause, we can serve it on anyone that we can find a postal address for"? That would not be good legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington said, there would be the problem of potential tax evasion if someone said, "I was not appointed a representative; it has nothing to do with me. How can the notice have anything to do with me and I am not paying it because I have no obligation to do so." Surely a person can only have an obligation to pay if he or she receives a personal notice or if the notice is sent to someone that he or she has appointed to do the job. That is a crucial point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must explain new section 11A (12)(c). If someone is a personal representative, it is not necessary, If not, and they have not been appointed, how can the notice be valid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 12 enables Customs and Excise to assess to amount of interest due on unpaid air passenger duty and to recover that interest as if it were duty. That was debated last year and there is a provision in the Finance Act 1994 for air passenger duty debt to carry interest. I do not think that that is in dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause simply replicates systems used in value added tax legislation for the collection of interest. As I have explained, the amendment would be highly anomalous. Subsection (9) of new section 11A provides that the notice of assessment for interest should be combined with a notice of assessment of duty. I do not think that any member of the Committee would disagree with the wisdom of that. It is already the case that an assessment of duty may be served on a representative of the liable person. It must, therefore, be in everyone's interest that the assessment of interest should also be able to be served on a person's representative. It is not in the interests of Customs and Excise to serve notices for the collection of interest on someone entirely unconnected with the person who will pay the interest and duty. Customs and Excise have a duty to collect revenue, not to allow people to avoid tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Darlington made a point about the scope for tax evasion if someone deliberately appointed or indicated a representative with whom he had no connection in order to avoid paying tax. I draw his attention to the fact that the clause does not enable the person liable for the tax to pass the buck in that way. Responsibility to pay the interest remains with the liable person—the taxpayer. The provision enables the liable person to get to know about his liability from his accountant or solicitor if such an arrangement has been made. In no circumstances can the taxpayer appoint
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
someone with whom he has no connection and direct Customs and Excise to send that person notices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Milburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. The point that I and other hon. Members, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe, were trying to make was that we want to know what safeguards there are to ensure that the liable taxpayer is in some way connected with the representative. Is there a definition of representative? Does the Minister have a list of those deemed suitable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A representative can be one of a wide variety of people who may be dealing with the tax affairs and the liability of the liable person for the duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Customs and Excise has a duty to collect the revenue and it wishes to serve notice on people who will trigger the payment of the tax. There is nothing unusual or sinister in the clause or the provision. It is contained elsewhere in tax legislation and no problems have been drawn to our attention or to the attention of Customs and Excise about it in practice. The clause is bringing together the serving of the notice for interest and for duty onto the same person. Existing arrangements provide for the liability for duty to be served on the representative person. It would be odd in the extreme if the same provision were not made for the new section that deals with liability for interest. Now that it is common elsewhere in tax law and is, in practice, workable and is for the convenience of the tax-raising authorities and the tax payer, I invite the Committee to approve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General tells us that it is not unusual or sinister to have such wording in the clause. I probably agree with him. It is sloppy, but, coming from the Government, that is neither unusual nor necessarily intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster General's argument seems to be that we need to include the clause because it would create an anomaly with other legislation. It simply replicates other VAT legislation. If this is an example of the legislation with which VAT officials have to deal, it is no wonder that my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South quoted from a newspaper article, suggesting that certain officials did not understand the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was making a separate point: it would create an anomaly between air passenger duty and the tax that we are discussing in clause 12. The clause itself would contain an anomaly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 12, even without subsection (12)(c), is very wide and I should like clarification on the issue of personal representative. Subsection (12)(a) states:
	<br><q><p>"He is that other's personal representative."</p></q>
As any of the lawyers in the Committee Room can tell us, the phrase "personal representative" has a particular meaning and role in probate or administration. We are discussing the tax liability of certain individuals, which can be passed on, in specific circumstances, to their estate. When I read that, I immediately assumed that we were discussing probate or administration. Obviously, that is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0542">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
not the case. I should like the Minister to clarify the meaning of that word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (12)(b) mentions
	<br><q><p>"that other's trustee in bankruptcy".</p></q>
In such circumstances, the trustee in bankruptcy should be fully aware of the liability of someone in terms of tax. I have no problem with that point. The subsection continues:
	<br><q><p>"a receiver of liquidator appointed in relation to that other"—</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I want to hear the hon. Gentleman who is addressing the Committee. One person speaking at a time, please.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It goes on,
	<br><q><p>"or in relation to any of his property".</p></q>
A liquidator or receiver may appear to be quite close to an individual, but that need not be the case. For example, if a company has been wound up in various different ways, the receiver or liquidator may be someone who does not have a very close contact with that affected individual. It may even be that a person has received property through inheritance which may be in the hands of others who are looking after it because of debts, and there may be very little contact with that person. There are certain degrees of risk in terms of the contact between a person who should receive the notice of assessment and the people in the clause. The clause is very wide and it has inherent risks. In subsections 12(a) and 12(b) the risks are probably quite reasonable, but subsection 12(c) goes much too wide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster General spoke of a wide variety of people who may be dealing with tax affairs. If it is just the people who will deal with that person's tax affairs, why not designate why that person should be dealing with their tax affairs? That would be far clearer. Simply to prevent anomalies in this or in other Bills is not a good reason for including some sloppy draftsmanship. The Paymaster General's answer was not very good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General seems to be missing the point. It is a poor defence that it comes from other legislation and must therefore be all right, because we should always leam from previous lessons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons for deleting subsection 12(c) have been clearly put to the Committee. A definition of "representative" needs to be qualified. 11A(2) reads:
	<br><q><p>"Notice of the assessment shall be given to the person liable for the interest or a representative of his."</p></q>
My hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe pointed out the importance of that provision. It does not refer to both the person liable and his representative. It provides for only the representative to be notified of the liability. In those circumstances, the categories of those who could be considered to be representatives should be carefully drawn. Subsections (12)(a) and (12)(b) provide for those carefully drawn categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
A representative can be someone who is the other person's personal representative. That could clearly be a solicitor, an accountant or another clearly defined representative. Subsection 12(b) qualifies further for specific instances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help the hon. Lady to know that a personal representative in subsection 12(a) has a specific legal meaning in relation to the executor or administrator of a deceased person. That is why the description "personal representative" has a deliberate and distinct difference from the use of the word "representative" elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Paymaster General for his correction on that point. In that case, if the Government's draftsmen can be so specific about the precise legal meaning in subsection 12(a), why was it beyond their ability when drafting 12(c) to provide wording that created safeguards within the clause? The safeguards are for the administration of the clause. For a series of reasons, Customs and Excise officers need clearly to understand who they are in correspondence with and the exact relationship of the representative to the liable person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanations are unsatisfactory. We seem to have dug ourselves further into confusion, because, at times, we have been discussing tight legal meanings, and at other times we have debated a catch-all clause. That convinces us that the provision is poorly drafted and that the Government should do something about it before the Bill receives Royal Assent. Perhaps by removing subsection 12(c) we shall force them to act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
