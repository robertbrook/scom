	<div class='title'>CARS: ACCESSORIES FOR THE DISABLED</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i>No. 81, in page 32, line 47, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"designed solely for use by a chronically sick or disabled person"</p></blockquote>
and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"necessarily fitted to enable a sick or disabled person to use the car".—[	<i>Mr. Nigel Jones.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 125, in page 32, line 47, leave out from "designed" to end of line 48 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and related alterations necessarily installed to permit a chronically sick or disabled person to use the car".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was interesting that, in the period since the morning sitting, we have heard the Prime Minister assert that it is the business of Government to reduce inequality and it is appropriate in that context that we should be discussing a matter relating to people with disabilities. If the Government were generous in the drafting of the clause we could do something to tackle one aspect of the inequality encountered by people with disabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is important first, because working people who are chronically sick or disabled and require a company car are more dependent on such a car than are others because of the inadequacies of the public transport system. Secondly, the clause does not relate only to top executives. Many people working in the community, such as community nurses, are entitled to company cars. Such people do not earn high wages and depend on their car to do their job, so a proper drafting will be of benefit to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I—along with other members of the Committee, no doubt—have just come from hearing representations put to us by a lobby of people with disabilities. Those at the Remploy factory in my constituency, raised that issue in the context of their ability to get to work. As an aside, I should add that it appears that Remploy gives company cars only to the managers of particular factories, none of whom are disabled. No doubt that helps to increase the deficit which Remploy now faces and which may pose a threat to the jobs of some of the registered disabled. There appears to be a shared intent across the Committee on what we want from the clause, but there have been various interpretations of whether the current drafting of the clause meets that shared objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Lady Olga Maitland) said this morning that to some people certain adaptations to a car were a luxury and to others they were a necessity. We agree with that, which is why we are anxious to know whether items such as automatic transmission or electric windows would be exempt from company car taxation. Such features may not be designed solely for the use of those registered as chronically sick or disabled, but they may be necessary for some such people to be able to use their company car. We are anxious that the wording should ensure that they get tax exemption on the additional costs of those features.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other issue which is not clear from the drafting is whether disabled people have to have sole use of their company car. Several Conservative Members suggested that that was not the case, but we have difficulty accepting that in view of the current drafting of the clause. I hope that there will be no contention over the matter in the Committee. Several members of the Committee have asked whether the drafting meets the intent. If it does not, and if the amendment is not accepted, the clause should be redrafted in time for us to consider it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warwickshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There appears broadly to be a consensus in the Committee about what should be achieved. The question is whether the wording of the clause or the amendments achieves what we want to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposal, which they put forward with good intention, contains difficulties. Problems have also arisen with amendment No. 81, and I accept that there are difficulties with amendment No. 125. There is a consensus about what should be achieved, but perhaps none of the options that we have discussed achieves it. I echo the call by my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) for the Minister to agree that there are difficulties in the drafting of the legislation. The best response that he could give to our constructive debate would be to say that he will take the legislation away and consider redrafting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) rightly identified the difficulty with the wording of the clause. He pointed out that the Bill can be read either as saying "designed solely" or as saying "solely for use by". The two phrases have to be read separately, but they overlap in the Bill. I can well imagine arguments in court about how to interpret the clause. The words "designed solely" suggest that the benefit must be for the disabled, but the words "solely for use by" suggests that no one else may use the equipment. Indeed, it is not clear whether the car or the equipment is being discussed—from the wording, it would seem that just the equipment is involved. The phrase "solely for use by" excludes equipment that others may use, including, for instance, automatic transmission. That matter must be clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have identified, to some extent, a difficulty in our amendment, but that difficulty also applies to the Government's clause. Amendment No. 125 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"related alterations necessarily installed to permit a chronically sick or disabled person to use the car".</p></blockquote>
However, a chronically sick or disabled person might never use the car, and might never have been intended to use the car. The equipment might be installed only to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
increase the value of the car for resale. In that situation, the benefits in the legislation could be claimed, because the value of the car would be increased by the company that owned it. That would be permitted by amendment No. 125. However, the Government's clause would not prohibit that use either. The clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"equipment designed solely for use by a chronically sick or disabled person".</p></blockquote>
One can imagine how alterations could be made to a vehicle, which is designed solely for use by a chronically sick or disabled person, simply to increase the value of that vehicle. No chronically sick or disabled person might ever use the vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the clause aim at what we want to achieve? Those who are chronically sick or disabled should have access to the equipment and car conversions that they need. Those adaptations should not necessarily be solely for the person who is to drive the vehicle. An able-bodied person might share a car with a disabled person and want to have the car converted for use by that disabled person. Would that fall within the parameters of the Government's intention in clause 38? Will the benefits in the clause apply to those sorts of conversions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the benefits do not apply, we are in danger of creating a discrimination between couples comprising two disabled people—who could both drive a converted car—and couples comprising one disabled person and one able-bodied person. In the latter case, the able-bodied partner would not be allowed to drive the converted vehicle. We are trying to reduce discrimination against disabled people, so we must be wary of the danger of creating a new discrimination. That issue must be addressed in the context of the wording of clause 38.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the high level of consensus on this issue among members of the Committee—we all know where we want to go and what we want to achieve. I hope that the Financial Secretary will accept that this constructive debate should result in his agreeing to re-examine the clause and, perhaps, return to the Committee with a better wording, which we all want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sir George Young)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a positive and constructive debate. The architect of most of this part of the Finance Bill was my predecessor and we have been admiring the giant clauses and coming to terms with the vision of the design. As with many great buildings, some minor details are the responsibility of pupils and lesser artists. This little clause is one of them and it has generated a great deal of debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin by explaining what the problem was and putting the Government's solution in context. I shall then explain why I believe that our solution is preferable to the approach being pressed on us both in the amendments and by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What problem does the clause seek to address? It introduces a change to the company car tax rules so that accessories designed for use by disabled people will not be included in the price of the car in calculating the benefit for tax purposes. Therefore, no tax will be charged on the value of the accessories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an employee has private use of a company car, he or she pays income tax on the benefit. That benefit is now calculated as 35 per cent. of the list price of the car, plus
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
accessories. Accessories include items specially fitted to enable a disabled person to use the car—for example, special hand controls for the clutch, brake and accelerator. In principle, and under normal tax rules, those items should be treated in the same way as other accessories and included in the price of the car in calculating the value of the benefit. That is because the benefit reflects what it would cost the individual to provide the car, plus accessories, at his or her own expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, as my predecessor explained when the treatment of those accessories under the new system for taxing cars was debated by this Committee in 1993, we did not immediately feel able to exempt the cost of the accessories from tax. However, subsequently it has been put to us that the necessary extra costs of adapting a company car for a disabled person are not the same as other accessories, for example, compact disc players, which are typically designed to enhance a driver's enjoyment. Without adaptations of the sort that we have been discussing, it simply would not be possible for a disabled person to drive a car on business or privately. However, because of necessary adaptations, a disabled person currently has to pay more tax than an able-bodied driver on what is otherwise an equivalent company car.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the arguments on both sides. I believe—and it is clear that members of the Committee believe—that fiscal principles should give way to the need to ensure that disabled people do not face a higher tax charge simply because of adaptations to a company car, which are essentially to help them to pursue their employment. As a targeted response to reasonable representations, we believe that the right way forward is to exempt the charge for accessories designed solely for the disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two ways of approaching the matter. One is to focus on the accessories, which is the Government's approach. We believe that that is right because it is the accessories and the charge for the accessories that are at the root of the problem. The other approach, which is adopted in the amendments, is to focus not on the accessories but on the disabled person. There are difficulties, which I shall explain in a moment, in going down that route—in particular, the difficulty of definition. We have a precedent for VAT on accessories and that is the way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take the Committee through the argument. The clause is commendably short—one of the shortest in the Bill—as, indeed, are the amendments. We could have proceeded with an extensive attempt to define "disability", but the debate this morning has shown how difficult it would be to define that for the specific purpose of the exemption. The use of the wording "chronically sick or disabled" has been generally welcomed by the Committee. It has a familiar ring from social security legislation over the years. But that social security legislation leads on to longer definitions of "disability" and, in turn, to powers to issue guidance to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing clear-cut in those definitions of the disabled that sheds much light on the debate today. The Government's Disability Discrimination Bill sets out a range of definitions which run to three pages. It is disproportionately lengthy for today's narrower purposes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
and therefore is not appropriate. I am not sure that it would be a firm basis for tax legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have done instead is to focus clause 38 specifically on accessories made to be sold to the disabled. That means that we can use the existing rules without more elaboration. The clause follows the approach in VAT legislation which zero rates goods and services for the handicapped, who are defined in VAT legislation as "chronically sick or disabled". That test is familiar to manufacturers and suppliers of accessories for the disabled, including car accessories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give assurances on some of the points raised. The hon. Members for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) and for Sheffield, Attercliffe asked whether an accessory, such as a wide door which could also be used by the able-bodied, would be disqualified by the provisions in the clause. The answer is no. That is well established from more than a decade of VAT tribunal cases which have considered identical wording. Indeed, the general guidance to suppliers on VAT says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"an article designed solely for the disabled remains eligible even though it may be suitable for use by other people too".</p></blockquote>
One hon. Member asked whether the disabled would have to prove their claims. In practice, the employer would return a reduced taxable benefit if he believed that the accessory qualified. It would then be for the Inland Revenue to raise any questions. In the great majority of cases, under the clause as drafted it would be obvious whether the accessory was a luxury aimed for the able-bodied or whether it was made for particular disabilities. That would be far less clear with the amendments. I am genuinely concerned that the Revenue would need to get involved in intrusive questioning about the employee's condition if we went down the alternative route of trying to link the exemption to the disability of the driver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) asked whemer the Inland Revenue would be following VAT precedents. The answer is yes. Clearly, that is every advantage in adopting the same approach for the same problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members asked whether factory-fitted items such as electric windows and automatic gearboxes would be exempt. They would not. Those goods are largely marketed to able-bodied people and would not be zero rated for VAT nor would they reduce the company car tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government accept that such accessories, fitted by the manufacturer, would sometimes be an alternative way of suiting a car to a disabled person, rather man using a specialist conversion. But, unlike some hon. Members who have spoken, we do not believe that the car tax charge on such items should be eroded as it might be by the amendments—in particular amendment No. 81, which has no "chronic" test but relies on temporary claim of disability. We have stayed with the approach known to specialist manufacturers and their advisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 38 has merits of brevity, familiarity and certainty. The amendments fall on the second and third counts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman cited examples of what would be exempt and my attention was drawn to power steering. A disabled person might require the addition of an extra handle on the steering wheel if it was necessary for him to use his
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
hands to operate the brakes, accelerator and clutch. Power steering would be essential to enable that hand-operated steering mechanism to function. Would power-assisted steering be exempted under the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the power steering would not be, but some of the additional accessories would be. Power steering is rather like electric windows and automatic transmission—it may be of benefit to disabled people, but it is also of use to able-bodied drivers. I made it clear that the exemptions do not extend to automatic transmission and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) said that the drafting of the amendments was unsatisfactory. The manufacturer who fits automatic transmission would not know whether the purchaser's employee was disabled. If the amendments were accepted, there would be a risk of general relief for all sorts of luxury items because a hypothetical disabled person might have access to the car.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary referred to power steering and automatic transmission. What would be the position if a car was purchased without automatic transmission but with an option to install that as an extra and the purchaser—the employer—exercised that option because he had a disabled employee who would be using that car?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that it would not qualify, but I am cautious about giving off-me-cuff judgments on hypothetical cases. I made it clear that automatic transmission is not designed solely for use by a chronically sick or disabled person; automatic transmission is a benefit to other people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press the point, but what would be the position if a company car was purchased without automatic transmission for a disabled person but with an option for automatic transmission designed for a disabled person?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be surprised if anyone took that route. Why not simply buy the car with automatic transmission from the word go and then adapt it? Buying it without automatic transmission, taking out the gearbox and putting in automatic transmission seems to be a more expensive way of getting to the same end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's point is a criticism of amendment No. 125. It would cover the cost of alterations, but that is unnecessary. The car tax charge is on the cost of the car plus supplying and fitting accessories to it. There is no additional cost or specific charge on alteration costs. If the accessory supplied is exempted, its fitting costs and the costs of altering the car also fall out of the car tax charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) asked for the yield of the clause. Most of the measures that are introduced by the Treasury have a yield, but this is a relieving measure. It costs. Because there are relatively few company car drivers, the total cost of the relief is small, but the benefit to the individual and the removal of a tax that is perceived to be unfair is significant. Hence the welcome for the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman stated that the benefit to the individual is great but the loss of yield is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0619">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
small. If someone with a disability needs power steering and automatic transmission, that could put another £2,000 or £3,000 on the cost of the car. That is quite a lot of money, especially if it is accepted that those who will take advantage of the measure will not, in general, be top executives. On the whole, the people who will take advantage of it will be those in the lower income bracket. Would it not, therefore, be worthwhile, if the Minister wants to measure the benefit to the individual, to amend the clause so that what are necessities to some but luxuries to others, are subject to tax exemptions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Lady's case, but if automatic transmission is exempted, for example, the mechanism that we are using can no longer be used for accessories. Questions must then be asked about the person driving the car, as we would not want to give relief on automatic transmission to someone who is able-bodied. That is why difficult questions must be asked about the definition of disabled drivers and disabled people. The Government believe that it is simpler to focus on the accessories and exempt from tax those accessories designed specifically for the disabled. That is the change, which was introduced in 1993, which has caused the perceived grievance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady makes a case for going further, and there may be good grounds for it, but it is not the proposition before the Committee. It would cost more and it goes beyond the immediate purpose which is not to tax people for accessories which are essential for them to enjoy the use of a car. The Government's approach is less intrusive to enforce; it is easier for the tax people, for manufacturers and for employers. The VAT precedent is not over-restrictive—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, the sums are small and I cannot quantify them, but, clearly, the bigger the exemption, the greater the cost, as one is reducing the tax charge by exempting more items. The sums are probably relatively small as there are few company drivers. The more that is exempt from tax—electric windows, power steering, automatic transmission, for example—the greater the loss of revenue, even though it may be from a small base.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the right hon. Gentleman's point.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The costs in terms of the Financial Statement and Budget Report are negligible. It could be about £3 million a year if there were slightly more exemptions, such as automatic transmission, but, because we do not have much data about how many drivers there are, such estimates are necessarily speculative.

This is the right approach, focused on accessories using existing precedents. It avoids intrusive questions and difficult definitions and I hope that the Committee can now make progress and resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary has not dealt with the main issue in the clause.
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
I want to press him on the matter of definitions, because it hinges on the definition of "accessory", and what is standard in a car and what is not. For instance, in many middle-range care—I do not know about the top range—power-assisted steering is not standard but is an optional extra which can be requested when purchasing a car. The same is true of electric windows, heated seats and electric control of wing mirrors. Although those accessories were not specifically designed for disabled drivers, they clearly are of benefit to them, especially power-assisted steering. The Financial Secretary said that certain items are either luxury or standard goods and if something is classed as a luxury item a tax liability must be imposed on the driver in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of clause 38 is to remove discrimination against drivers who are chronically sick or disabled, to try to create a level playing field, so that they are not disproportionately penalised by a tax regime in comparison with anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While we accept that that was the intention of the clause and we tried—perhaps unsuccessfully—to improve the wording of our amendment, there is still a point at issue. If an employer supplies standard cars—that is, cars without power-assisted steering—for most employees, but supplies care with power-assisted steering for those employees for whom it is necessary, a tax liability will be associated with employing a person who is chronically sick or disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not asking the Government to exempt all cars with power-assisted steering, electric windows, electric control of wing mirrors or heated seats, regardless of who uses them. All of those items are desirable accessories for anyone who uses a car, but are of clear benefit to the sick or disabled person. We want those items to be recognised as essentials, not luxuries, for those who have genuine need of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chronically sick or disabled are on registers, as a requirement to qualify for the orange badge scheme and other schemes, so it would be easy, even if the Financial Secretary did not want to shift the focus to the individual as opposed to the accessory, to improve the clause. With all the expert draftsmen and draftswomen in the civil service, it must be possible to make suitable amendments in response to our criticisms. Otherwise, the very benefits that would assist the drivers about whom we are talking will continue to be taxed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to imagine that any accessories that make driving easier for any driver would not be of especial benefit to the chronically sick or disabled. I ask the Financial Secretary to consider again what he said about the adaptations. We do not doubt the original intent of the clause, but it does not deliver. That is proved by what the Financial Secretary himself said: that under no circumstances would power-assisted steering be considered a necessity. The Government are making a mistake that will lead them to fail to fulfil their good intentions towards the drivers who they want to assist, and they are doing so for the sake of an amount of money so small that it cannot even be quantified.

We are dealing with the difficulties of the disabled, who have great problems in earning their living, so we should go further.

There were considerable disputes about what constituted disability—the hon. Lady mentioned one way forward—and there was detailed analysis of the orange badge scheme, which was thought to have been substantially abused. As a result of that abuse, the whole scheme was reviewed, and the disability criteria greatly tightened up. That could be the precedent. If the car user is a current orange badge holder, he should be entitled to an exemption for all adaptations that could be of benefit to the disabled. I urge my right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Financial Secretary a few questions. It is an intriguing clause. It is a mystery because it was not mentioned in the Budget press release. It is primarily directed at closing schemes involving interest-free or low-interest loans from employers to higher-paid employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under existing rules, an employee would be assessed on the benefit in kind representing the difference between the interest paid and the interest that would have been paid if a market rate had applied. Will the Financial Secretary explain what types of case the clause is designed to prevent? Although we expect the proper rate of tax to be paid on loans and do not want loopholes to appear, we are not clear as to the aim of the clause. It would be helpful if the Financial Secretary could tell us what happens now, but would not be permitted in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Carrington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fulham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Lady. Those of us who are hardy annuals on the Committee remember that we debated this subject last year, which resulted in the then Financial Secretary agreeing to come back with the clause before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause resolves the problem that was described last year. There is general consensus in the House that companies should pay their employees a salary in cash and that they should not be encouraged to pay them in benefits. One of the benefits that has grown up largely because of quirks in the tax system is that of low-interest loans. They have been predominant in the financial sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0621">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
A problem arose in companies that wanted to stop providing beneficial loans at cheap interest rates to their employees. If they said that they would stop the scheme and would give the loans' portfolio to an outside lender whose business is providing loans to employees, the transference of the beneficial loans to the new lender would be at commercial rates of interest. However, those loans would still be treated as beneficial loans for tax purposes. I do not need to remind the Committee that the taxation rules for beneficial loans, even when they are provided at a commercial rate of interest, can be disadvantageous to the borrower. The Revenue will look at an assumed rate of interest on the beneficial loan that is frequently higher than the rate of interest on a commercial loan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a complicated way of describing the problem. The clause is designed to reverse the position in which companies that wished to cease providing beneficial loans to their employees were encouraged not to do so. In fact, they had a financial disincentive against providing employees with commercial loans. This clause is complex because of all its anti-avoidance provisions. It allows companies to move their loan portfolios to a commercial lender and to remove themselves from the beneficial loan business without causing any financial disadvantage to their employees, other than that of losing a cheap loan.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come to a small group of related clauses, which can be tackled promptly. However, I should like some explanation of one or two important points. The clause would broaden the sort of investment that will qualify for capital gains tax reinvestment relief.
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
It stems form a proposal that was introduced in the 1993 Budget to allow reinvestment relief on specific sorts of activity. As I understand it, the Government are trying to bring the regime for reinvestment relief more into lien with the enterprise investment scheme. The Government want to deal with two specific matters. Until now, some sorts of business have been excluded from reinvestment relief—namely, farming and property development and companies in which more than half the assets consist of land. I shall deal with he two categories separately because they have separate implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall deal with companies in which more than half the assets consist of land. The problem is quite simple. A company's only asset may be a warehouse or a place of business. If relief is not allowed, a company that is conducting wholly desirable business, which all members of the Committee would like to encourage, is excluded simply because it owns a warehouse that comprises half its assets. The Government introduced the exemption in 1993 and refused to allow relief for companies that owned property that comprised more than half their assets because they wanted to prevent people form investing or getting tax relief for investing in property development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we said when we debated the provisions on the Floor of the House, we are keen to encourage investment. Therefore, we are keen to allow reinvestment relief on investment in items that would not otherwise attract investment, especially high-tech and high-added-value goods. I have some sympathy with the view that we should not strike at companies that are excluded simply because their main asset is the building in which they operate. Our reaction tot he provision will depend on The Financial Secretary's response to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to draw out the Financial Secretary on amendment No. 127. The provision to which it applies means that the Government are now allowing reinvestment relief on property development and farming companies. Will that mean that farmers will be encouraged to incorporate themselves in order to get the re-investment relief? That is a simple point, which I am sure that the Government have taken into account. I am not sure that we want to encourage or force people to do that. Why are we giving re-investment relief for property development? I shall quote, yet again, my favourite Cabinet Minister, the former Financial Secretary to the Treasury who is now the Secretary of State for National Heritage. I am sorry to let down the Chief Secretary to the Treasury—he is not on my list of favourite Cabinet Ministers. The former Financial Secretary said, in an excellent speech considering the business expansion scheme delivered two years ago, that the Government seemed to send all the wrong signals in attracting investment. He said that people were investing in property development and granny farming—or something along those lines—which brought no benefit to the country as a whole. The situation was so bad that the Government put a stop to it—that was when the former Financial Secretary had power over such matters and before he moved on to pastures new.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not convinced that there is any need for us to give re-investment relief—we are always being told that it is taxpayers' money—to property development. Frankly, people will invest in that sort of area anyway. Property will, for a long time to come, be a safe investment.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
Perhaps, if the situation stabilises, it will not collapse in the future. Anyone's portfolio is bound to contain an element of property and that state of affairs is likely to remain. If we intend to give relief, do we want to give it for property development? I shall be interested to hear the Government's justification for relief on property development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear why it is necessary to provide relief on farming companies. I understand that some social policy might be involved to ensure that family farms remain in existence and do not have to be sold off. Typically, farming companies are not incorporated bodies—they are partnerships or sole traders. It will be interesting to know from the Financial Secretary what the rationale is. When the Government introduced the scheme in 1993 it was decided, as a matter of policy, that those activities would be excluded. What has changed? Why are we being invited to endorse that change? It would be helpful if the Financial Secretary would explain to the Committee why that has been done and what assessment the Government have made of the cost of the additional tax relief to the Exchequer. I am sure that they have made such an assessment because they are always telling us that the stewardship of the public funds is of a high order. I am sure that no tax break would have been given without a detailed assessment having been made. Unless, as is usual, someone was nobbled somewhere and, having been asked why relief could not be given for a spot of property development responded by saying, "I'll see what I can do."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government intend to allow further concessions in future? Current exclusions are dealing in land, financial instruments, banking, insurance, leasing and legal and accountancy services. If the Government think that farming ought to be encouraged why are they discriminating against lawyers? I am not arguing that we should extend any tax concession or give relief to those people investing in legal services—I am not altogether sure that that is a deserving cause. As you, Mr. Hogg, observed earlier, I have some experience of such matters. I am still a member of the Faculty of Advocates although I am no longer practising. Perhaps if the Government privatise drafting, I might want to reconsider my position as the fees seem to be generous and high. At least, my hon. Friend the Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon) tells me that that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Financial Secretary tell us why the Government intend to give the additional concessions and will he give us the economic justification and cost of doing so. We are entitled to know that. I refer to a point covered in amendment No. 126—I seek clarification from the Government on their intentions for companies that have assets, half of which consist of property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As some colleagues will recall, I have argued before about roll-over relief clauses and I am very much against the previous rule whereby if property accounted for more than 50 per cent. of qualifying assets, the roll-over reliefs were not available. When I have spoken before, I do not remember the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) having supported my arguments. However, whether from hearing them subconsciously or from another source, he seems to have been converted to them. I am very glad of that and am even more delighted that the Government have rethought the matter. I remember using
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
an example in 1993 of a company which had total qualifying assets of £4 million and a warehouse worth £2.1 million, so did not qualify. Had the warehouse been worth £1.9 million and had the company spent £200,000 on old masters for the boardroom, it would have qualified. That was crazy and the Government have done well and should be congratulated for removing an anomaly that was probably never intended, but which was introduced by the Taxes Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agreed with the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central when he said that it is wrong that the Taxes Act 1988 should attempt to bias people who are going into business in favour of or against incorporation. I must ask my right hon. Friend why we have not extended the roll-over relief in clause 40 to the roll-over of business assets into an unincorporated business. No doubt we shall hear from my right hon. Friend that the Inland Revenue consider that it would be impossible to police it or to distinguish between business assets held properly and exclusively for the purpose of business and what could be called personal assets. Every time the Revenue examines the accounts of a business that is trading as a principal or unincorporated business it has to police the issues as to the allocation of costs—identifying the costs properly and necessarily incurred in the business. There is a danger that the business man or business woman may be tempted to carry an element of personal expenditure in those accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a familiar problem. It is possible, if one is the sole owner of, say, a closed business, to divert some of one's supposed business assets to personal use. If that is to be my right hon. Friend's argument, I hope that he will take the discussion a little further. Once again, there is a distortion in the Taxes Act 1988 between incorporated and unincorporated business that is fundamentally unjustified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause relaxes some of the restrictions on qualifying investment for capital gains tax reinvestment relief. From 29 November 1994, property development and farming will be qualifying activities and investments in companies holding more than 50 per cent. of their assets as land on or after that date will also qualify. Reinvestment relief defers any charge to capital gains tax on a disposal of an asset when the gain is reinvested in shares in a qualifying company. The scheme is carefully designed to ensure that it promotes investment in the sort of sector that we are trying to help. The sort of company that we have in mind is, broadly speaking, unquoted, trading and engaged in high-risk activities. The parent holding company of such a company can also qualify. Such a company tends to be small and can find it hard to attract equity investment both because of the risks associated with such investment and the difficulties potential investors may have in selling shares later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would help us if the Minister could remind us of the definition of "high-risk activity".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that there is a legal definition of high risk. I was describing the sort of companies that have difficulty raising capital—such as some companies engaged in high-risk activities. I went on to try to arrive at a definition based on a tendency to smallness and difficulty in attracting equity investment, because of the risks associated with that and the difficulty that potential investors might have in selling shares later.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0623">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>207</span>
Reinvestment relief is designed to compensate for some of those disadvantages and so to promote investment in young or small companies that are likely to form a vital source of future economic growth. Without the help such companies can be stunted, or even fail ever to get off the ground, because of their inability to attract investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme was first introduced in 1993 and since then we have kept a careful watch to assess how it meets its objectives. There is a balance to be struck between rules that are tight enough to ensure that only the targeted sector benefits and rules that are not so tight as to exclude deserving cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that we have more experience of the scheme's operation it has become clear that some of the restrictions are no longer appropriate. In particular, it is not unusual for more than half a new company's assets to take the form of land or buildings. We are therefore removing the restriction that prevents such companies from qualifying. Similarly, the scheme originally excluded companies involved in farming or property development. That reflected the feeling of the time that those were low-risk activities. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central asked what has changed. The answer is that what may have been the case in the 1980s is clearly no longer so. The changes will bring reinvestment relief more into line with the enterprise investment scheme. It will slightly simplify the tax system and will reduce compliance burdens for companies that no longer have to worry about complying with the interest in land test. It will also remove genuine uncertainties about what constitutes farming. I was asked about the estimated cost, which would be about £20 million in a full year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 126 and 127 would reimpose certain restrictions on qualifying activities for reinvestment relief. The interest in land test would be reimposed and amendment No. 127 would continue the exclusion of companies engaged in property development or farming. We have discussed the interest in land test at length on the Floor of the House. It was an onerous and blunt instrument and in many cases denied relief to new companies that owned their premises and which, because they were new, had few other assets. That is not unusual and it makes no sense to exclude precisely the sort of company that we are trying to help. In many instances it was impossible for bona fide commercial companies to satisfy the land test. There is some evidence that companies decided not to use that and similar reliefs precisely because of the interest in land test. That is why clause 40 removes the restriction that prevents companies for qualifying if they hold a large proportion of their assets as land or buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 40 brings reinvestment relief more into line with the enterprise investment scheme, simplifying the tax system. It is worth reminding hon. Members, since Opposition Members keep quoting the Law Society, that the Law Society said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"many bona fide trading companies, although not property-based, will not satisfy the requirement that the value of their interest in land does not exceed half the value of the company's assets as a whole. Further, although the test may initially be satisfied, it may inadvertently be breached subsequently during the relevant period. Although the effect will be to exclude asset-backed companies, the restrictions will extend more widely than this."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
I see no virtue in amendments Nos. 126 and 127. It makes no sense to impose the restrictions that some hon. Members have urged. The yield of amendment No. 127 would be £5 million and that of amendment No. 126 £15 million, bringing in the £20 million that I mentioned a few moments ago. I hope that the Committee will resist the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have less difficulty over amendment No. 126 relating to the 50 per cent. rule, and am prepared to await developments and see how arrangements work, but I am worried about relaxing restrictions on reinvestment relief because much experience shows that giving more and more such relief does not result in any gain for the country and sends the wrong signals. Treasury Ministers should re-read the excellent speech on the role of economic policy given by the present Secretary of State for National Heritage in May 1993. It bears repetition:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But it was built on sand. The wheeler-dealer was the man of the moment. The best returns were to be found in trading financial assets. Demand for property seemed inexhaustable."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the system was giving the wrong signals. Far from being sure-fire winners, many were, in fact, sure-fire losers. We see them today marked by To Let boards outside brand-new buildings that will never make a return for the people who built them".</p></blockquote>
I believe that that is an accurate assessment of what happened. In a curious way, the present Financial Secretary has used that argument to support his proposition that property development is high risk and ought to be encouraged. Perhaps it is no bad thing that it should be high risk. There was a substantial collapse in the property market in the mid-1970s and another in the late-1980s and early-1990s. Huge property developments took place in London—in the area around Broadgate, for example. One or two of the major national banks, as well as companies and individuals, were badly burned. Do we really want to encourage people to return to that? It is no bad thing for public policy if people think several times before investing in a property company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, we all agree that certain activities, such as house building, are probably a good thing. I appreciate that it is difficult, though not impossible, when drawing up statutes to distinguish between one sort of property development and another sort, but I must question the sense of giving a tax break to encourage people to invest in property. We always hear from Conservative Members that we should not distort the market, but we are doing so here. I believe that there are good reasons for distorting the market in many cases, but I am not convinced that property development is one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I press the hon. Gentleman on where he would draw the line? He has said that he thinks there might be a case for house building. What about starter industrial units—so-called nursery units—which are highly speculative but without which many small companies would not have the sort of premises from which they could start up? I could go on, but the point is that there is clearly a gradation. Even Broadgate provided facilities for the City of London without which it could probably not compete in the modern financial market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The European bank for reconstruction and development springs readily to mind. Had it not been there, hewers of marble, designers of mirrors and painters of portraits would have been out of work. I am told that the catering in there is pretty good as well.

I take the hon. Gentleman's point that it is difficult when passing into law provisions that have to apply across the board to distinguish between industrial estate starter units—which most of us would probably agree with—and speculative development. The difference is difficult to define, just as, in the old phrase, it is difficult to describe an elephant—but one knows it when one sees it.

The Government ought to mink long and hard on this. They will get their way tonight, even though we shall vote for our amendment because they have a majority on the Committee and in the House, but I hope that they will examine how it works in practice. They should have been warned because they have form on this issue. They know the mistakes that can be made and I do not see why they should walk into them again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far from sounding like new Labour, the hon. Gentleman sounds like unreconstructed old labour. He sounds like George Brown, who believed that there was something inherently unproductive about investment in commercial property, or like the Labour party of the 1930s and 1940s, which believed that speculation was not a useful economic activity. A speculative builder takes a substantial risk and produces a considerable amount of wealth as a result. He may well go broke, in which case he will not have benefited from the development, but somebody will. The rule in real estate is that somebody—it could be the third, fourth or fifth owner—eventually benefits from it and national wealth is enhanced thereby.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has forgotten that he should be making an intervention, but it seems that he is making a speech. Is he making a speech or an intervention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Hogg, you are quite right to pull me up—it is an intervention. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman realises that he is projecting on old-fashioned picture of the Labour party as the nanny state taking a prescriptive view of what is or is not a useful economic activity and second-guessing investment decisions in the private sector. The Labour party has neither learnt nor forgotten anything at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is arguing in favour of distorting the market, which I always understood a true Thatcherite would argue should never be done. Indeed, I was taking as my text the words of the Secretary of State for National Heritage—never mind new or old Labour. I shall have to report to the right hon. Gentleman that, judging from the reaction of Conservative Members, he will get no votes from the Tories on this Committee at the next leadership election. They do not seem to agree with his sensible speech, but I would commend it to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We should encourage investment. We can justify either tax foregone or other concessions where there is a net gain

for the country in terms of investment. I concede that it is not easy to distinguish between one sort of property development and another. The right hon. Gentleman would probably disagree with granny farming and agree with building new houses. All I am saying is that the Government must watch like hawks because the experience with the business expansion scheme was that far from the country gaining, all that happened was that the spivs—who tend to lurk around that area—took the tax breaks and gave nothing back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Monetary policy is now firmly controlled. As my right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon.

	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a brief question. The clause closes one of the loopholes that did not exist in October 1994, but which was subsequently found to exist in November. How much revenue was lost prior to the closing of the loophole? To put the question another way, how much does the Financial Secretary reckon that closing the loophole will save per annum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked a brief question, to which there is a brief answer. The problem with the loophole was that tax advisers publicised it in technical tax publications. The situation necessary to exploit the meekness in the legislation was relatively easy to contrive and it is appropriate that steps should now be taken to protect the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the amount of tax that is at risk. The amount could become significant, which is why we announced on 20 June 1994 our intention to make the changes. The clause is backdated, so it will protect the tax flow to the Exchequer and restore the basis of the relief to its intended area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central will be delighted to hear that the tax loss was negligible because the loophole was closed as soon as it became evident and because it is backdated to 20 June 1994. Against that comforting news, I hope that the Committee will make progress with the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Minister and others to know that my questions on this clause are similar to those that I asked about clause 41. How much was lost before the clause, which gives effect to existing Revenue practice, was implemented? What is the estimated cost of extending roll-over relief to compulsorily purchased land?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it helps the Minister to have a little more time to prepare his answer, I shall make an observation. It is curious that a loophole only becomes a loophole when the Treasury reads about it in a glossy magazine. Every time that Labour Members point out loopholes that need to be closed, we are roundly told that there are none, but when the loophole is pointed out in a glossy tax magazine there is a different response. I have spoken long enough to give the Minister time to prepare his reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should briefly like to ask a question, to which I do not expect an answer this
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
evening. Double standards seem to be involved. I know of many companies that secure roll-over relief as groups of companies. Individual companies then manage to access Government funds, for example through the enterprise initiative consultancy, because they have operational independence in their own right. It appears that some companies within groups are trying to have it both ways. I hope that the Minister will write to me about that—I understand that he is going to write to me about venture capital trusts, but I am still waiting for that response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith (Beaconsheld)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the purpose of the clause is to give statutory effect to an extra-statutory concession, number D30. The Public Accounts Committee has regularly called for all extra-statutory concessions to be given statutory effect on the basis that it is unsatisfactory for taxpayers if such matters are not dealt with in the law but by fiat from the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Treasury's usual response to the PAC's suggestion that all concessions should be given statutory effect, is that there is no room in the Bill—I would be the first to sympathise with that, given its size. Why is this concession to be given statutory effect at this time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central referred to revenue loss. That loss on roll-around, which is relevant to the second part of the clause, is small, but would have become significant if we had not taken specific steps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield is right—the main change made by the clause is purely technical, designed to give statutory backing to long-standing Inland Revenue practice. He was also right to remind us that the PAC takes a dim view of that. In practice, the Revenue has always allowed a gain made by one member of a group of companies to be rolled over into an acquisition by another group member. Recent court judgments revealed that that practice was extra-statutory and that roll-over relief was statutorily due only when the same group member made both the disposal and the acquisition. The clause allows roll-over relief to be given to groups on the same basis as it was given previously. The short answer to my hon. Friend's question is that the recent court judgments exposed the practice as extra-statutory. We have taken steps to validate it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is another loophole-closing clause which will close what is called the envelope trick. I am grateful that the Minister did not describe it because that would take some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman will be aware that I recently tabled a written question asking how much revenue has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0626">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
been lost up to now by not closing the envelope-trick loophole. In his reply, he said that the amount of money lost so far was negligible. However, he went on to observe that if not closed, the loophole would result in a loss of significant amounts. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This loss could amount to many tens of millions of pounds."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 6 February 1995; Vol. 254, 	<i>c.</i> 70.]</p></blockquote>
It is curious that that loophole, which is minding its own business—no one has noticed it; no money is being lost—must be closed to prevent millions of pounds flowing out of the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that, yet again, the Minister's authority for introducing this measure is the fact that someone wrote an article in a magazine drawing attention to the loophole. That is a curious way for the Government to go about closing tax loopholes. For the past two years, we have suggested that the Government might want to pay far greater attention to closing loopholes. The Financial Secretary's predecessor, who is usually put up to denounce such suggestions, always says that there are no loopholes to close because the Government are always vigilant. Yet every year the Chancellor finds some more. It is curious that before anything is done, someone has to write an article in a magazine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also find it strange when the right hon. Gentleman says that negligible money has been lost, but if the Committee does not agree to the clause, tens of millions of pounds will be lost. It is a very odd way of doing business, which undermines the Government's assertions and cries of anguish that we hear whenever we raise the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been good enough to concede that the Bill contains a large amount of anti-avoidance legislation, so I hope that we shall hear slightly less from him and his hon. Friends about the Government being sympathetic to tax avoidance. We have introduced clause after clause blocking off loopholes. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that the problem can be dealt with in one Finance Bill, he has a naive approach to the whole business of tax avoidance and to the progressive move by tax advisers and everyone else to find their way around the system. One must be ever-vigilant and take fresh steps as they become necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman kindly suggested that I should not explain the envelope trick; I will not. Avoidance is now being discussed widely in the professional press and at tax conferences. As I said in my reply, if the hole is not plugged, significant tax could be lost to the Exchequer amounting to many tens of millions of pounds. We will be ever-vigilant, and if we hear of more tax avoidance ruses, we will take action, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman would never suggest that the problem can be put right in one Bill and then forgotten about. That is simply not how the real world operates and I have no doubt that there will be more anti-avoidance measures in the next Finance Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lawyers and accountants make a very good living looking for tax loopholes. I concede that it cannot all be done in one day. Like painting the Forth rail bridge, which, incidentally, the Government have also given up doing because of privatisation, closing tax loopholes is something that we must keep doing. No doubt, Treasury officials are now attending tax conferences to see what the state of the art is. I applaud that and I must tell the Financial Secretary that many people wish that the Government would spend as much political time and effort chasing tax evasion as they spend on other matters of public spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question on clause 44 is one that I have already asked. The revenue effect of the clause is said to be negligible at less than £3 million a year. Will the Financial Secretary confirm that? As this is the concluding debate on this part of the Bill, at least for the time being, I want to say that we welcome the Government's efforts to close tax loopholes, but there is much more to do and we should be happy to make a series of suggestions about where the Government might usefully turn their attention next. The Government need as much revenue as they can collect and, therefore, they need Inland Revenue staff to be motivated and encouraged to pursue tax evasion and tax loopholes. We need a new political direction to pursue those matters. Some starts have been made, which is why we have been happy to support the last few clauses, but the Government have much more to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty with the Opposition's approach to anti-avoidance measures is that many of their proposals would impinge on entirely legitimate business activities. The Treasury and the Inland Revenue must adopt an entirely pragmatic approach. There is not much point in looking for devices that have not yet come to the attention of taxpayers, but if taxpayers are advised by professional people, whether they are lawyers or accountants, that there is a way of avoiding tax which Parliament did not intend—and I am sure that, in a Bill of this size, we shall inadvertently create more tax avoidance opportunities—surely it is right that action should be taken to deal with those loopholes as soon as they come to the attention of the Treasury and the Inland Revenue. My right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench would be subject to more criticism if the answer to the question, "How much revenue will be saved?" was, "A large sum of money." That would suggest that they had not acted as quickly as they should have done. If the answer was that they had dealt with the matter as soon as it came to their attention, what more could one reasonably ask?

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice in the Red Book that the total revenue from anti-avoidance measures will be £100 million next year. That is a substantial amount of tax to save. If it was a lot more, Ministers would be subject to more criticism. Such matters can be dealt with not on a theoretical basis but on a practical basis. If an article in the professional press brings a device to the attention of the Inland Revenue, so be it. That is the point at which more currency is given to the device. Many more taxpayers and their advisers will start taking advantage and that is the point at which to move in and kill it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the specific question of costs, the reply is indeed that which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central anticipated. The revenue effect will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
negligible at present but will cut off potentially significant future loss of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend to put more resources into compliance within the Revenue, partly for the reasons that have been outlined. We believe that that is essential to the integrity and credibility of the tax system.
