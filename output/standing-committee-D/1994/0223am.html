	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hilary Armstrong 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Durham, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 247, in page 78, line 34, after "tax" insert "at the basic rate".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When you called our amendment, Mr. Winterton, I was enjoying a discussion with the Financial Secretary about the really interesting business we should reach next week on self-assessment—although you, Mr. Winterton, might not think that that is the most exciting business to Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 78 attempts to correct a long-standing anomaly. Our amendment is a probing one to clarify what the Government expect the clause to cost. We will be discussing four clauses this morning that deal with tax reliefs. Opposition Members have been cautious to ensure that the Government do not allow any tax relief to turn quickly into a means of abuse and a tax loophole. Post-cessation receipts have been discussed in previous Finance Bills. However, this year we have a whole raft of new proposals. The anomaly addressed by the clause has been recognised by the Committee previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is appropriate, I should like to ask several questions, some of which are directly related to the amendment and some of which are more general. Why is the relief to be made available only to individuals and not to companies? Why is it applicable only to income tax and not to corporation tax? Why is it restricted to setting expenditure against income and capital gains in the year in which it is to be paid? We have received representations that that is inconsistent with the provisions regarding losses which, for individuals under self-assessment, can be carried back and set against income in the previous year of assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several groups, including the Faculty of Taxation, the Chartered Institute of Taxation and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland, have told us that the seven-year limit is inadequate. I want to make it clear that the questions I am asking have been put to us. I am not sure that the Opposition would support all the submissions, but I should like the Minister to deal with them. The groups explained that a person normally has six years in which to make a claim and that any payment is made several years after that claim is received. In cases
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
involving, for example, the construction or waste industries, up to 20 years may elapse before claims are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A problem arises when an executor makes a claim in respect of a payment made by a deceased taxpayer. Can the Minister confirm that the relief would be available in such a case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are attempting to correct an anomaly in a way that recognises that sometimes payments must be made even after trade has stopped. The clause addresses the question whether the liability should be the same as it was before trade ceased. I would be grateful if the Minister could answer those questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sir George Young)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady said, the clause has been widely welcomed because it puts right a perceived injustice. I shall explain briefly what the clause does and then go on to deal with the hon. Lady's questions. The hon. Lady asked what the cost will be—the answer is £10 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause introduces a new relief for expenditure incurred by individuals after a business has ceased, such as professional indemnity insurance premiums. I shall explain in a moment why companies are excluded. The intention is to relieve genuine trading expenses, which do not, at present, qualify for tax relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, no relief is available under the tax system for expenditure incurred after a business has ceased unless the expenditure is provided for in the final accounts or there are post-cessation receipts against which the post-cessation expenditure can be set. Relief against post-cessation receipts will continue. The new provision relieves certain post-cessation expenditure, closely related to the trading or professional activities while they were carried on, against income and capital gains where that relief cannot be given immediately under the present rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new relief is limited to particular types of loss or expenses which can be seen to relate directly to the business activities—for example, the costs of remedying defective work done, goods supplied or services rendered while the business was continuing, and damages paid by the taxpayer in respect of such defective work, goods or services whether awarded by a court or agreed during negotiations on a claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further categories of expenditure which will be relieved under the provision are: legal and other professional expenses incurred in connection with such costs; insurance premiums paid to insure against such costs or expenses; and the costs of collecting debts which have been taken into account as turnover in computing the profits of the trade before discontinuance. In addition, debts owed to the business which have been taken into account in computing the profits or gains of the trade or profession before discontinuance, but which have subsequently become bad, will be treated as an expense within the new relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady referred to the timing of the new relief and asked why relief would be given at the time the expenditure was paid, rather than set against the trading income prior to cessation. The answer is that that would mean re-opening assessment on the trading profits several
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0752">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>437</span>
years after the assessments were settled, and neither the Revenue nor taxpayers would welcome that. Giving relief when the expenditure is actually paid is much more straightforward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady then asked why the new relief is limited to a period of seven years after trade ceases. It may be that some post-cessation expenditure can be paid for more than seven years, but as the allowable expenses have to be related to the trading activities, it would be more difficult to see such a nexus the longer the time period that had elapsed since the trade ceased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The seven-year limit is also close to the general limit of six years under the statute of limitations, which will apply to many of the expenses arising out of late claims against the trader or losses on debts which he may be entitled to pursue. There is also a certain symmetry in that pre-trading expenditure relief is limited to expenditure in the seven-year period prior to the commencement of trading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked why the new relief is limited to individuals and excludes companies. I think that, on reflection, she will accept that an individual who ceases trading but continues to exist as an individual may have continuing liabilities, but when a company ceases to trade there are no continuing liabilities for anybody to impose on. To that extent, the parallel between individuals and companies is not exact. The introduction of the new relief into the corporation tax system would also introduce unwelcome complications because the relevant corporation tax rules are different from, and, on the whole, more complex than the income tax rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady then spoke—though without great feeling—to her amendment, which she happily described as a probing amendment. I have to say that it is not one that the Government would accept. She did not make clear why she woud wish to restrict the relief that I have just spoken about to basic rate when expenditure is set against other income. She also left out the option of setting expenditure against capital gains tax, which is an anomaly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the structural weaknesses in the amendment, I am not persuaded of the case. It would introduce an unnecessary complication, inconsistent with the current scheme for relieving trading losses at a person's marginal rate of tax, be that the lower rate, the basic rate or the higher rate. If expenditure would have been relieved at marginal rates if incurred while a business was carried on, why should not it be relieved at marginal rates when incurred after the business has ceased?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the hon. Lady not to press her amendment to a Division. I hope that I have given her some of the background reasons why the clause is in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My amendments are rather technical. The clause is a consequence of a debate that we had in Committee on the Finance Bill last year and it achieves most of what we were seeking by altering the provisions of last year's Finance Act on the taxation of insurance for directors' liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to delay the Committee on my technical amendments, but they would make some important improvements to the clause. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will consider them and, perhaps, accept at least some of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 138 would broaden the restriction specified in the Bill which limits the offset of the insurance premium against a fairly limited definition of the emoluments of directors and officers. There is a straightforward problem with that, which we shall encounter again under clause 80. In certain cases, the insurance premium for such liabilities to be paid by directors and officers is substantial and may well exceed the emoluments received in one year—and, very possibly, those that would be gained under the definition in section 201AA(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would allow the insurance premium to be set off against several years' income to enable directors to make full use of the tax relief and not restrict them to the tax relief for the current year. That point is picked up in clause 80, so it probably does not constitute a major philosophical change to the procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 139 is similar to Government amendment No. 145. I am grateful to the Government for tabling that amendment because it has much the same effect. It would remove the restriction that the liability of the director or officer must be other than to his employer or ex-employer. If a director or officer is sued, and the insurance cover applies, it is likely, for legal reasons, that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0753">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>439</span>
the person suing would be his employer or ex-employer. But, as that is covered in much the same way by Government amendment No. 145, I need not spend any more time discussing my amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 140 would remove the word "exclusively" from clause 79, page 82, line 4. As a result, the insurance that can be taken out can, to a great extent, reflect normal practice. The insurance policy tends to be a basket policy, which covers a collection of risks, one of which is directors' and officers' liability. The amendment's purpose is to ensure that, although an insurance policy may cover other risks, it would still be possible for the part of the policy that covers directors' and officers' liabilities to be apportioned for tax relief. The amendment attempts to bring clause 79 into line with commercial practice in the insurance market. Theoretically, it would be possible for directors and officers to restructure their insurance so that they have separate policies to cover that liability, but it seems unnecessary to force that change on them for tax reasons when the same effect can be achieved by apportionment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 143 alters clause 79 to make it clear that the disallowance arises in relation to uninsurable liabilities and costs. As presently worded, the capacity of the employer unlawfully to take out insurance is the problem. The focus of the clause seems to be to state that it is unlawful for the employer to take out certain insurance, whereas the amendment would limit the deduction for tax purposes to those liabilities that are insurable. In considering such insurance, what is important is the nature of the liability; not the capacity of the employer to take out the insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are somewhat technical. However, they would bring this welcome clause into line with normal market practice. They would add a few bells and whistles to a good clause to make it perfect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause has an impeccable pedigree. When the Finance Bill was debated last year, my hon. Friends the Members for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill), for Fulham (Mr. Carrington) and for Slough (Mr. Watts) tabled amendments that were welcomed by both sides of the Committee. My predecessor undertook to consult on making possible changes to the law and to consider bringing forward proposals for legislation in this year's Bill. That is what we have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will introduce a new tax relief, which will start on 6 April 1995, for employees who incur expenditure on indemnity insurance and on certain uninsured liabilities such as legal costs that relate to their work. It thereby cancels out any tax charge when indemnity insurance or uninsured liabilities are paid for or provided by the employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Payments by employees or directors for indemnity insurance, such as directors' and officers' liabilities insurance—D and O, as it is known—or professional indemnity insurance do not at the moment qualify for relief. That is because the expenditure fails the strict schedule E expenses rule, by not being incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of one's duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Payments by employers to provide indemnity insurance, which protects employees or directors, are
	<span class='label label-info column'>440</span>
taxable as a benefit-in-kind for directors and to those employees earning £8,500 a year or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Payments by employees or directors for uninsured personal liabilities, which arise from their activities at work—such as legal costs in defending an action that is brought against them—also do not qualify for relief. Payments by employers to meet employees' or directors' uninsured personal liabilities are taxable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take the debate forward from last year, the Inland Revenue published a consultative document in May. There was a strong response. We listened to representations, and have responded positively. The new tax relief in the clause is comprehensive. It will cancel out any benefit-in-kind charge on directors and employees whose indemnity insurance premiums are paid for by their employer. It will also ensure that no tax will arise on payments by employers to meet employees' uninsured liabilities that arise from their work, when the liabilities could have been insured against. In line with the elimination of tax on employer-funded insurance and uninsured liabilities, it will give employees relief for the cost of providing their own insurance or having to meet their own uninsured liabilities. Costs and liabilities that arise from criminal convictions, which cannot be insured against, will not attract relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new relief will also have a deregulatory effect. It will enable employers to apply for dispensations and so avoid the need to provide the Revenue with details of indemnity insurance that is provided for employees or payments of uninsured liabilities. A dispensation will spare employers the task of apportioning indemnity insurance premiums between the employer and the employees, and between the individual employees, in order to arrive at the benefit-in-kind. I therefore hope that the clause is generally acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 145 relates to the provisions that give relief to directors' and employees' liability insurance and work-related uninsured liabilities, as I have just explained. However, as drafted the provisions in clause 79 would give no relief for premiums for liability insurance policies that cover a director's or an employee's liability to the employer. Similarly, any payment of a director's or an employee's uninsured liability, when the liability is to the employer, would not qualify for relief. There would also be no relief under clause 80 when the premiums related to liability to a former employer. That is because, during consultation, we focused on liabilities to third parties rather than to the employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, since the publication of the Finance Bill it has been put to us that the exclusion of liabilities to the employer would disqualify many existing policies from the new relief. That is not a result that we intended. It has also been put to us that the absence of relief where liability is to the employer, as opposed to a third party, is unfair. Liability might arise when, for example, shareholders pressed a company to take action against a director for a wrong investment decision instead of the shareholders bringing the action directly. Liability in those circumstances can be and is properly insured against.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise the force of those arguments and propose, therefore, to ensure that relief is available where liability is to the employer, both for liability insurance policies to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0754">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>441</span>
cover that risk and for uninsured liabilities relating to the director's or employee's work. As my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham implied, the proposal would be welcomed by directors or employees who have liability insurance policies which provide indemnity for liability to their employers. I commend the Government amendment to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The good news ends as we turn to the other proposals. Amendment No. 138 would allow a director or employee to have relief for expenditure on liability insurance or uninsured liabilities against income from the employment not only in the tax year in which the payment is made but, as my hon. Friend explained, against income from employment in past and future years without any time limit. It is not clear exactly in what order the relief would be given, but it might be given against income from other employments. I do not agree with the amendment's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new relief introduced by clause 79 follows the well-established principle in schedule E of giving relief only for employees' expenses incurred out of their income in the relevant employment in the tax year in which those expenses are incurred. Expenditure on uninsured liabilities met by the employee not the employer could exceed the income from employment in any given year. However, such cases are likely to be rare. The Inland Revenue's consultative document, published last May, requested examples of where employees had met out of their own pockets, uninsured liabilities arising from their work without being reimbursed by their employer. Only one such example was given and, in that case, it was not clear whether the employee's expenditure had amounted to more than the employment income in the year of the expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 80 proposes to go further by allowing relief to be given against the former employee's total income and capital gains. However, that would occur in the exceptional circumstances where expenses occur after employment has ceased and, therefore, there is no longer any income from the employment against which to set the relief. That accounts for the distinction between the provisions in clause 80 and clause 79. Clause 80—rightly, in my opinion—does not propose to give relief backwards or forwards against past or future income and gains. It gives relief against income and gains in the year in which the payment is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, to give relief against an employee's income from employment in past and future years would add great administrative complexity to what is intended to be a relatively straightforward relief. If, as my hon. Friend proposed, relief were to be given backwards, it would be necessary to re-open assessments for previous years which would otherwise have become filed. It would also add to legislative complexity as another provision would be needed to give relief against assessments for previous years. The amendment would also place no time limit on the number of years against which relief could be given for past or future years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to say that, as drafted, the amendment does not set out the order of priority against which the relief would be given—for example, whether past years would have priority over future years and whether the immediately preceding year would have priority over the year before that. There is also a risk that the amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>442</span>
might allow relief to be given not only against the income from the relevant employment but against any other income from other employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend may have detected that we are not wildly enthusiastic about his proposal. I do not think that we should go beyond the general principle by giving relief against income from the employment in past and future years in what are likely to be exceptional circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully accept the deficiencies of the amendment, which my right hon. Friend has pointed out. However, the carrying of the tax deduction into previous and future years could be restricted to one year forward and one year back—or, as is more likely, one year back and one year forward. The director of a small company in particular may have no income in some years and a fluctuating income in others because that income may be related to company profits. That would especially apply in the case of a director of a closed company where the director's income would be critically dependent on that company's profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I understand my right hon. Friend's point, the problem in such a company is that it would need to pay the director in that year a sum equal to the insurance premium to allow the director to take the tax deduction. However, to do that the company would need to increase its tax loss in that year. The reason for being unable to pay the director any income would have been that the company was trading at a loss at that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend still has to deal with the issue of principle on which resistance to the amendment rests. The basic schedule E principle is that expenses can be offset against employment only for the year in question. Although the technical problems could be overcome, my hon. Friend's amendment would be unjust to the schedule E principle.

Amendment No. 140 would allow expenditure on a contract of insurance to qualify for the new relief, even if the insurance covered risks that were outside the intended scope of the new relief. I take it from what my hon. Friend said that in those cases he would argue that only the proportion of the premium relating to risks within the scope of the new relief should be deductible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I cannot advise the Committee to accept the amendment, which would complicate the operation of the new relief for indemnity insurance. The Committee will recall that I said that the purpose of the proposals is to relieve liabilities arising from acts or omissions of a director or employee in the course of employment. The amendment would extend the scope of the new relief on indemnity insurance to insurance policies which cover risks outside the scope of the new relief. The proposition is that an employee should be able to obtain a deduction for the proportion of the premium relating to the risks that are within the scope of the relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that some liability insurance policies cover risks that are outside the terms of the new relief. They cover expenses that may be incurred but are unrelated to the act or omission of the employee—for example, private household insurance. A provision that allows a tax deduction for only part of the premium is a recipe for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0755">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>443</span>
complexity. That is why I believe that, on balance, it is right to confine new relief to policies covering only those risks that are within the scope of the new relief. That is simpler in terms of legislation and avoids the need for employers, employees and the Revenue to agree on what proportion of a premium is eligible for the new relief. That is important with self-assessment on the horizon. It also follows the precedent set by the relief for private medical insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Limiting the new relief in that way should not prove unduly restrictive in practice. The definition of the risks that can be covered in the qualifying policy is quite wide. The Government are being pressed to simplify the tax code where possible and we should not make that task more difficult by adding new complexity. The amendment would do that and I urge the Committee to reject it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 143 reflects my hon. Friend's concern. The guiding principle in the clause is that its purpose is to give relief for all work-related liabilities, costs or expenses that can be lawfully insured against. I am sure that the Committee agrees that relief should not be available for costs arising from criminal convictions. Fines or penalties imposed on a director or employee for a criminal offence, which cannot legally be insured against on the grounds of public policy, will not be within the scope of the new relief. It would be wrong for the tax system to provide relief for criminal penalties imposed on a director or employee. The costs of defending a criminal case, whether the defence is successful or not, are lawfully insurable and are commonly covered by directors' and officers' liability insurance policies. I can give my hon. Friend the assurance that he wants that such costs that can be and are insured against will qualify for the new relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will agree that Government amendment No. 145 is prudent and welcome and that, on reflection, it will resist the amendments that are grouped with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I read with interest last night the debate that the Committee had on this issue last year. We are in favour of what the Government have now done and we support their amendment No. 145. We do not support the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Fulham because they would open up the possibility of abuse which would not be fair to all taxpayers. Government amendment No. 145 increases the availability of the tax relief and I want to know what that will cost. In the debate on the new clause last year, which led to the consultation exercise and clause 79, the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West estimated—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) please honour the Chair and the hon. Lady who is speaking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bournemouth, West estimated last year that the measure would cost £2 million to £5 million. The Minister did not correct that. Indeed, he was asked a specific question by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling), but he did not respond. The Government are now saying that the change will cost £40 million a year. That is a big difference. Perhaps what was envisaged last year has been extended more than was anticipated and I am worried about what that will cost the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>444</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady really suggesting that the Government should be discouraging people from taking out D and O liability insurance? That insurance was clearly recommended by various committees such as the Cadbury committee, which examined corporate governance. It is in the interests of shareholders in companies that directors should be covered by D and O liability insurance. The hon. Lady is attacking the spirit of the sensible change rightly introduced by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that the hon. Gentleman would listen more carefully. The change was argued for strenuously last year, but the basis of that argument and the remit of the consultation was narrow. I thought that it was our job to scrutinise the Executive. I want to examine what the Government have learnt from the consultation exercise that has led to the estimate of £40 million for next year. We need to be assured that that cost will meet the Committee's original requirements when it asked the Government to introduce legislation this year, and also that the measure is not being extended beyond that. As I have said, that is why we will not support the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Fulham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are still worried that the relief applies to all officers and directors. As the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West said last year, that can include a wide range of people, including caretakers. I know of one or two caretakers who some people were keen to take to court, but they were in the public sector. They would not have been affected by the Bill because they were automatically covered. That would not have been liable for taxation. However, the change is important for many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we reach the stand part debate, I will probably ask more questions about who will be affected by the measure. Quangos and public-private partnerships involve non-executive directors. The Minister was not clear last year whether they would be affected by the provisions. Have the Government now decided that they will be, and is that one of the reasons why the cost is higher? We generally favour what the Government are trying to do, but I am worried by the sudden rise in the estimated cost. I want to know what is being covered in that cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warwickshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary knows that we do not oppose the measure in principle. However, when he is explaining the new cost, will he also estimate the benefit that it will bring to directors? It is, of course, important to encourage directors—especially directors of small companies—to be properly insured. How much better off will a director, such as Mr. Cedric Brown, be as a result of the change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Ms Armstrong) was right—the figure is £40 million a year. The estimate quoted in last year's debate related to a narrower exemption. The debate last year was about an exemption from the benefit-in-kind paid by employers. The cost of £40 million relates to the wider exemption proposed in the clause, which provides relief for insured and uninsured liabilities met both by the employer and by the employees. If the hon. Lady rereads last year's debate, she will discover that the principle of what we are doing was supported by her hon. Friends.

When we consulted, strong support came from the 92 bodies that replied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North (Mr. O'Brien) is that we live in an increasingly litigious world—something that we have, perhaps, imported from America. More and more people are exposed to legal action. When that relates to their work, it is right that the cost should be a tax-deductible expense. We do not disagree on the principle. I do not intend to be drawn into the individual cases quoted by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obviously saddened that my right hon.

I did not have the good fortune to be a member of the Standing Committee last year and to hear the words of wisdom spoken in the debate. However, like the hon. Member for Durham, North-West, I, too, have read what was said and there was clearly a strong consensus in favour of change. I must commend my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West, who espoused the cause initially. I also commend the Government for introducing the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been advised—I hope that my right hon. Friend will be able to help me by confirming whether that advice was correct—that group policies will not qualify for tax relief. The amendment is designed to deal with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his lucid explanation of the intention of his amendment. While I accept that the point put by my hon. Friend has some merit, I cannot recommend that the Committee should accept the principle behind it. In any case, the amendment as drafted would not have the desired effect. Let me return to the principle behind our lack of enthusiasm for the amendment, which relates to an argument that I used when dealing with my hon. Friend's amendments in our most recent series of debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend knows, clause 79 gives relief for directors' and employees' expenditure on liability insurance and uninsured liabilities relating to their work. It does so by giving relief against the income from the relevant employment. That is in line with the focus of the clause, which looks at the acts or omissions of the individual relating to the particular employment, and the liabilities which arise from those acts or omissions. It is also in line with the general tax principle of giving relief
	<span class='label label-info column'>446</span>
only for directors' or employees' expenses incurred out of their income from the relevant employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend would breach that general principle. It would allow the director or employee of one company in a group to set expenditure on liability insurance or uninsured liabilities against income from another company in that group. It is of course conceivable that an individual holding different appointments with different companies in a group could incur expenditure on uninsured liabilities relating to one particular appointment, where the expenditure amounted to more than the income from that appointment, or where there was no remuneration from that appointment. However, if the company met the costs, any tax charge on the director or employee would be cancelled by the relief introduced by the clause. Similarly, if the individual took out insurance, relief for the premiums would be available under the clause against the income from that particular employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one analyses the risks about which my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield is concerned, an individual could be left with a liability which is both uninsured and unreimbursed by his employer and which exceeds the income from the appointment with any company in the group. I do not think that we should go beyond the general principle that I have enunciated and give relief against the income from the other companies in the group in what would be very exceptional circumstances. To do so would have the additional disadvantage of complicating the leglisation. I invite my hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment, if he sees fit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last thing of which I would want to be accused is trying to complicate the legislation. I think what will happen in practice is that, now that this relief is available, insurers will try to ensure that the policies they write fall within the relief provisions. I am happy to accept my right hon. Friend's comments, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 112, in page 84, line 6, leave out "1995-96" and insert "1994–95".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate on this matter took place toward the end of March last year. At that time my right hon. Friend who is now the Secretary of State for National Heritage said that, in principle, the Government accepted the proposal advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West. Therefore, I consider it reasonable to suggest that the change should take place from approximately that date. If the amendment is accepted, the date would be 6 April 1994—a few days after the debate took place. I am advised that some outstanding cases are currently being disputed with the Revenue, and it is reasonable to suggest that the relief should be backdated to the time when the debate took place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Legg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and myself. Like my hon. Friend, I am concerned about outstanding cases. There has been a long debate on the issue—it probably started in 1990, when lobbying commenced—and a large number of cases are causing problems for taxpayers and their advisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0757">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>447</span>
Yesterday I received a fax from a leading firm of chartered accountants about a case with which they are currently dealing. I shall read brief extracts from the fax. The partner writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My client … has held a Directors' and Officers' Liability Insurance (D&O) policy"—</p></blockquote>
for a number of years. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When the publicity regarding the tax implications of making such payments arose, we contacted the Inland Revenue and made an offer to pay over tax and national insurance contributions on a grossed up basis in respect of 10 per cent. of the appropriate premiums paid. Despite initial agreement to this, the Inspector of Taxes subsequently demanded tax/NIC in respect of 90 per cent. of the premiums … even though my client's policy was similar to that held by many companies where the Inland Revenue have demanded tax/NIC in respect of only 10 per cent. of the premiums."</p></blockquote>
That demonstrates that there are a number of cases where the Inland Revenue currently has considerable discretion and taxpayers are involved in lengthy correspondence, trying to mitigate their liabilities. The Government have decided that it is right to change tax legislation, and equitable so to do, it should therefore be acceptable either to make the amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield or to issue an extra-statutory concession, allowing cases that are currently underway to be settled in accordance with the new legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. When the Committee discussed this issue last year, it was clear that the overwhelming majority of members of the Committee approved of the principle that is now enshrined in clause 79. It was really only as a result of the wish of my right hon. Friend the then Financial Secretary to consult more widely on the detail of the clause and to refine the clause that I had proposed into a more comprehensive measure—such as the one before us now—that the measure was not agreed by last year's Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that it was clearly the will of the Committee that the change should be made, and given that it is a wholly relieving measure, and there is no conflict in making it retrospective, it is reasonable to make it effective from the beginning of the tax year. If we do not do that, even after today's deliberations, individuals will remain liable until the end of the current tax year for taxation on matters for which, we all agree, they should not be liable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I have remained silent during the debate, but I should put on record, that before I came to this House, I was a beneficiary of directors' and officers' liability insurance and, therefore I have an interest in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was appropriate to hear from my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West, who is the father of this clause. His offspring has grown somewhat during the past 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Mr. Legg) about existing cases. Of course, I should like to see the details of the case to which my hon. Friend referred. In seeking the tax for 1994–95 and earlier, the Inland Revenue will examine the facts in each case and be mindful of the principles enshrined in the taxpayers charter when
	<span class='label label-info column'>448</span>
deciding whether to pursue tax on indemnity insurance and work-related uninsured liabilities for past years. In accordance with the taxpayers charter, such tax will not be pursued in most cases where the amount of tax involved is small. However, where significant amounts of tax are at stake, the Inland Revenue will consider collecting it, where it would be reasonable and practical so to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend came up with an ingenious argument for backdating, saying that because the debate took place a year ago, the relief should be backdated to that time. That would be retrospective legislation because the measures are only now before the House. When changes are made to the tax system, the normal practice is for them to apply prospectively, from a date on or after Budget day. That general practice applies whether the changes involve new or increased tax liabilities or, as in this case, a new relief. It also applies broadly when there has been earlier consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Retrospective action may be justified in exceptional cases, with the aim of preventing avoidance or enabling an unintended effect of the law to be put right for the past. However, the general presumption against retrospective taxation legislation is sound, as it provides taxpayers with relative certainty on how their income for a particular year or from a particular transaction will be treated. With some regret, therefore, I have to recommend that the Committee rejects the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite an important matter is at stake because the Treasury seems to be building up a new philosophy on retrospection. We have to distinguish carefully between relieving provisions, which result in less tax payable, and measures which introduce new taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, the debate has always centred on the extent to which retrospective legislation was acceptable when new tax burdens were being introduced, but, not for the first time during our sittings, Treasury Ministers are now expressing concern about retrospection for relieving provisions. That is a new approach. I do not understand how any reasonable person can object to relieving provisions, however far back they go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already pointed out that one clause, which was not even discussed in Committee, dealing with VAT in a consolidation Act last year said mistakenly that the legislation shall be deemed always to have had effect. Nobody took exception because the complexity of tax legislation means that we frequently pass such measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate relating to my amendment, which took place on 24 March 1994, my right hon. Friend the previous Financial Secretary made it clear that the principle was accepted, and in May a consultative document was published setting out the proposals. I do not wish to go to the stake on this issue—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] If my hon. Friends will join me in supporting the amendment, I might reconsider my position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rapidly declare a potential interest in that I may be a beneficiary of such a policy on directors' liability insurance. Last year, my right hon. Friend the then Financial Secretary had an amazing conversion on this issue over the dinner hour. My clear impression was that he wanted to be incredibly helpful from that point in time and that tax year. If we do not

	<span class='label label-info column'>449</span>
establish the helpfulness that the then Financial Secretary wished for after his amazing dinner hour conversion, we shall not reflect the true spirit of what he wanted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether we could have a short suspension for elevenses so that my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary could have some coffee or some kind of refreshment and give the matter some more thought. There are two important issues involved—first, the question of when the relief should start, and secondly, my more general point about retrospection. I propose that the Committee be adjourned for 15 minutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to try to help the Committee. I suggest to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that I might be prepared to consider his suggestion when we have heard the Financial Secretary's response. I would not be prepared to grant a suspension for 15 minutes. It is within my authority to grant a suspension for a modest period, but it might be for the convenience of the Committee to hear the Financial Secretary first. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield might then consider the matter against and perhaps put his request to me later, if he so wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very disappointed by my right hon. Friend's responses. His suggestion that the Inland Revenue would overlook small matters which were de minimis, but would still pursue tax charges on larger liabilities, worries me very much, especially in relation to uninsured liabilities. A director may be faced with having to pay very large sums in respect of uninsured liabilities and those payments, if met by his company, would then be deemed to be income in his hands taxable at his highest marginal rate, which seems to me to be totally unacceptable. I cannot believe that it would be right for us to allow such a situation to continue any longer than is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have preferred it if my right hon. Friend had been able to say that the Revenue would overlook the liabilities dating from the time of last year's debate, but he has clearly said that large liabilities will be pursued. In my view that makes the inequity even worse and I am not inclined to let the matter rest as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can we find out whether some people have already met their liabilities and what sort of sums are currently being pursued by the Revenue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary comment further on the point raised by Conservative Members about the desirability of retrospective tax reliefs? I have a more cautious approach to that matter than the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. If people made arrangements last year on the basis of the existing tax regime, it would be unfair to make retrospective changes to that regime because the decisions made a year ago were made in good faith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that, in many cases, the directors or officers involved did not make any allowance for taxation because a letter arrived out of the blue for the company secretary from the Inland Revenue saying that it proposed to tax that insurance, which people had increasingly been taking out over the years, and any
	<span class='label label-info column'>450</span>
benefits which might arise from insurance or from the settlement of legal cases involving directors. Nobody expected that or made any plans for it and directors' remuneration was not raised to allow for it, so many directors did not have the income to pay the additional amount. We are dealing with exceptional circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but Conservative Members were making a point about the general desirability of retrospective tax reliefs. That is what I am querying and I would like the Financial Secretary to comment on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the benefits of the Jopling reforms is that this Committee no longer has a break for dinner during which Ministers can be worked over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee can sit after dinner if it wishes so to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me rephrase what I said. There have been no dinner breaks over which my hon. Friends can persuade Ministers that changes should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Timms), people may have made payments in the circumstances that he has described, but the tax position will not be determined until after the year has ended. We are concerned with the tax treatment of payments not the incidence of when they are paid. It would cost about £40 million to backdate the measure by a year. I put that on the table for my hon. Friends to reflect on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield referred to a VAT change and said that we had retrospectively changed our policy. However, as I said in my opening remarks, exceptionally we introduced retrospective action to enable an unintended effect of the law to be put right for the past. That applies to the VAT change but not to this one, which has no unintended effect. It is a policy change, which was not announced a year ago—which was when the Government decided to examine that matter and began to consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reluctant to agree to the amendment's proposal to backdate the measure to April last year. Without commitment, I would like to explore a suggestion made by my hon. Friends the Members for Milton Keynes, South-West and for Bournemouth, West, that there might be another way—perhaps by extra-statutory concession—to examine further this aspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way. I am worried by that alleged figure of £40 million. When the previous Financial Secretary introduced the measure last year, he said it would have a minor effect, raising a few million pounds. The figure £40 million has suddently emerged this year, as a result of a broadening of the operation of clause's provisions. We have that estimate of £40 million but, as far as I am aware, no estimate of the amount each director would have to pay. Will genuine directors, who have been made directors during the year—perhaps people with no financial resources who have suddenly been appointed to directorship positions—suddenly be faced with tax bills of £5,000, £10,000, £15,000 or £20,000 as a result of this measure? We need clarification about the effect and impact of the measure in the past year. I recall that the

We are not confronting—as my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to keep intervening, but it would be a new bill. I accept that past legislation suggested a tax liability. However, in the past, the Revenue never tried to impose that liability. It was never claimed. For many years, people became company directors in blissful ignorance of any such liability. Then out of the blue, letters arrived at many companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly surprised to hear that the Inland Revenue has not collected taxes that are due to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify the contents of the fax, which relates to insurance premiums, not the legal costs involved in the case where the Revenue pursues a company for tax and uses wide discretion to assess that tax in respect of premiums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall add to what my hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) said by saying that my understanding was that the Revenue estimated the tax liability in respect of insurance premiums to be of the order of £5 million a year. If that is the case, that means that the liabilities that it plans to assess for directors who have defended such cases and have had their legal costs reimbursed will be around £35 million—a substantial figure for them to have to bear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove the six-year restriction in the clause relating to the period in which deductions have to be made. The six-year period should be removed because such a claim is subject to the legal process, and the vagaries of the legal process may well extend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0760">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>453</span>
considerably beyond the six-year period. It is not unusual for claims to arise many years after the relevant director or officer has retired. The six-year period seems to be unduly short, and I urge my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to consider either removing the restriction altogether or extending it to a period that better reflects the slow processes of justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us see what difficulties we shall have with this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall put the amendment in its context. Clause 80 will extend the new tax relief in clause 79 to former directors or employees who, after their employment has ceased, continue to pay for liability insurance or meet uninsured liabilities relating to their work. It thus recognises that some former directors or employees continue to pay for liability insurance for some time after their employment has ceased—so called run-off insurance. Indeed, some are required to do so by their professional associations—for example, architects. Similarly, the clause recognises that some former directors or employees might have to face uninsured liabilities relating to their former employment some time after the employment has ceased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The six-year time limit we propose for the new relief is, we feel, about right. Giving relief for up to six years after the end of the tax year in which the employment ceased fits the general time limit for bringing claims under the statue of limitations, which applies to many of the liabilities arising from the work carried out by former directors or employees. The six-year limit also broadly matches the time limit for relief for the former self-employed under clause 78—the limit there is seven years after the date when the trade or profession ceased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To have no time limit whatsoever would be wrong. It would also mean that former directors or employees would be treated more generously than the former self-employed. The six-year limit puts the former employee and the former self-employed on a broadly equal footing. Moreover, there would be practical difficulties in operating a relief in which a claim was made perhaps 10 or 15 years after the employment had ceased. In order to check the validity of a claim, the Inland Revenue would have to retrieve data regarding the employment which had ceased many years before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that, for uninsured liabilities, there may be exceptional cases where an action takes a long time to be settled, or the liability a long time to be determined, and the payment of the uninsured liability is therefore outside the six-year time limit. However, we have to draw a line somewhere, and six years is in our view a reasonable period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think my hon. friend the Member for Fulham will agree that the number of cases where payment of an uninsured liability by a former director or employee falls within the terms of this new relief, but outside the six-year time limit, are likely to be pretty rare. One could argue that that is an argument for removing the six-year time limit. I suggest to my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham that we keep the matter under review—it is, after all, an entirely new tax relief. If it can be shown, after the relief has been operating for one year, that there are, or are likely to be, cases where a six-year period would operate harshly, we shall consider the time limit again in time for
	<span class='label label-info column'>454</span>
next year's Finance Bill. On that basis, I invite my hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. Keeping the matter under review is probably the right way to handle it. I should add, however, that although the statute of limitations may apply to claims in this country, claims frequently arise overseas as well. That may create different problems, as we have seen frequently with United States law, where claims can arise many years later, and may cause problems. However, in view of the assurance from my right hon. Friend, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that I can speak briefly to my amendment. It overlaps with amendment No. 112, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beasonsfield, and to which I added my name. Clauses 79 and 80 cover the same subjects. One deals with current officers and the other deals with former officers. The amendment will help to ensure that there is consistency between the two clauses. I shall not repeat all the arguments that were made when we discussed clause 79, but they apply to clause 80 as well. I am sure that my right hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the underlying objective of the clause, which is essentially deregulatory. At present, if a person goes away on business and incurs expenses that are not wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred for the purposes of the business, that person will be taxed on the expenses. We all know from trips away—the law applies as much to Members of Parliament as to anyone else—that one incurs expenses that one would not otherwise have incurred. The obvious example is a telephone call home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that such an intervention is at all helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that commonsense reveals the sort of expenses that I have in mind. A telephone call home is an obvious example. If someone were to go abroad for a lengthy trip, he would inevitably incur the cost of laundry. Small sums are involved: £5 for domestic trips and £10 for international business trips. The £5 limit is perfectly reasonable, but I am not sure about the £10 limit—perhaps a £20 limit would be more reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In connection with benefits in kind, inspectors tend to discuss matters with individual taxpayers, and they reach agreements individually about what is reasonable. In some cases, it may already be—I do not have such information to hand—that inspectors are prepared to ignore small expenditures. The great thing about the clause is that it will introduce an element of certainty, which is a welcome simplification. Hon. Members will have seen what the Institute of Taxation and the Law Society said on the matter, so I shall not repeat their remarks. We should go for a slightly higher figure for overseas business trips.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, especially because the £10 limit for overseas travel seems to be somewhat low. In many parts of the world, telephone charges are so heavily weighted by hotels that £10 does not buy a call to the United Kingdom. Indeed, I had the good fortune to be part of a parliamentary delegation to the Lebanon just after the new year and telephone charges there were such that £10 would have been insufficient even to say hello to my 13-year-old daughter. I would, therefore, urge my right hon. Friend to reconsider the £10 limit in light of the expenses that are realistically incurred during overseas travel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to oppose both the clause and the amendments to it. I wonder why the Government have seen fit to grant tax relief to those who need it least. I reiterate what I said about other clauses; the Prime Minister has said that it is the business of Government to deal with inequality. Clauses, such as this, which give tax relief to those who least need it, do little to tackle that central business of Government—to attack inequality. This exemption will be considered to be the creation of a new tax loophole for business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Lady gets too self-righteous and puffed up, will she consider that most people who travel on business abroad are generating exports for the country and trying to encourage our economy?

enjoyment but are due to the fact they have to suffer considerable hardship in many parts of the world where expenses are high.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have absolutely no doubt that people who travel abroad add to the wealth of the nation, as do shift workers, but if shift workers are suddenly expected to change shift in their current place of work, they do not receive tax relief for any telephone calls they make to their 13-year-old children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If clause 81 is agreed to, it will require vigilance and, therefore, expenditure by the Inland Revenue to monitor what people include as incidental expenses—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no idea how much is spent by the Inland Revenue in dealing with such matters, but I should have thought that much will be spent in staff time in vigilantly ensuring that there is no evasion—as opposed to avoidance—as a result of the clause. The clause could lead to evasion and would, therefore, require Inland Revenue officers to be vigilant in monitoring all claims that are submitted. I would describe the clause as the thin end of the wedge, which might lead to the Government's tabling other similar amendments next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw to the attention of the Committee a recent judgment on the tax treatment of allowances paid to journalists to subsidise their purchase of newspapers and magazines. There were two cases in the House of Lords last year: Smith 	<i>v</i> Abbott and Fitzpatrick 	<i>v</i> Commissioners of the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In both cases, it was decided that the allowances were taxable as part of the journalists' income and could not be treated as expenses incurred as part of their employment. In both cases, the journalists were employees of a newspaper company and were charged income tax under schedule E on moneys wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of employment. Although it is clear that newspaper employers expect their employees to read widely, it was ruled that, in reading newspapers bought in the employees' spare time and usually read at home, journalists were simply preparing themselves to perform their duties more effectively and, as such, the payment that they received to fund that activity did not fall within the strict provisions of the Taxes Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In several other professions, employees incur similar costs and the courts have interpreted those costs as being wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred for employment, but those conditions are interpreted restrictively. If we agree to this clause relating to expenses abroad, there is no logical reason why tax relief should not be extended to incidental expenditure incurred at home by employees in other circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some expenditure incurred incidentally away from home is not necessarily expenditure that one would not have incurred at home. Newspapers are one such example. One reads a newspaper whether one is at home or away from home. Why should that expense attract tax exemption if one is away when it would not at home?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall get the Committee procedure right in the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments to clause 81 indicate the absurdity of the clause. It would be very difficult to be fair, even if an amount were allowed for incidental expenses. Clearly, it would cost more to ring home from abroad. How could a limit be established in tax terms which would be fair to people at home and to those abroad? The longer someone is away, the more likely it is that expenses will be incurred in respect of laundry and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the Financial Secretary that the clause—I am sure that he has no self-interest in it—will open a loophole that will be extended over time. It will be very difficult to ensure that the provision is honestly used by employees travelling abroad, and impossible—as we see from the amendments—to ensure that it is fair to everyone whenever they travel, wherever they travel and for however long they are away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of those clauses which, on first reading, seem innocent, sensible and intended to provide clarification. But the more one listens to the debate and considers the provision, the more one realises the impact that it will have on our constituents, especially in constituencies such as mine where there are many seafarers. The majority of seafarers in my constituency travel between Dover and Calais and do not have to stay overnight, even if there is a problem or delay, but some work not on the Dover-Calais route but on long-haul routes elsewhere in the world. I should be interested in any comments that my right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I suggest that the Committee looks at the amendment paper? We are discussing an amendment which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"leave out '£10' and insert '£20'."</p></blockquote>
We seem now to be having almost a clause stand part debate. If it is the Committee's wish that we debate the
	<span class='label label-info column'>458</span>
clause in general on this limited amendment, I shall not permit a clause stand part debate later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Winterton. I had intended to concentrate on the £10 and £20. My experience of the issue concerns my father, who is now retired but who, for some 20 years, battled for Britain in a major international company trying to increase this country's revenue. He travelled widely and frequently, often 15 or 20 times a year, for periods ranging from three days to 15 or 20 days. His telephone calls from abroad were welcomed by the family, especially my mother, but cost—as the hon. Member for Fulham said—a considerable amount of money. If the Inland Revenue is proposing that people in a similar position should keep detailed records of telephone calls, including a record of their purpose and the exact proportion of the cost that was related to business and domestic use, massive amounts of paperwork will result. My father would telephone from abroad and sometimes ask my mother to telephone the office in the morning to relay a message. Do we want business men instructing their wives on how much time they should spend on a telephone call to the office on business and how much on personal matters?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other anxiety concerns the position of Members of Parliament and the way in which we receive moneys for going abroad. A year ago, I went on a visit related to social security matters—my first and only trip abroad as a Member of Parliament. I was surprised to be given a cash sum when we arrived at the embassy. That cash sum was to be used in a fairly broad way. We are legislating for the mass of the people, when we enjoy a privilege that is not available to those people. Our privilege in receiving that cash sum and allocating it for individual expenses as we saw fit applies throughout the civil service. When a civil servant stays overnight, he can claim a lump-sum allowance related to hotel charges and meal costs, but if the expenses incurred are lower than that allowance, he is allowed to keep the difference. No attempt is made through the tax system to tax that cash difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far from the measure being one in which the private sector will find a loophole, it is one in which we are treating the private sector in a different way from that in which we treat the public sector and Members of Parliament. The clause is fraught with danger in terms of our own position. Every member of the Committee probably has an interest in the clause, which should be declared.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

to £20. We are not convinced by the arguments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, but I want to ask the Minister some questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that hon. Members should be concerned about laundry. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) has argued elsewhere for increased allowances for disabled people to cover laundry and so on. That argument did not find much favour on the Government Benches, so I am pleased that we are now finding greater consensus on matters that should be considered when thinking about our constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister whether I have understood correctly that, because the relief is tightly drawn—we approve of that—if the maximum allowed is exceeded, the whole amount spent, and not simply the amount up to £10 or £20 will be taxable. We want clarification of that on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to ask the Minister what happens now? While there is a tax liability, it is not clear whether the Revenue is able to secure sums at the moment and there is certainly little indication of how much the Revenue is able to take in at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

One of the purposes of the clause, as I understand it, is to make it easier for employers to be clear with the Revenue as to what the liability is and what the overall position is. I should like some clarity on what the Revenue currently takes in and what the difference would be if it were able to administer this matter effectively. It is always difficult to work out the exact tax liability in this area and I suspect that, in many cases, both sides give up because the issue becomes too complicated. It is important that the House should give people the message that they will be liable to pay tax on certain expenses and that living abroad will not exempt them from those liabilities.

I, too, have constituents who work abroad—mostly in the construction industry in Germany or other European Union countries—because they are not able to get jobs in the north-east. Others work on oil rigs in the North sea. Those constituents have expenses, of course, but I am always straight with them when they come to see me and I tell them that they should not expect to be treated better than other constituents. The fact that they are able to work at all is seen as a great benefit and I do not want to discourage them from taking jobs abroad, but they should not be recompensed unfairly.

I am pleased that there has been no attempt to change the relevant figure for the United Kingdom. Everyone makes telephone calls as a matter of course these days. Whether or not they work away from home, many people make telephone calls simply to check up on everyday matters during a normal day, as my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) said, so it is difficult to argue for special, over-generous treatment for people who are away from home. Perhaps we sound a little stingy, but such sums mount up and we are anxious that the relief should not be too wide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the provision apply to those in the public sector such as Ministers, who frequently have to be away from home and travel abroad? Expenses incurred by Ministers while away from home have come under scrutiny recently. Does the measure have anything to do with the
	<span class='label label-info column'>460</span>
questions that have been raised in the public domain about what public servants get up to? Are we having to formalise arrangements because of past abuses?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public are rightly fed up with people in positions of enormous privilege abusing that privilege and trying to make money for themselves. We are clearly very privileged in being able to serve the public in our positions and many members of the public have far fewer resources than many of us. We have to be careful not to appear to be making life easier for those who are already in a privileged position. Is this what the Government had in mind when giving evidence to the Nolan Committee on proper standards for those in public life?

The clause raises many interesting issues, but you have made it clear that you will not allow us to pursue most of them, Mr. Winterton, so I shall not test your generosity as a Chairman.

Even if there were a case for the measure, I would argue strongly that now is not the time for it. The hon. Members for Dover and for Beaconsfield have said that there is a case for it, but that is arguable and I believe that there is not. I shall explain why in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a time when we are debating a Finance Bill which makes drastic cuts in allowances across the spectrum, the measure cannot be justified. I wish to make that point as strongly as possible. The hon. Member for Dover is right in saying that we have to take into account the effect of particular measures on our constituents and the way in which they will view such measures. I am sure that I do not have to elaborate too much for hon. Members to recognise what impression our constituents will have of such a tax relief, concession or benefit—I shall use the word "benefit"—when allowances across the board are being squeezed. I repeat that, if ever there were a case for the measure, which I doubt, now is not the time for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman may be labouring under a misapprehension. There is nothing new about the idea. The Law Society said in its submission:
	<br><blockquote><p>"some inspectors have agreed practices under which reasonable incidental expenses of this kind are not sought to be taxed".</p></blockquote>
The Institute of Taxation has made the same point. All that the Government propose, as I understand it, is to simplify matters by naming an amount in each case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not use the word "new"; the hon. Member for Beaconsfield used it. I have not described the measure as new. I have described it as a benefit which, if the amendment is not accepted, will cost the Exchequer £20 million. That assessment is beyond dispute. My point is that, if £20 million is available, I can think of thousands of better ways of using it.

I confess openly and without reservation that I am not a business person, but I feel that some of the comments that have been made today need to be challenged, because they push the bounds of credibility to breaking point. The hon. Member for Fulham said that people go abroad to generate business, which is understandable and is doubtless the case. But do they really depend on claiming for newspapers and telephone calls to generate that business? The idea that someone from GEC in Alstom, who goes to China to sell a power station or a generator, will say, "Hang on a second. I've got to make sure I can claim back the telephone call", defies logic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not worth responding to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield may be right. The hon. Gentleman's statement is astonishing. Is he seriously suggesting that because an employee of GEC goes to China, that employee is a beneficiary in the contract or is necessarily highly paid? The employee might be a lowly paid engineer who needs to keep in contact with his or her family because otherwise his marriage might break down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concede a minor part of that argument. I am glad that the hon. Member for Fulham did respond, even though some of his hon. Friends suggested that he should not. I agree that an argument can be made to justify a small part of what we have discussed fitting into that category, but I think that the majority does not. Arguments can be used to suggest different calculations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all made phone calls from hotels when we are abroad. Hotels are in the business of making quite a bit of money out of such calls. Some people describe them as a rip-off—I have no doubt that that is the case; It is impossible to justify. However, if we did what Conservative Members suggest we would be subsidising the excesses of unjustified telephone charges in hotels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of overnight stays is also raised by the amendment. Will the Financial Secretary confirm that if someone is away for one day, he does not qualify, but if he is away for two days—overnight—he does? There is that distinction in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if there is an argument for the proposal—I doubt whether there is—it is the wrong time to introduce it. The arguments to substantiate the need for the clause and to support the amendment are weak to say the least and questionable at best.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members have made heavy weather of this proposal. We are introducing a simple, deregulatory measure. Everyone is asking us to simplify and streamline the tax system. To portray that as a major redistribution of wealth and a great affront to social justice is rubbish. The argument was put in context by my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham who said that it is perfectly possible that the modest reliefs proposed
	<span class='label label-info column'>462</span>
may not cover the cost of a telephone call home from Beirut. The gist of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South's argument was that some hotels abroad charge high tariffs, we should boycott them and not ring home. He said that we should not subsidise high telephone charges abroad through our tax system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman is going to tell us that he is ashamed of saying that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When it comes to which hon. Members should be ashamed, I think that the Government corner the market. I did not suggest, nor did I say, that we should boycott telephone calls from hotels that are ripping people off by excessive charges. I want to put the record straight on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me get back on course and put the matter in perspective before I address the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. The clause exempts payments by employers for employees' personal incidental expenses when they stay away from home overnight on business. The exemption applies to payments of up to £5 a night for stays in the United Kingdom—I was interested to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield say that that was about right—and £10 a night for stays outside the UK, about which he and several of our hon. Friends had reservations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax system does not generally give relief for items of personal expenditure. But this is a deregulatory measure. Employers often pay for employees' personal incidental expenses when they stay away from home overnight on business. The most common expenses are newspapers, telephone calls home and laundry. The payments by employers are taxable because the expenses rules for employees give relief only for expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Representatives of employers have argued strongly that the work involved in keeping track of and reporting those relatively small items is not justified by the sums involved and the tax at stake. We have listened to those representations carefully. The exemption—though relatively minor in itself—shows that the Government take seriously the need to reduce burdens on business where possible. That is particularly important with the impending introduction of self-assessment which will mean additional costs for some employers. The measure should go some way in offsetting those costs for employers who pay for their employees' overnight expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exemption covers all ways in which an employer may meet employees' personal incidental expenses—by an allowance for those expenses, by reimbursing actual expenditure, by providing vouchers or credit cards or by paying the hotel bill direct. The exemption also covers the wide variety of incidental expenses which employers may pay for when employees are away from home on business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If employers pay for amounts over the limits—the point raised by the hon. Member for Durham, North-West—the whole amount becomes taxable. For employers who take
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0765">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>463</span>
advantage of the new exemption and pay up to the limits, the deregulatory savings will be clear. If they go over the top, they are back where they are now—no worse off. If they stay within the limits, they will no longer need to examine hotel bills to extract information solely for tax purposes; nor will they need to make returns of the information to the Revenue. The Revenue will be issuing guidance to employers on the new exemption, which is a small but important deregulatory step. I hope that Opposition Members will pay no attention to what the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South said and will not be unhelpful by voting against the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some cases, dispensations are granted to employers if the inspector of taxes is satisfied that the expenses payments or benefits in kind are matched in full by a deduction for employees so that there is no net liability to tax. That is not the case for personal incidental expenses which, when paid for by the employer, are currently taxable in full. If some existing dispensations incorrectly include those payments, the Inland Revenue will ensure that the dispensations are amended when they are reviewed in the normal course of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Barking mentioned the Fitzpatrick case. The proposed exemption is a pragmatic measure to reduce employers' compliance costs. It covers much smaller sums than the allowances paid to journalists to buy newspapers. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West said, for many employees staying in hotels, the newspaper represents an additional cost over and above the cost of a newspaper delivered to his or her home. I hope that no one was suggesting that because the head of the household has gone away and will buy a newspaper in the hotel, he should cancel the delivery of the newspaper to his home so that his wife and children do not get the benefit of it. Most of us recognise that in those circumstances the newspaper will continue to be delivered to the home and will be paid for, and that the newspaper bought in the hotel is extra and would not otherwise have been bought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary said that where the Inland Revenue has negotiated a dispensation on incidental expenses, it should not have done so and will have to reconsider. Is that right? He is arguing that this deregulatory measure has been introduced because the amounts collected from individuals are so small that it is probably not worth putting the burden of collecting on businesses, and that collection would probably cost the Inland Revenue more than £20 million anyway. Is he now suggesting that the Inland Revenue goes back and starts negotiating with individuals with whom it has already entered agreements on incidental expenses—albeit perhaps wrongly, although at the time it was convenient so to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such dispensation will not need to be renegotiated once the clause is on the statute book, provided that they are below the limit. If they are above the limit they are taxable, and it is right that they should be taxed. This deregulatory measure will help in cases where, for whatever reason, employers are not reporting them. They will drop out of the system. If they do not drop out of the system, it is right that tax should be paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point raised by the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North, which partly concerned
	<span class='label label-info column'>464</span>
me, will not this deregulatory measure actually result in increased regulation? Do not large numbers of companies have travelling employees of different sorts who incur incidental expenses that may fall outside the criteria for normal travel expenses? Until now, those employees may not have been sought by the Revenue, trying to impose the full might of the tax system. If this measure is passed unamended, there will be a clear exemption up to the amount of £10—or, if the amendment is passed, £20—but the full might of the tax system will be imposed on amounts greater than that. That represents a massive increase in regulation, because any company with travelling employees will have to deal with far more bureaucracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not accept that argument. A minority of companies may be using the present system incorrectly. The onus is on the employer to report expenses. However, the majority of employers operate the system fairly, openly and honestly, and for such companies there will be an enormous deregulatory gain because they will no longer have to accommodate that system. That is why, in the consultations that have taken place, representatives of employers have welcomed our actions. That is the best answer I can give my hon. Friend the Member for Dover. He will be pleased to hear that his seafarers will benefit from the exemption, if they have at least one overnight stay away from home when travelling on business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share some of the concerns of the hon. Member for Dover. The Financial Secretary seems not to accept that incidental expenses for some companies are dealt with through the tax system, in the sense that the Inland Revenue accepts that the tax need not be paid. If we impose this new rule. Will the tax inspectors who deal with individual cases retain the ability to decide not to charge tax in certain cases? If all cases are covered by the new rule, that will cause substantial extra regulation, especially for companies which have a large number of employees who go abroad?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me help my hon. Friend the Member for Dover and the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North. The Inland Revenue plans to issue clear guidance to employers on how it is proposed the new regime will work. That will shed light on some of the issues raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the cliff edge—the fact that if one overpays slightly the whole amount becomes exposed—there are precedents for de minimus exemptions, for example, for small beneficial loans or for Christmas parties paid for by employers. It is not the first time that such exemptions have been allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Ministers are obliged to stay overnight in order to carry out their duties, I am advised that their Departments may pay an overnight subsistence allowance, which excludes personal incidental expenses. A separate payment for those items can be made and has been taxed in the past. Ministers have not been and will not be given reimbursement for vast personal incidental expenses. Their expenditure on newspapers, phone calls and so on will be covered under this measure in exactly the same way as anyone else's expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not fully understand that answer. When individuals—not just Ministers—are reimbursed a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0766">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>465</span>
daily rate for expenses, would that be taxed under the new arrangements or would it be necessary for the individual or the public servant to make a statement of how much of the allowance was spent on hotels and incidental expenses so that the residue could be taxed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what happens at the moment. Within the civil service, it is dealt with under the pay-as-you-earn system. The hotel bill is examined, the amount for accommodation, meals and personal incidental expenses are exempted and the balance is added to income on which tax is payable under the PAYE system. Under the new regime, if the amount is below the threshold it will drop out of the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, if someone in the public sector, whether a Minister, a Member of Parliament or a civil servant, receives a subsistence allowance of, for example, £100 for one night and the hotel bill is £60, leaving £40 for meals, incidentals and sundry expenses, he can do what he wants with that £40. He need not eat an expensive meal; he could eat a cheap meal. The balance can be used in any way he deems fit, which may be on a telephone call home, on a gift for someone who has provided hospitality or on a series of incidental expenses. It seems that people in the public sector, for whom a trade union or other body has negotiated a subsistence allowance, are treated differently from people in the private sector who do not have a trade union to negotiate for them and will end up paying tax in those circumstances. There seems to be a difference in the treatment of people in the public and private sectors. Should we recommend to all business men that they find a trade union to negotiate subsistence allowances so that they have a better deal on their incidental expenses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is broadening the debate from hotel expenses, which are paid by employers and which should be reported through the tax system to the general question of subsistence allowances. The clause does not cover subsistence allowances; it focuses on the narrower issue of an employer who pays a hotel bill but includes in that payment items that are technically taxable because they are personal benefits in kind. We are now saying that that is no longer a taxable benefit in kind, the employer need not report it to the Inland Revenue and the employee need not pay tax on it. The measure is a simple deregulatory one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dover asked what happens when someone is given a wadge of notes with which to pay for his accommodation. That is a different issue. It may be important and I should like to reflect on it and deal with it later. But it is a broader issue than the narrower deregulatory one concerning an employer who pays a hotel bill and must then go through it and pick out items that are taxable benefits. That causes aggravation. We are now saying that that need not be done if the amount is below £10 or £20 a night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is almost going down the path of what I wanted to clarify. It seems that if shipping companies pay allowances for seamen travelling abroad and the FTSE top 100 companies send business

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the clause is a deregulatory measure for employers, and given the sort of expenses that the exemption is meant to cover, we believe that the clause is reasonable. The higher limit of £10 for outside the United Kingdom already recognises the higher costs that an employee may incur when staying abroad. From 6 April, that may be met by the employer tax free. If someone is abroad for five nights, for example, the employer can pay £50 free of tax. If the absence covers a full two weeks, the sum would be £140. That should be adequate, in our view, to cover the kind of minor items of personal expenditure that we have discussed: newspapers, telephone calls home and items of laundry. That new exemption will come on top of the tax-free subsistence that employers pay at present to cover, for example, hotel accommodation, food and a glass of wine with an evening meal. However, I can tell my hon. Friend that we shall keep the amount under review and consider it from time to time in the light of the latest evidence that is available about the costs that people incur in hotels when they stay overseas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make the point that the United Kingdom shipping community—especially the Chamber of Shipping—warmly welcomed my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor's announcement of this measure last April, when he recognised that special tax provisions in other countries had introduced distortions in the shipping market. He said,
	<br><blockquote><p>"competitively, tax measures available overseas put our ship owners at a particular disadvantage."</p></blockquote>
The principle behind this and comparable amendments is to recognise that merchant vessels are not only expensive assets, but have a long useful working life—in some cases, significantly more than 20 years. For ship owners, especially those trading on the charter market, commercial success ultimately depends on crucial decisions, such as when to buy or sell that asset, or whether to tie it up in a long-term commitment such as a time charter, or to trade on the spot market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his book, "Maritime Economics", Dr. Martin Stopford makes the point that the fundamental decision strategy
	<br><blockquote><p>"is to spot charter on a rising market and, when the peak is reached, to sell or take a time charter long enough to carry the vessel through
	<span class='label label-info column'>468</span>
the trough. Ship acquisitions are made at the bottom of the market when ships are 'cheap'. Few would argue with this strategy of buying low and selling high.".</p></blockquote>
By introducing roll-over relief, which is warmly welcomed by my right hon. and hon. Friends, by the shipping industry and by myself, the Government have at last recognised the need to help ship owners to make rational decisions of the sort that I have described, based on market expectations and not on the need to avoid taxes. But—and this is the crux of the issue—at three years the period of the relief is simply not long enough to allow a totally rational decision to be made, based on the state of the markets. It has the effect of encouraging owners to make tax-avoiding rather than profit-maximising investment decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By using graphs that show the development of the market, it is possible to demonstrate how volatile shipping markets have been in the past few decades. Such graphs also clearly show that the cycles extend far beyond a three-year period. If, for example, an owner sold his vessel during a rising market, even under the new regulation he would have to reinvest the proceeds or face a tax charge three years later. At that stage, rates would still tend to be high and he would be forced into the sell high, buy high situation that I have already described.

I shall give a brief example, using the trip charter index and a 70,000 deadweight dry bulker. A disposal of that vessel in a rising market, for example in 1979 or 1987, would, under the proposed system, require reinvestment by 1982 and 1990 respectively at the very latest. That would encourage the purchase of the vessel at a substantially non-beneficial and sub-optimal point in the market. The same point applies to wet-bulk shipping as well.

All of the available evidence—much of which has been made available to my right hon. Friend by the Chamber of Shipping—shows that a period of at least five years, and preferably seven years, is necessary to achieve the sort of investment flexibility that I have described. For instance, a sale in 1987 of a tanker could have been followed by a purchase in 1992 or later, when the cycle had run its course. A longer period for the roll over would allow United Kingdom owners to exploit shipping cycles in exactly the same way that owners in other countries, such as Greece, do every year, and to invest in ships when the market dictates, rather than forcing them to invest prematurely because of fiscal considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Treasury Ministers have argued that to extend the period would discourage owners from making new investment. Experience has shown that early time limitations such as the current fiscal year are likely to stop owners from re-investing. Shipping is a fiercely competitive international market and undue pressure, for the wrong reasons, to invest too early could produce poor investment decisions. The roll-over period should be extended to seven years. That extension would give shipowners the necessary flexibility, given the historical trend in the market cycle in shipping.

The Opposition amendments are similar to mine, but insert a period of five not seven years. I imagine much of their reasoning is similar to mine. However, although five years might be seen as a Great British compromise, there is the danger that it might be unambitious. A period of seven years not five would give the appropriate flexibility that I am assured is needed by the shipping industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak to this amendment and to the amendments in my name and the names of my hon. Friends. As the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) has said, we propose a period of five years.

Since the Chancellor's statement last year, significant additional capacity to build ships has been lost in the United Kingdom, particularly in my part of the country. I was born in Sunderland, which was known as the largest shipbuilding town in the world for several years after the war. At that time, my grandfather worked in those yards as a boiler-maker—the elite of shipbuilding trades. I dread to think how he would react if he could see me moving such an amendment, when this country's capacity to build ships has decreased so drastically.

The Government's measure is welcome but, my goodness, how it reflects that the Government have abandoned a serious commitment to enable shipbuilding to remain a major part of the manufacturing industry in this country. One reason that the Government have given
	<span class='label label-info column'>470</span>
for introducing the measures is the country's defence needs. We know all too well that when the country was in difficulty we had to call on the Merchant Navy and had to commission merchant ships to assist the defence industry because, on its own, the Royal Navy was unable to meet the country's needs. During the Falklands war the merchant navy once more came into its own. With no pleasure we face the reality that, in similar circumstances today, we would probably not be able to meet that need with British ships and we would be dependent on ships from foreign countries with different interests from ours coming to our defence. That is an appalling indictment of the Government's lack of stewardship of such an important activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
