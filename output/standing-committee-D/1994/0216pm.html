	<div class='title'>VENTURE CAPITAL TRUSTS: RELIEF FROM INCOME TAX</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment moved [this day]:</i> No. 187, in page 269, line 38, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) In this part of this Schedule, the ordinary shares issued by a venture capital trust may include ordinary shares which do not carry the right to vote at meetings of the shareholders of the venture capital trust company.".—	<i>[Mr. Betts.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We just have a quorum. If my memory serves me correctly, the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) was about to end his speech. I believe that I was anticipating his peroration as we broke for lunch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Somehow I have a feeling that hon. Members have suddenly discovered that trains run on time in Britain these days and they have a desire to catch them, so I shall not detain the Committee too much longer. I hope that your lunch was not spoilt by the anticipation of further revelations about the technicalities of the schedule, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the lunch break, I was talking about the problems for smaller investors caused by the withdrawal of venture capital trust status from a company and the retrospective effect that that could have on relief for them. As I understand paragraph 1(6), VCT relief comes ahead of other forms of relief that may be available to individuals. If at some future date, even if it were some years later, VCT relief was withdrawn from an individual, would that person be able to go back and claim any other possible reliefs under (6) (a) to (f)? That could be important in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was trying to grapple with the schedule last night and I believe that I understood parts of it. I came across one part which I was not sure that I had understood correctly, but then I realised that the Financial Secretary would be here today to help me. I am talking about paragraph 1(9), which says that relief is eligible, provided the shares are bought
	<br><blockquote><p>"for bona fide commercial purposes and not as part of a scheme or arrangement the main purpose of which, or one of the main purposes of which, is the avoidance of tax".</p></blockquote>
The same words appear in paragraph 8(2)(c).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand that, because the VCT scheme appears to be based on the fact that tax relief will be available as an encouragement for people to invest in it. Tax relief surely means the right of people to avoid paying tax. The scheme's purpose is to attract people to that sort
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>330</span>
of investment rather than to another sort because they will be able to avoid paying tax that they might otherwise have to pay, but those two paragraphs state that if someone enters into an investment to avoid paying tax, the relief will not be valid and they will have to pay that tax. Can the Financial Secretary explain that apparent anomaly? If a person is not interested in avoiding tax, why should they enter the scheme? I hope that the Financial Secretary will be able to explain that to the small investors who read these paragraphs—perhaps he will get advice on it. If an element of risk is introduced in addition to that involved in the VCT company's investments it might be a reason why a small or medium-scale investor might be concerned about entering into such a venture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not the only one who perceives those problems. I read advice from leading accountants that said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although the wording is used elsewhere it seems unusual in a tax incentive provision. If the Government are required to offer tax incentives in order to encourage venture capital investment then it would seem that 'one of the main purposes' of the subscription and the issue of the shares is the avoidance of tax. If however one of the main purposes is not the reduction of tax, why is the relief necessary at all?"</p></blockquote>
It is hard to perceive the Government's or the Revenue's thinking behind the way in which they express themselves on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Financial Secretary will be good enough to explain the meaning of other paragraphs. I share the opinion of other hon. Members—expressed in respect of previous clauses—that some of the wording is too complicated. An ordinary investor would have to seek good professional advice in order to achieve some understanding of the schedule's meaning. If they are to be attractive, such schemes must be relatively simple, so that people can understand what they are entering into and any possible consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 1(8) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person shall not be entitled to be given any relief under this Part of this Schedule by reference to any shares if circumstances have arisen which would have resulted, had that relief already been given, in the withdrawal or reduction of the relief."</p></blockquote>
As I understand it, that means that if circumstances arise that mean that the relief is not valid, if the relief would not have been given to someone who has already had it, neither will it be given to someone who would have got it had the circumstances not changed. Why did the paragraph not say that someone will not get the relief if the circumstances change? That seems to mean the same thing, but the paragraph is a convoluted device to deliver that meaning. Why do the parliamentary draftsmen have to manufacture such convolutions when it is the Government's intention to set up a scheme to which not only rich investors, but some middle-income investors with a lump sum might be attracted?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Financial Secretary clarify the meaning of paragraph 7(3)(b)? It is assumed that the dividends will relate to accounting periods in accordance with the dividend resolution?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that this is a probing amendment. I have raised some of our general concerns about such a scheme, and also some specific concerns that might make the scheme less attractive than it would otherwise be to people who are not well versed in the technicalities of tax
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0693">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

legislation. Such people might be put off unless some of our points are clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my colleagues began—not, I am sure, trying to curry favour with you, Mr. Winterton—by making reference to Macclesfield Town football club and your comments the other day. I thank you for your tolerance and, in addition to sympathising with views expressed by my hon. Friends the Members for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) and for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson), I can say than I have actually visited Macclesfield Town's ground to see it for myself. The irony is that then I was collecting football league grounds, and I went to see a game played on that ground when Chester City were there. I think that that augments the arguments that you have been making, Mr. Winterton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall suggest to the Financial Secretary that he need not respond to the last remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sir George Young)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the third time that we have had an interesting debate on venture capital trusts. We touched on the subject on Second Reading of the Finance Bill; we devoted a substantial part of the Committee stage on the Floor of the House to VCTs; and we have had a canter round the course again today. Earlier deliberations of the Committee also touched on the matter. They have all been helpful debates and have revealed an element of consensus about the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debates have mirrored the Government's actions over the past year or so with the industrial finance initiative. That initiative considered not only savings per se, but where the savings go. I was interested to compare and contrast what the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe said with what his hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) said on Tuesday about TESSAs. She was concerned that we should marry the need
	<br><blockquote><p>"for productive investment in our economy with the encouragement of savings."—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 14 February 1995; 	<i>c.</i> 276.]</p></blockquote>
She went on to say that the role of the small saver in the economy would be increased if there was a direct link whereby people could see how their money was being invested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is of course, as I said in that debate, a range of savings products on which tax relief is given. The VCTs, which we discussed this afternoon, meet spot on the very concerns that the hon. Lady touched on two days ago. We need a spectrum of savings instruments that reflect the needs of savers and the needs of investors who will make productive capacity available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Attercliffe said that the scheme was at the riskier end of the savings spectrum. He asked about the effects on the small investor of the VCT losing its tax approval. The answer is the one that he anticipated—that the investor would subsequently lose his tax relief. That has to be right. I hope that it will not happen often, but it is an inevitable consequence of the scheme as structured and it replicates provisions such as those in the business expansion scheme. If the small saver wants his money to be safer, he need not invest in a VCT.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>332</span>
He can invest in other products that have greater investor security such as PEPs—or even TESSAs, which are safer. He could have a spectrum of investments, some safer and some less so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to raise several other important issues. First, he asked why have a ceiling of £100,000 rather than a lower one, such as £50,000. The amount of £100,000, with tax relief of 20 per cent., is the figure in the enterprise investment scheme. The figure derives from the fact that tax relief at 40 per cent. was given on £40,000 investment in the business expansion scheme. That is the broad logic for the figure of £100,000. We did not slavishly adopt the figure in other schemes. VCTs, which will effectively be quoted investment-type vehicles, will have high costs for market analysis, listing, promotion and so on. We had to recognise that when fixing the subscription rate on which tax relief would be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not to say, as the hon. Gentleman implied in his speech, that all those who are going to invest will be well-off investors, perhaps investing £100,000. This morning I touched on the average subscription in the EIS scheme, where again the limit is £100,000, but the average subscription is £7,000 for the small to medium-range saver. It is not true that, just because there is a high maximum, only the big rollers are attracted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman asked what trades we were trying to encourage. Again, we have reflected the approach of the EIS, which is to exclude non-qualifying trades. In that way, we ensure that we do not exclude a company inadvertently because it does not fit neatly within the qualifying trades that would be specified if we did as the hon. Gentleman suggested. That method would exclude innovative companies that set up an entirely new trade. For example, who would have thought 10 years ago that companies might be set up to manufacture virtual reality helmets and related equipment? The legislation would have to be lengthy to include all the companies that the Government want to access VCT funding. The right way to proceed is to exclude rather than to include.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's third question was whether we would monitor the development of those industries and the jobs that they produce. I mentioned earlier some of the uses to which the EIS has been put. I hope that in a year's time I will be able to report what activities the VCT scheme has produced. The Revenue will certainly be monitoring the activities because it will be approving them. I hope that it will produce a useful list for the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a great deal of interest in the scheme. Last month, 300 people attended a seminar, jointly sponsored by the Inland Revenue and the British Venture Capital Association, to discuss the legislation. I addressed the seminar and answered questions on the scheme. I was particularly impressed by the interest and enthusiasm of those attending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contrary to what Labour members of the Committee might imply, they were not licking their lips at tax scams for the wealthy. They know that venture capital is to do with risk. The legislation will encourage people to take risks. Some will be rewarded; others may not be. However, what should come from the scheme is the creation of jobs, and I suggest that that is what is important to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>333</span>
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the costs of the scheme. We have said that the Exchequer cost will depend on take-up. Estimates are highly uncertain. However, on the assumption that funds of about £2.5 billion will be raised over the next three years, estimated costs are £150 million in the tax year 1995–96, £290 million in 1996–97 and £240 million in 1997–98.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether those were total costs or whether there would be further costs. They are total costs and they break down as follows. In the year 1996–97, for which total costs will be £290 million, the breakdown is dividend relief, £15 million; capital gains tax relief, £5 million; front end income tax relief, £225 million; capital gains tax deferral relief, £45 million. Of course, those figures are very much dependent on take-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 187 seemed to suggest that ordinary shares would not include non-voting shares. I am happy to reassure the hon. Gentleman that he need have no worries on that score. Ordinary shares are defined in general tax law as all issued share capital, by whatever name called, of the company, other than capital, the holders of which have a right to a dividend at a fixed rate but have no other right to share in the profits of the company. So the amendment is superfluous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to be too provocative, but, perhaps, at some time, Opposition members of the Committee will produce similar proposals that are clearly defined, costed, popular, relevant and which meet the needs of industry, instead of sheltering behind the generalised waffle that we hear most of the time from the shadow Chancellor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It occurred to me that it would be an interesting philosophical question to ask whether it was the function of my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to explain to the hon. Member for Attercliffe exactly how the provisions will operate because, a few moments ago, the hon. Gentleman said that he did not understand these complicated financial matters. Is it really the duty of the Financial Secretary to explain away the ignorance of Opposition Members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I made that remark, I feared that it was highly provocative and might detain the Committee. We are anxious to make progress, so I undertake to make no similar provocative remarks for the rest of the afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to two final points raised by the hon. Gentleman. He implied that there was something Gilbertian about including an anti-avoidance provision in a schedule on, in his words, avoiding tax. Let me explain why it is necessary. The provisions require the individual investor to have acquired the shares in the venture capital trust for bona fide commercial purposes, and not as part of a scheme or arrangement, the main purpose or one of the main purposes of which was the avoidance of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman implied that the reference to bona fide commercial purposes was inappropriate to non-business investors. I have some sympathy with that point. However, bona fide commercial purposes is a phrase used extensively throughout the Taxes Act 1988. Its meaning is generally understood both within the Inland Revenue and outside. More specifically, it appears in section 289(6) of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>334</span>
the Taxes Act 1988 in relation to relief under the enterprise investment scheme and its predecessor, the business expansion scheme. Its use mere in analogous situations has not caused problems, and we have drafted the VCT legislation to follow the precedent as closely as possible, if only because it might otherwise be thought that a different regime was intended for VCTs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To conclude, there is widespread agreement in the Committee that there is a funding gap. Some firms have a high growth potential because they are able to benefit from innovation, but they cannot gain access to the funds that they need to expand. If we can encourage those firms, we can encourage economic development, new businesses will become established, small businesses will grow and that will result in employment. I hope that the Committee will embrace what I believe is an imaginative approach and welcome into the balanced spectrum of different savings this proposal to encourage businesses to start up, to encourage developing business and, above all, to create jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still have reservations about the scheme, and about the Government's overall approach, which might not be thought through properly. However, the Opposition do not want to resist a scheme that might have some benefits, as long as the Financial Secretary provides the monitoring arrangements that he described. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Schedule 15 agreed to.</i></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 66</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>CAPITAL GAINS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have several concerns about the clause, which relates to capital gains. Various problems will be created by the clause, particularly with regard to potential take-up of such schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From what date will the roll-over relief apply? The suggestion is that it should apply from 5 April 1995. The gains that are likely to benefit from the roll-over relief will accrue in the tax year 1995–96, from which tax will not be payable until late in 1996. Many people in the industry have put it to me that that will mean that investors will not be anxious to participate in the schemes until they get their tax bill. We might not see a substantial take-up of the schemes until the latter part of 1996, when the investors have to pay tax. We are therefore missing an early opportunity to get the schemes going. We seem to be running the risk that no one will bother to take up the schemes in any great number until they benefit from the tax concession. Neither side of the Committee should wish that to occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The least that we could do is to backdate the relief to gains accruing from Budget day, as is being done for EIS schemes. Personally, I should prefer it to be backdated to 5 April last year, so that we should be dealing with gains that accrue in the current tax year, and which may not yet have accrued, and may not do so until April 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0695">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>335</span>
My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary explained his reasons, when we debated the previous clause, for not backdating beyond Budget day last year, when the measures were announced. Unless we backdate at least to Budget day, the schemes will be at a severe disadvantage for more than a year from now, and they may not be attractive to investors for 18 months. I hope that my right hon. Friend will consider that point in detail, and come forward on Report with an appropriate amendment. I had hoped to table my own amendment, but, I am afraid, the parliamentary draftsmen let me down, and I did not receive the draft of the amendment until today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall put down a marker now to the effect that we are prejudicing the launch of the scheme until late next year, unless we reform in the way that I have suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the schemes resulting from the EIS will stand on all fours with one another. Unlike those schemes, capital losses arising for those who invest in venture capital trusts will not be allowable against other capital gains. That is extraordinary. The only other class of asset on which one does not pay tax on capital gains or gain relief on capital losses is the principal private residence. Some people argue that such a scenario should not apply there. However, that is a safe form of investment—at least we hope so. In this case, however, we are discussing high-risk investments. People who invest money in VCTs risk losing their shirts. At the very least, those investors should be able to offset their losses against any other gains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, those who roll their gains over into such a scheme should be allowed relief from those gains against any losses that accrue in VCTs; otherwise, what possible advantage are they sustaining? Had they kept their money where it was, they would not have provoked any potential capital gains tax, and yet, if they lose their money in the VCT they obtain no benefit against that loss that they will have provoked if the VCT winds up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to re-examine the timing of the tax concessions and the quantum so far as they relate to reliefs and losses in VCTs. Otherwise, I perceive that what many in the industry are saying is true: that the take-up of the schemes will be much lower than my right hon. Friend hopes and, I think, than all members of the Committee hope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To some extent this is a re-run of this morning's debate about whether one should backdate an element of the relief for VCTs, except that my hon. Friend has ingeniously taken account of some of my responses this morning and has modified his requests and lowered his sights. Instead of wanting the measure backdated to 5 April last year, he has gone back to Budget day. Although that represents a move, from the Government's point of view it is still not good enough. I should like to explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's point seems to be that there has to be a balance between making sure that the scheme is successful by enabling it to gather momentum and by ensuring that investors subscribe to it—that is clearly one imperative—and the need to be equitable between potential investors and not overcook the scheme by giving it more reliefs than can be justified. It would be perfectly legitimate to debate where that balance should be struck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>336</span>
Not every potential investor in a VCT is dependent on the kind of relief that my hon. Friend discussed. Many will not have access to those capital gains and may invest without such benefits. My hon. Friend's point is valid, but not necessarily for all potential investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments against including gains—if one were to go back all the way—to 6 April are similar to those that I set out this morning and I shall not repeat them. The arguments for including gains from 29 November might seem at first glance more attractive, but the case is unsustainable. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor announced the start date of the EIS and VCT changes on Budget day. The EIS changes were to have effect on Budget day and the VCT changes from 6 April 1995. Taxpayers knew at that time exactly where they stood. Those able to control the time of their disposals can wait until 6 April to realise their gains and, therefore, qualify for relief. However, I am unsure that additional resources that are generated by this backdating justify going back on that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An announcement by the Government now that gains between 29 November and 5 April could be reinvested in VCT shares and gain relief would still be retrospective and would still carry the same element of unfairness for those taxpayers who had realised gains in the time between November and now and had reinvested in other assets without knowing that, had they waited until my hon. Friend had moved the amendment and, in that scenario, it had been accepted, that reinvestment relief in VCT shares would have been available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend will appreciate that those who have realised a gain between 29 November and now will have no problem in obtaining the full relief if they subsequently invest in venture capital trusts in the current tax year. Crystallising a gain and reinvesting elsewhere does not prevent someone from disinvesting or investing other moneys equivalent to the gain in the current tax year and obtaining the equivalent relief. That point was made when we discussed the enterprise investment scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a point that my hon. Friend made before lunch and I have been reflecting on it. It is not as easy as my hon. Friend implies to disinvest because the relief is obtainable only on investment in specific sorts of companies—for example, quoted companies are not allowable. The process described by my hon. Friend—disinvesting and reinvesting—is not as easy as he suggests. Someone must be found to buy the shares. His suggestion sounded plausible before lunch but, having had time to digest it, it is not as attractive as he implied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also asked why there is no capital gains tax loss relief for venture capital trusts like the enterprise investment scheme. I touched on that this morning when I said that they are different schemes with different risk profiles and, therefore, different fiscal regimes. The venture capital trust reliefs have substantially increased since the consultation stage. We accepted representations for extra front end income tax relief and capital gains tax referral. Venture capital trust investors enjoy dividend exemption while enterprise investment scheme investors do not. We thought that we had got the balance of the tax

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>337</span>
regimes right. The enterprise investment scheme loss relief reflects the fact that, on a gradation of risk, enterprise investment schemes are a little more risky than venture capital trust investments, which are pooled investments and are quoted. It is defensible to have different fiscal regimes to reflect that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my right hon. Friend will appreciate that the management and dealing costs in a venture capital trust will be substantial. An absolutely all-fours comparison cannot be made, but it seems unfair that if someone were to invest in a venture capital trust and make substantial losses—that is quite likely with such schemes and we should not pretend that there is no prospect of loss—relief would not be available against other capital gains. That would be unique, except for a principal place of residence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I understand my hon. Friend's point, but we must put on the table all the tax reliefs that are available to those investing in venture capital trusts. They may not receive the relief which my hon. Friend identified but they receive other substantial reliefs which were topped up generously in the Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The total package is defensible. It is also defensible against the enterprise investment scheme, which involves a slightly higher risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 68 and schedule 17 simplify the benefit-to-settlor rules. The context of the schedule is an initiative which we launched last year to tackle complexity in existing tax legislation. We invited the Law Society, the Institute of Taxation and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales to identify legislation in need of simplification and we involved them in working out proposals to achieve it. The benefit-to-settlor rules were a prime candidate for simplification as they were built up piecemeal over half a century. They are difficult to understand and apply, some are virtually redundant and there is overlap and duplication. The purpose of the changes was not to increase revenue. Much of the simplification achieved by the provisions on schedule 17 were warmly welcomed, but anxiety was expressed about one aspect of the proposals—the new rules that tax the settlor on the value of any loan between settlor and trustees that is interest free or at a beneficial rate of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was particular anxiety about loans made to a trust rather than from it. Some of that anxiety was misplaced
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0697">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>339</span>
and arose from a misunderstanding of how the provisions operate. For example, initial comment suggested that the provisions apply to loans between individuals. That is not so; the rules apply only to loans to or from trustees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has become clear that there are more fundamental concerns about the application of the new provision on loans. In those circumstances we concluded that we should reconsider the proposals, which are intended primarily as a simplification, and it is important to ensure that any changes achieve that objective. It shows that those of us who are in favour of simplification do not have an easy road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government amendments remove the new loans provisions from schedule 17 and reinstate the existing rules that they were designed to replace. Further consequential amendments may be necessary on Report. Those who were worried about the effect of the new rules will welcome the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first part of the schedule deals with cases in which the settlor or the settlor's spouse has retained an interest in the settlement so that income or capital can be paid to them. In those cases, income arising under the settlement will be treated as the settlor's for all tax purposes. The new section 660A is based on the existing section 674A and most of the detailed rules that govern that section continue to operate. However, the new provision will apply to settlements whenever made, which means that a raft of earlier but similar provisions can be repealed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a settlement is in favour of a settlor's minor, unmarried child, a payment of income to or for the benefit of the child will be treated as being the income of the settlor. Payments of capital will also be treated as the income of the settlor for tax purposes, to the extent that they can be matched against unavailable undistributed income. Again, the new rules are based closely on those that they replace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, various supplementary provisions have been consolidated into a single set of rules governing the application of income tax charges. They remove unnecessary duplication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary has tabled many amendments to the Bill at the last moment which have the effect of restoring a tax loophole, which the Government seemed to want to close. New section 660C was supposed to stop rich tax dodgers using loan trusts set up by insurance companies to avoid certain aspects of inheritance tax and higher rate income tax. An estimated 10,000 individuals entered such arrangements, according to Mr. Michael Bryant of Rathbone Brothers, at a loss to the Exchequer of well over £6 million. Estimates from other sources suggest that it could be as high as £60 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the proposed new sections 660A to 660D of schedule 17, the Financial Secretary has the twin aims of simplifying the law and closing the loophole. Unfortunately for the right hon. Gentleman, the draft that he presented to us on 660C was so unfathomably complex that no one could properly understand it. It was so all-embracing that it seemed to end up trying to tax unintended areas such as loans by parents to children to buy a car, to go to university or to help buy a home, and loans to help charities to save social clubs and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>340</span>
Despite warnings from the Law Society, the Institute of Taxation, various City firms, Conservative Back Benchers, magazines and noble Lords in another place that the provisions were unworkable, the Financial Secretary allowed them to remain in the Finance Bill. At the last moment, he bowed to the inevitable and withdrew the original provisions of his own Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of ensuring, however, that the new wording would close the loophole, the Financial Secretary has restored the old regime under the new wording, thus preserving much of the loophole—at a time when ordinary families in my constituency are facing the highest ever tax burden. They will find it difficult to understand why the Government are allowing a tax loophole for the super-rich, which will cost them—the real taxpayers—more than £6 million. Such people cannot afford tax consultants and insurance advisers so that they can take advantage of the anti-avoidance scam. The provision is another example of the unfair Tory tax regime. Once again, belt tightening is to be the prerogative of ordinary families, while the Tories allow the super-rich to keep their perks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I share the hon. Gentleman's great concern for ordinary families, will he look back at history before he makes such wild and extravagant statements that the taxation of ordinary families is now the highest ever? [HON MEMBERS: "It is true."] It is not true. If the hon. Gentleman considers the record of Labour Governments from 1964 to 1970 and from 1974 to 1979, he will see that the effect of the Labour taxes was much greater on ordinary families than anything that has ever happened under a Conservative Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That intervention is out of order. It is far wider man the amendments that we are debating with Government amendment No. 156.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I invite the hon. Member for Blackpool, South to read the Red Book. That will demonstrate that what he said was complete nonsense. The higher tax rates are yet to come, and they will be the highest Tory tax rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In principle, the aims of the Labour party and those of the Government with regard to the schedule are broadly similar. We, too, want the tax loopholes closed. We also want clarification and, where possible, simplification of tax regimes. We do not want to tax ordinary loans within families when a parent genuinely seeks to help a young person get a start in life with some money for a house. Nor do we wish to penalise loans to charities or to groups that are trying to save local social clubs or societies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government went about the matter in an incompetent way. They refused to listen to any of the warnings from many sources. They started off all right—they consulted various interest groups to see how the tax regime should be simplified. The Government were advised that sections 660 to 685 of the Taxes Act 1988 presented a problem and needed reform. Indeed, since 1980 they had been used as a complex tax avoidance scheme. They drafted their reforms. Unfortunately they consulted about the problem but not about the solution—which made the problem worse.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>341</span>
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lesson that Government must learn is to consult on solutions that are proposed as well as on problems that have been exposed. I accept that clause 68 and schedule 17 were always going to prove difficult for the Government. Simplification was necessary precisely because of the difficult technical nature of the problem. The new sections 660A to 660D that clause 68 and schedule 17 would insert in the Taxes Act 1988 were meant to hang together to close the loophole. The proposed sections 660A and 660B were generally welcomed, except by some of their anti-avoidance scams. However, new section 660C caused considerable confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should examine the loophole closely, because it is complex. I draw for guidance on an article in 	<i>Taxation</i> magazine of 2 February 1995, by Michael Bryant, the marketing director of Rathbone Brothers plc. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Since … 1980, a popular arrangement has been for an individual to create a settlement by effecting a single premium unit-linked insurance bond for a nominal premium issued under trust for selected beneficiaries.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Subsequently a substantial interest-free loan is made by the settlor, or his spouse, to the trustees of the bond who effect a further single premium bond in the life of the settlor.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Each year, part of the bond purchased with the interest-free loan is encashed and used to repay part of the loan made by the settlor. The objective of the arrangement is to permit future investment growth in the insurance bond, over and above the value of the initial loan, to be held by the trustees outside the settlor's estate free of inheritance tax. The loan repayments are used by the settlor in the form of 'income' thereby reducing his estate for inheritance tax purposes.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>During the settlor's lifetime, income and capital gains reinvested within the insurance bond will have borne tax at the insurance company rate of 25 per cent".</p></blockquote>
He continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under the proposed new clause 660C these loans will become subject to tax on an amount equal to the official rate of interest applied to the outstanding loan during each fiscal year commencing on 6 April 1995, with no allowance for tax charged within the bond or on the maturity or surrender of the bond."</p></blockquote>
The measure appears to be an attempt to deal with what it described in that account. That is a laudable aim, but provisions aimed at remedying it are far from simple. That became clear when a BBC Radio 4 programme, "Money Box", decided to ask its advisers to look into the details of the clauses. The programme makers were advised that the measure would hit families and that parents who wanted to let their children have money to help with a house or similar matter would be adversely affected. It appears that the Inland Revenue promptly contacted the BBC and said that that was wrong and not its intention. After that expression of concern it was invited to send a representative to take part in the programme. A Mr. Andrew Dawson appeared on it to describe what the measure is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth going through the text, because of a matter that arises from it relating to the Financial Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interviewer said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"And still with tax, mere appears to be some confusion over the way tax is levied on any money that parents lend interest-free to men-children. In last November's budget, the Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, announced some simplification of the rules surrounding the setting up and use of trusts. But many parents who have lent cash to their children fear that they may be landed with a tax bill. Andrew Dawson of the Inland Revenue explains:"</p></blockquote>
Mr. Dawson said:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>342</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"There has been some confusion here. It's quite common for a parent to lend a child some money, perhaps to buy a house—to fund the deposit on a house—or buy a car. But where the parent simply takes the money out of the building society and hands it over to the child, there's no tax effect under the new rules."</p></blockquote>
The interviewer asked:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So who will these new rules actually affect?"</p></blockquote>
Mr. Dawson replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new rules affect people who are lending money to trustees or where the trustees lend money to them. But if there's no trust involved, then there's no tax charge under the new rules."</p></blockquote>
The interviewer said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There have, over recent years, been a lot of loan trusts set up by insurance companies to try and help people to avoid inheritance tax. Apparently about a hundred thousand people have taken out these trusts. Will they be affected by the new rules?"</p></blockquote>
Mr. Dawson said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Yes, they will. It's not certain exactly how many such trusts there are, but this is exactly the sort of situation that will be affected by the new rules. So where a person lends money to the trustees, and they use the … proceeds of the loan to buy a single premium insurance policy, then … the settlor of that trust—the person who lends the money to the trustees—will be charged to income tax on the annual value of that loan."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Dawson, who was put up by the Inland Revenue, believed that the new rules were an extension to catch the sort of tax avoidance that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary said that the purpose of the provision was not to increase revenue. Presumably, if the opportunities for tax avoidance are reduced, there is a greater tax take. Therefore, an opportunity to increase revenue exists. The purpose of anti-avoidance measures is to prevent people from unfairly using inadequacies in the tax regime to avoid paying their fair share of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the confusion continued. 	<i>Taxation</i> magazine subsequently included an article that stated that Mr. Dawson was wrong. The Institute of Taxation was scathing in its analysis of the provision. The press release issued by the Inland Revenue on 29 November 1994—IR21—contains the sentences:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the new rules are not primarily designed to alter either the extent or the amount of the tax charge. The Exchequer effect is expected to be negligible."</p></blockquote>
That accords with the Financial Secretary's words earlier in the debate. However, it accords neither with what Mr. Dawson said nor with a press release that the Inland Revenue issued on 4 January 1995. The latter deals with section 660C and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Unlike the first two charging provisions"—</p></blockquote>
that is, sections 660A and 660B—
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is significantly different from the existing rules."</p></blockquote>
That means that the provision does not simply replace existing rules. The press-release continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under the new rules, where the trustees of a settlement make a loan to the settlor or the settlor's spouse, or where either of them makes a loan to the trustees, the settlor will be charged to income tax on the annual value of the loan, calculated by reference to an official rate of interest less any interest paid for the year."</p></blockquote>
It also states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new rules, like the existing rules, will also apply where a loan is effectively made through a connected company. The annual value of any loan between the trustees and the company over a three year period will be matched with the annual value of any loan betwen the company and the settlor over the same period."</p></blockquote>
There is a conflict between the Inland Revenue's two press releases. The Financial Secretary should explain that. Even within the Inland Revenue, there is a lack of clarity about its proposals. Mr. Dawson and one press
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0699">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>343</span>
release said that the provision would increase the revenue, but the Financial Secretary and IR21 suggest that it would not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seemed clear to me—and to Mr. Michael Bryant who writes in "Taxation" magazine—that the provision would close a loophole and was an anti-avoidance measure. The Opposition, as well as the Government, would support that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Questions were asked in another place on 2 February. Concerns were raised about charities and it was clear that the provisions of section 660C were not operating properly. In the 	<i>Financial Times</i> on 4 February the Government announced that they were to make amendments to deal with that, but we had to wait until only a couple of days ago before those amendments started to appear on the Notice Paper. We ended up with an attempt to make a small change but a restoration of the pre-existing situation with most of the tax loophole, but perhaps not all of it—that is not clear—continuing to exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a sorry tale of good intentions frustrated by incompetence. That incompetence seems to have continued here today with the proposal to forgo the effective reform of the loophole and ignore the need for clarification by keeping something akin to the old regime. To keep section 660C in place is clearly wrong, so the Government must alter it. That would not achieve what I think we all would like to be achieved but to leave the old regime effectively in place is also wrong, so I hope that we shall be able to vote against the schedule as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members have repeatedly called for a concerted effort to remove tax avoidance loopholes and that is what we need. The Government's response to that seems to have been, first, to deny the existence of any such loopholes and then to say that they themselves will close them. Now they seem to accept that they are incompetent to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a time when tax increases are being imposed by the Government on ordinary families, the Financial Secretary must today undertake to find ways to amend the schedule on Report. To leave a situation in place for another year in which the rich can avoid paying their fair share of tax is unacceptable. The Government and the Opposition appear to agree on the intentions to close loopholes and simplify the law where possible. Let the Financial Secretary now agree to put those intentions into effect on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall ask a number of questions about the other provisions in the Bill, to be sure that what is left of the schedule contains the clarity that we need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with section 660A(4)(d). While understanding the proposal in that section that settled property will revert to the settlor on the death of his or her child where the child would have become beneficially entitled to the property at the age of 25, the Law Society has raised a query which the Financial Secretary ought to answer. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that a similar principle should protect the settlor of a settlement for his disabled child, where protection would be available but for the fact that the child is under a disability and so would not be capable of obtaining a beneficial entitlement."</p></blockquote>
Will the Financial Secretary clarify exactly what the provision will mean in that case? The Law Society was

obviously unclear about what it meant. Given that the objectives are clarification and simplicity where possible, I hope that the Financial Secretary will be able to provide that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute of Taxation has also been concerned with section 660A(4)(d). Its concern is slightly different. Will the Financial Secretary say whether narrowing the wording of the exemption to "child of the settlor" from "some person" in the equivalent legislation in section 73 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 means that a settlement by a grandparent on a grandchild would now become subject to income tax? Is that the financial Secretary's intention and, if so, will he set out the reasoning for doing that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point is that, since the Government's intention is to clarify the existing legislation, it seems unfortunate that even the Institute of Taxation is
	<br><blockquote><p>"unclear whether the impact of the simplification of the settlements legislation is to abolish tax relief for alimony payments paid under deeds of covenant or whether, for example, such payments are excluded from charge under the new Section 660A(8)."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister clarify the matter that so that laymen such as the Institute of Taxation can understand what is intended?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the new rules in sections 660A and 660B will apply to some settlements that are currently outside the existing legislation, because settlements in which income is paid retrospectively to the settlor will be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure about the implications of that and suspect, given the amendments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, that he probably is not sure either. Will the Financial Secretary say how far the measure extends the coverage of taxation and what his objectives are?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's objectives in undertaking the exercise were genuine and laudible, but I regret that they were not up to the job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was good of my right hon. Friend to acknowledge the role that the institute and other professional bodies played in advising the Revenue before the clause and the schedule were brought forward.

Friend oversees sensible reforms and adjustments to the original proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened as carefully as I could to the speech of the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North (Mr. O'Brien). He revealed a certain lack of generosity towards my right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for generously giving way.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a long time since I have been to a Laurel and Hardy film. Sometimes I believe that I would prefer one to being in the Committee, but we should debate that on another occasion. I would not like to be cast in the role of Oliver Hardy to my right hon. Friend's Stan Laurel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have been wise to make the changes and I hope for several reasons that my right hon. Friend will not overlook the possible need to go further along the lines of the changes that he has suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important reason was made clear in the press release of my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor at the time of the Budget: schedule 17 and the clause were primarily designed not to alter the scope or the amount of tax charged, but to enable a more sensible approach. It is good that my right hon. Friend has thought again about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To an extent, I am speaking to amendment No. 103, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. It was designed to remove any element of retrospection from the clause and the schedule as they originally stood. I am glad that a Government amendment is designed to meet that point head on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that mere is a need for fuller and more timely consultation with outside experts on all occasions when highly technical matters of tax legislation of this sort are brought forward. I also agree that it is useful to consult closely not only on the definitions of problems, but on sensible solutions. I hope that my right hon. Friend will ensure that his officials pursue that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was no compelling justification for section 660C in schedule 17, as originally drafted. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, lawyers and tax experts thought that its effects could have been even more pernicious than those of section 677 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which it was meant to replace. I judge that section 677 will go back into the Bill. That is one of the consequences of my right hon. Friend's remarks. When he replies, the Committee will want to be assured that the effects of returning to the status quo ante, albeit as amended by Government amendments, will be a net advance on the previous position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend will know that the briefing produced by the experts at the institute referred to the original changes, which we are now debating. It stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"many settlors will as a result start to incur tax charges which are entirely unexpected, and we believe that there is likely to be a major problem in identifying the cases and helping the relevant individuals to deal correctly with the notional income in their tax return."</p></blockquote>
I shall return to the point about notional income soon. As the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North said, that description applies especially to the many life assurance policy trusts that exist in that area. That central problem should be tackled as effectively as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>346</span>
The Government's move to eliminate the element of retrospection is very welcome. That is important when people are planning trusts, which they must do on a fairly long-term basis. It would have been disruptive if existing arrangements had been unsettled in the way that could have happened. To that extent, the spirit, if not the letter, of amendment No. 103, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, has been met completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had a few doubts about amendment No. 177, especially subsection (10) in which the Opposition seem to take great interest in illegitimate children. I am not sure why that is so. No doubt, they will tell us when they speak to the amendment. I understand the broader purposes behind the amendment. Clearly if we frame the Bill in such a way that it catches children, principal private residences, charitable trusts or the disabled, that will be unwise. I am glad that that point has been dramatised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a few questions about section 660C in schedule 17. I hope that my right hon. Friend will reply to them if he has not already covered them in his opening speech. I am only a layman in this subject, so I cannot put my hand on my heart to say whether he has answered the points or not. I hope that he will bear with us laymen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, will my right hon. Friend briefly set out why it was necessary to have a special charge on loans to settlors in the first place? That principle underlies many paragraphs of the Bill. Secondly, what is the justification for putting a charge on notional income and on distributed income? By definition, notional income has never crystallised and distributed income is already taxable on the beneficiaries. Thirdly, is there a case for introducing a form of territorial limitation into the provisions? However, I may have misunderstood them and they may already contain a limitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, does my right hon. Friend recognise that there is a clash between notional interest computed on an accruals basis, which these days is fashionable, with the development of accruals accounting in the public sector, while deduction for actual interest is on a paid basis? I suggest to my right hon. Friend that it might be more sensible for deductions also to be made on an accruals basis so that they are on all fours with the other category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is there no exemption for non-domiciled settlers of trusts? My understanding is that there is a large number of such people. It may be that, in natural justice, their interests have as much to commend them as domiciled settlers of trusts. One of the many reasons why people set trusts up is because their circumstances change and they find that their principal domicile is outside the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How would my right hon. Friend react to the suggestion that no tax charge should arise on a loan to a settler to the extent that income tax relief would have been available to him had he paid interest on the loan in the first place? Finally, could my right hon. Friend consider an exclusion for loans made with the settler to a connected company where such loans are made from bona fide commercial reasons? My right hon. Friend endeavoured to cover some of that in his opening speech, but I should like to hear a little more. If he feels it inappropriate to go into the matter during the Committee, which I know the Whip and others wish to abbreviate as much as is

civilised, perhaps he could write to me and other members of the Committee on detailed points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to leave one thought in your copious mind, Mr. Winterton. I hope that my right hon. Friend will provide convincing and reassuring answers to the points of concern put to him by the hon. Gentleman and me. I hope that he, and other Ministers, will recognise that the tax treatment of trusts as an area of tax law is of great interest to many people in the United Kingdom, not only to tax advice professionals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This country pioneered the whole legal vehicle that goes under the heading of trusts. Trusts are a unique English invention and should be cherished rather than damaged by developments in the tax law. They can do a great deal of good, as the hon. Gentleman implied, for families, charitable activity and the strength of civil society in an advanced country such as this. I hope that my right hon. Friend will bear those points in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Knowing that my colleagues are anxious that this should not be a long debate, I will keep my remarks brief. As a lay woman, I want to tease out confusion that I felt during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Warwickshire, North said he believed that there were shared, good intentions across the Committee on clause 68 and its schedule. I am not as clear about that as he is. I hope the Financial Secretary will make that clear. Reading IR21, the Inland Revenue press release, it seemed to me clearly stated that the effect to the Exchequer is expected to be negligible. I am unclear whether the Government's intention was to close a tax loophole, which we would have wanted them to do. The Prime Minister recently said that the role of Government was to tackle inequality and, in that context, we wanted an attempt to be made to close a loophole for the very rich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I read some of the briefings prepared for us on the Finance Bill, I was astounded to learn, from the one my hon. Friend the Member for Warwickshire, North quoted, why it was irrelevant to close the loophole. The article by Michael Bryant says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"with a top rate of 40 per cent. and a rate of 35 per cent on accumulated settlement income, there is little justification for the continuation of this complex legislative system."</p></blockquote>
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I interpret that, and I hope that I do so accurately, a 5 per cent. difference on investment income is nothing to the very rich; to the poor, it means an enormous amount. I think that it is iniquitous for us not to tackle so small a loophole. To do so could bring additional revenues to the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article, which all Opposition members of the Committee have seen, clearly indicates that the difference while advancing our intention, would hardly touch the pockets of the super-rich who buy single premium unit link insurance bonds as a way of ensuring that they pay tax at a lower rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Financial Secretary share the intentions eloquently expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Warwickshire, North? We want to close the loophole. Opposition Members have also expressed concern that the legislation should not be framed in such a way as to penalise charitable trusts and perfectly proper attempts to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>348</span>
assist children or people with disabilities to purchase homes. Concern is also expressed for golf clubs in some of the literature that has been distributed to us. I am not so concerned with golf clubs, but we must protect the interest of families and charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to tease out whether the Government are intent on closing the loophole and, if they are, whether they would agree to the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Warwickshire, North that we should close it with a properly framed clause, without damaging families or charities who want to set up trusts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support what my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman) said about the taxation of accrued and notional income. The Committee should be extremely suspicious of any taxation of income on an accrued basis. I realise that the whole of corporation tax is on that basis, because there is an assumption that companies' operating cash flow will always exceed their accounting profit. That is not always true in practice, as the Labour party should know, because it got itself into a frightful mess in the 1970s with stock appreciation relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also recognise that we need to tax accrued income in certain cases to cope with some tax avoidance methods, such as bond washing and roll-up schemes, but the Committee should be extremely sceptical about it. I have yet to be persuaded that there is any justification for taxing purely notional income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be frank, I was amazed by the contribution of the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North. It was uncharacteristically ungracious and unreflective. He made one singularly inappropriate remark, saying that the Government had shown, through their amendments to the schedule, a disregard for the interests of the unsophisticated taxpayer and a tendency to bring forward legislation that could be effectively exploited only by the sophisticated, professionally advised taxpayer. The reverse is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give only one example, because I do not want to speak for too long, but I have others in mind. Under the original wording of the schedule, perverse consequences would have flowed from it. For example, had a parent decided to make an interest-free loan to a child to buy a house, and that child was married and was buying the house in trust with his or her spouse, and that loan was made to the child as a trustee, holding the house in trust, tax would have been charged on the notional interest arising, under the original wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite contrary to the point made by the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North, the sophisticated, well-advised taxpayer would have ensured that he or she made a loan to the child—and the child used that sum for the purpose of buying the house—and did not make that loan to the child in the capacity as a trustee. The unsophisticated, unsuspecting investor could not afford to pay for professional advice and it quite unreasonable to expect the ordinary taxpayer to understand some of the gobbledegook in the Bill, including this clause. He or she would fall right into the trap and would make the loan specifically for the purpose of buying that house in trust and would, therefore, create a tax charge on notional interest income. Probably that poor, unsophisticated taxpayer would not, by definition, realise that he or she
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0702">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>349</span>
was falling into the trap and, therefore, would not make a declaration of that notional interest income. Consequently, the Revenue would go for them, under the later provisions in the Bill on the penalties under self assessment, for a major penalty. The unsophisticated taxpayer would have been doubly clobbered. My right hon. Friend's amendments would remove that danger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The picture that the hon. Gentleman is painting of the generality of taxpayers exploiting loopholes is an interesting one, but one divorced from reality. Will he accept that his remarks underline the fact that there is a tax loophole that has been exploited and that the Government amendments would effectively put us back to the original position and reinstate that tax loophole?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that, in the case that I described, there is a tax loophole. There is absolutely no reason why a tax charge should arise in dealings of that kind, anymore than there is any reason or logic why a tax charge should arise in the case of interest-free loans made to charities, to supporting the local village hall or for some local, good cause. My right hon. Friend has been extremely wise in removing those provisions from the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is attacking me for saying something that I have not said. Perhaps he misunderstood my comments and I shall give him the benefit of believing that he did. My concern was for the unsophisticated taxpayer who might have been caught by the clauses that the Government originally put down and are now seeking to change. The problem still remains that the sophisticated taxpayer will be able to get that advice to get around the remaining clauses, by reason of the amendments that the Government are now proposing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman has not made it more difficult for me to withdraw my original remarks, which I should like to have done. Once again, I think that he is accusing the Government of so drafting legislation that the unsophisticated taxpayer is disadvantaged thereby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must also say to the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North that it comes ill from both sides of the Committee—though particularly from the Labour party—to criticise the Government when they display some flexibility and judgment in being prepared to take a second look at the original text of the Bill. What the blazes is the point of the consultation exercises that Conservative Treasury Ministers have introduced into the whole business of drafting the Bill? What is the point of having the Committee, if the Government are not prepared to take a second look at the text brought forward by the Revenue? If there were no Committee and if there were no consultation—Treasury Ministers are too busy to start second-guessing legislation on their own initiative—we would live under the not-very-benevolent tax despotism of the Revenue. It would simply draft whatever measures it wanted and that would be the law, with all the anomalies, unfairnesses and so forth that would flow from it. Thank goodness that we have a free and open society and that we have consultation—and a Committee. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is a very important debate. I am trying to listen to the hon. Member for Stamford and

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should be more of a matter for gratification and congratulation for the Government when amendments are tabled than a matter for churlish complaint, as it has sadly been this afternoon. The Revenue employs some extremely able people, who do a good job on behalf of the country; but they make mistakes. When the Revenue thinks that it has identified an anomaly, it brings forward a massive piece of almost totally incomprehensible legislation—usually tens and tens of pages—which creates all sorts of problems. To use a familiar cliche, it uses a sledgehammer to crack a nut. If that sledgehammer were ever used, it would smash the sideboard and, indeed, the whole dining room. It is important that it cannot be allowed to get away with that. It has not—this afternoon my right hon. Friend used his judgment to restore some sense of proportion to the Taxes Acts. That is a matter for congratulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is sad for the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North. I have a terrible feeling that the sensible judgment of my right hon. Friend shot the fox of the Labour party. Labour Members probably prepared all sorts of speeches for this afternoon—Conservative Members, as Parliamentarians, can feel some sympathy for them—and intended to attack the absurd text of the original schedule. Suddenly they found that their speeches would not make sense and that they would have nothing intelligent to say. Naturally, they are disappointed. I offer my sincerest sympathy to the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North. I am sure that one day I shall find the rug pulled out from under me by a sensible Government measure. I hope that on reflection, the hon. Gentleman will join me in saying that the measure was sensible and well worth while.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I echo the important speeches made by my hon. Friends the Members for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) and for Carshalton and Wallington. I should also like to say what a pleasure it is to take part in a short debate in which contributions have been made by the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge), who has enormous expertise on the super-rich and by the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North whose comments were rightly described by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding as exceedingly churlish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I had to deal with trusts and settled land matters in my previous occupation as a barrister, I am extremely pleased that the ordinary people—about whom hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have spoken—have had their interests looked after and recognised through this sensible Government amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received helpful submissions from a couple of small firms of accountants—such as Shipleys Chartered Accountants—and also from Mr. James Cross, the senior partner of a firm of accountants in Canterbury called Reeves and Neylan. I think that the Government amendments will have dealt with their concerns. I ask my right hon. Friend to confirm what the effect of his amendment will be. The rules in the clauses and the schedule as originally drafted would have caught those people who were not deserving of a tax liability and whom Mr. Cross rightly said most people would regard as innocent. The result would have been that a gift of assets

to a spouse today followed by a minor return gift of any description out of those assets at any stage in the future could produce substantial tax problems for them both. The problems caused by the purchase of a house for children has been referred to by other hon. Members. There are significant concerns which the Government have rightly addressed. The speeches of Opposition Members have not been fair in view of the sensible way in which the Government have tabled their amendments. I greatly welcome the Government amendment.

6 pm</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You, Mr. Winterton, have been following this debate closely and you will have noticed that new sections 660C and 660D have not captured the Committee's imagination. All those who have spoken have criticised the provisions that were in the Bill and by implication have welcomed the decision to remove them. I should like to reply briefly to some of the principle points made in the debate and those that I do not touch on perhaps I can deal with in correspondence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of the remarks of the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North (Mr. O'Brien) and of some of his colleagues was that the Government have gone soft on tax avoidance. I should like to deal with that straight away. As I made absolutely clear when I introduced the amendment, the purposes of all the provisions in schedule 17, including the new rule on loans, was to simplify the complex benefit to settler rules. It was not the primary purpose of the exercise to impose a new income tax charge on taxpayers, taxpayers employing the schemes that the hon. Member mentioned or any other taxpayers. It was a simplification exercise, not a tax avoidance exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains many provisions on tax avoidance and no one should conclude that no action will be taken in future to deal with tax avoidance. I want to make that quite clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon.

Or does he agree with the remarks made by some of his hon. Friends which appeared to suggest that all such schemes were entirely acceptable to the Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are acceptable to the extent that they are legal. To the extent that they are tax avoidance schemes, they are inevitably vulnerable at some point to legislation. As I said a moment ago, there is quite a lot in the Bill to deal with tax avoidance. No one should conclude from the Government amendments that have been tabled today that no action will be taken on tax avoidance schemes in future. I cannot go any further except to make it clear that we have a tax avoidance strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A commitment has been given that amendments will be tabled on Report. Will the Financial Secretary tell us exactly what he proposes to do then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to come on to that. It is important that there should be no misunderstanding. I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>352</span>
said in my opening remarks that further amendments would be tabled on Report. We have tabled quite a few amendments which delete 660C and 660D, but we have to get back to where we were. We think that we have tabled most of the amendments to achieve that, but further amendments may be necessary on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. Member was probably hoping that I said, which I did not, was that we would be able to come up with a whole new strategy on Report. The consultation that we have already had was quite extensive. Contrary to what the hon. Gentleman implied, the Financial Secretary did not come up with a new scheme and impose it against the wishes of all advice and include it in the Finance Bill. We consulted with a wide range of people who nominated candidates for the working group, including the Institute of Taxation, the Law Society and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The working group and Inland Revenue officials reviewed the existing legislation and came up with the proposals. The hon. Gentleman would be pushing it a little if he expected us to produce on Report a solution to the dilemma with which the Committee has grappled, so the amendments that will be tabled on Report will simply ensure that we return to where we were. They will not produce an all-singing, all-dancing replacement for proposed sections 660C and 660D.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Financial Secretary is saying. As I have urged proper consultation, it would be difficult for me to say that such consultation should not take place. The Financial Secretary accepts that there is a need to clarify, to simplify and to close loopholes. That is what the original proposals tried to do. Is he saying that he does not know what to do? He certainly will not do anything about the matter this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government will reflect on the debate and on the representations that we have received. In due course, we shall produce an alternative strategy, but we cannot undertake to do so by Report. I hope that those who have taken part in the debate and seen the sheer complexity of the legislation will understand why that it so. We intend to return to the existing regime and undertake a consultation exercise to try to produce a better solution than that in proposed sections 660C and 660D.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding made a robust speech in which he implied that those who work for the Inland Revenue smash up sideboards. I defend those who work for the Inland, Revenue. They are a fine body of men and women. They are accountable to Ministers. They are non-violent people who are doing their best to ensure that taxes agreed to by Parliament are collected and paid by those who should do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked many specific questions. It would be best if I replied to them in writing. I was attracted to the suggestion that there should be an exemption for disabled children. In practice, however, what was suggested would be fiendishly complicated. In the context of a simplification exercise, we could not provide special rules for particular groups of people.

Maintenance payments are not affected. Nothing in schedule 17 will affect the special relief for such payments. Payers will continue to be eligible for relief.

Somewhere in my folder, I have a well-written speech which explains why the Government intended to introduce proposed sections 660C and 660D. It is now redundant. But, if my hon. Friend wants to read it, I shall let him. In a nutshell, what is now proposed is simpler than the previous system.

Loan provisions would not have applied to loans to golf clubs. Loans to individuals holding property under trust for sale would not have been affected.

The debate has been good and helpful, if somewhat chastising, for the Government. I hope that we can make progress with the Government amendments. I hope that the schedule will not be disagreed to. That would leave a large hole in the tax system which would not be in the interests of tax collection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been an interesting debate which has resulted in the Government being justifiably chastised for the way in which they have proceeded. I shall briefly state the Labour party's policy.

The Financial Secretary seems to have said that the Government wants clarification and simplification. He told us that he had not gone soft on loopholes. But he seems only to intend to reflect on those loopholes for another year. That news will be welcome for the estimated 10,000 to 100,000 rich tax dodgers who take advantage of how those tax loopholes work, to the disadvantage of taxpayers. Every tax dodger prejudices every taxpayer. One person's failure to pay tax means that other people have to make up the loss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being loose with his language—a common mistake of Opposition members of the Committee. If people outside the Room heard him say the words, "tax dodger", they would fairly assume that he was referring to people who evade their legal responsibility to pay tax, not those who legitimately—as my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has already pointed out—take steps to avoid, mitigate or minimise their tax liability. Will the hon. Gentleman make that distinction clear?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard the hon. Gentleman make that point—which is quite right in legalistic terms—several times in the Committee. It is right that there is a distinction between evading and avoiding—a distinction which I understand and know quite well. However, by drawing attention to that distinction, the hon. Gentleman is almost trying to give a moral integrity and legitimacy—he used the word "legitimately"—to tax avoidance. He must remember that the objective of the House is, and ought to be, to try to create a fair system of taxation. Where people are using the inadequacies—and sometimes incompetence—of the Government in their drafting to avoid paying what they ought to be paying in a fair tax system, that is not normal or, in my view, legitimate, even if it is legal. The difference between us is that Conservative Members think that there is a certain moral legitimacy to not paying taxes, while Opposition
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>354</span>
Members do not accept that there is any legitimacy to failing to pay fair taxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is misrepresenting me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Warwickshire, North is not giving way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am seeking to be brief, because I know—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope it is a point of order for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it in your competence, Mr. Winterton, to rule on whether an hon. Member has the right to intervene on another hon. Member if his position has been deliberately misrepresented?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington that only the hon. Member on his feet has the authority to give way. I cannot instruct anyone to give way to enable another hon. Member to make an intervention. If the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North is not giving way, that is his decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington can prolong the debate by speaking after me, if he wants to.

The Opposition feel that we cannot leave proposed new section 660C as it is, so we accept the Government amendments and will not oppose them. However, the Government are effectively preserving a loophole that should not be preserved. We will therefore vote against the schedule. Let it be clear that the Labour party is not saying that it does not think that the anti-avoidance measures ought not to be included—better some anti-avoidance measures than none. However, the Government are restoring a loophole that we—and, it appears, they—do not think ought to be there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take the opportunity to make a 30-second or even a 20-second speech to tell the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North and the Committee that I made it crystal clear when speaking, in support of my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary that I was not speaking about the morality or otherwise of tax avoidance measures—or of all those who advise those who legitimately avoid tax. I was speaking about the legality of it and urging the hon. Gentleman to accept that the Committee is dealing with legality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
