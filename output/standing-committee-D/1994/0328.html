	<p>[MR. JAMES HILL 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Atomic Energy Authority Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. At column 25 in the 	<i>Hansard</i> for our previous sitting there is an exchange between my hon. Friend the Member for Kirckaldy (Dr. Moonie) and the Minister on marine safety. I did not intervene then because I wanted to check the facts. That issue must be clarified at some stage in our consideration of the Bill, so I would like to put on record some pertinent information that I obtained from the Library and which concurs with what I know of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Warren Spring used to work on marine safety. Some work was transferred to AEA Technology and some was discontinued. The marine environment work transferred to AEA Technology from Warren Spring was worth £1,520,000—as was the effluent work. Work on ship safety, which was worth £50,000, was, however, discontinued. AEA Technology chose which business centres to transfer after it had examined Warren Spring laboratory's business stream.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ship safety programme, which dealt with the behaviour of cargoes, was also closed down. Equipment worth £100,000 for simulating the movements of ships and their cargoes was lost. Warren Spring was keen for that equipment to be taken over by the Marine Safety Agency, but that has not happened. Given the importance of this issue and the fact the role of the Marine Safety Agency has been debated on the Floor of the House. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us what action is being taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a curious point of order. I am sure, however, the the Minister has taken note of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='schedule'>Schedule 1</div> <!-- schedule -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>TRANSFER SCHEMES: SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 22, in page 9, line 4, at end insert ',provided that no property which may contain any fissile or other controlled material shall be transferred unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that control of that material meets any requirement of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (Cmmd 4474).'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, when property that had contained controlled materials—plutonium and enriched uranium in this case—is transferred, the safeguards required by the non-proliferation treaty are in place. Those safeguards would be
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
similar to the requirements placed on British Nuclear Fuels Ltd., which have been specified in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a sensitive issue and involves several problems. I referred in our previous sitting to the ownership of site licences and to a statement by the UK Atomic Energy Authority that some of those licences might be transferred to other parties in some circumstances. I know that the Minister and his staff will work on that and that, at some stage, we will received an adequate reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the problem, that when we discuss plutonium and enriched uranium, constraints might be placed on us by the Official Secrets Act. It is not much use to the Committee if the Minister stands up and says that he can say nothing on the subject because it is a secret. I sincerely hope that will not be the case today. I do not know whether there are any provisions for the Committees such as this to meet in private—that would allow the Minister to be a little more forthcoming. Perhaps all will be made clear as we go ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various UKAEA sites use, store or transport special nuclear materials such as plutonium or enriched uranium, as does BNFL. We are concerned that there should be adequate safeguards and controls built into the legislation to ensure that we comply with appropriate international standards. At present, such controls are not included in the Bill. Perhaps they are considered unnecessary—if that is the case, I am sure that the Minister will tell us why and will provide certain guarantees on the presence of materials specified in the Bill. If that does not happen, it is encumbent on us to ensure that the legislation is adequate to cover all eventualities on what is a very sensitive subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two possible approaches: special nuclear material facilities for working with or transporting special nuclear materials and people who work with, store or transport special nuclear materials could be added to the list of items that may not be transferred under the Bill's provision. That is a current provision of schedule 1 (3). On the other hand, we could ensure that schedule 1 of the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 applies to all successor companies owning, storing, working with or transporting special nuclear materials and to any other companies to whom such activities are transferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 1 (5) (2) of the 1965 Act requires that the specified body corporate be subject to ministerial directions in the interests of national security. However that does not, of itself, ensure that non-proliferation treaty obligations are fulfilled. There would have to be an additional duty on the Minister to satisfy himself and, perhaps, to report to Parliament that he had done so, with details, that the specified body corporate, whoever that might be, complied with the requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency, published in document INFCIRC/225/Rev 2 under the title "The Physical Protection of Nuclear Material" and the provisions of the convention on the physical protection of nuclear material, of which the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0441">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
United Kingdom is a signatory, are the appropriate regulations which apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minimum standards for the physical protection of special nuclear materials in force in UKAEA meet the current requirements. BNFL is required by ministerial directive to observe the security standards and procedures in force from time to time in UKAEA—BNFL has to observe the same standards and procedures as UKAEA. Surely any other companies having special nuclear materials should also be subject to ministerial directive about its safe keeping, which schedule 1 of the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule is rather complicated as you, Mr. Hill, are probably dismally aware. I propose to refer to some of the specific items in it. Paragraph 1 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this schedule 'the specified body corporate', in relation to an order made under section 2 of this Act, means the body corporate specified in that order, as being a body to whom the Minister has granted a permit as mentioned in subsection (1B) of that section, and 'site to which a permit applies' means a site in respect of which a permit so granted to the specified body corporate is for the time being in force."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that is crystal clear to you, Mr. Hill, and to the Minister. I confess that when I read it late on Friday night, I had difficulty working out exactly what it meant. I sometimes feel that schedules become more and more convoluted as additions, consequent on something that has been said already, are made to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 1 (2) of the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1971 goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911, any office or employment under the specified body corporate shall be deemed to be an office under Her Majesty".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 3 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every site to which a permit applies shall, for the purpose of section 3 (c) of the Official Secrets Act 1911 (which provides that places belonging to or used for the purposes of Her Majesty may be declared by order of the Secretary of State to be prohibited places for the purposes of that Act), be deemed to be a place belonging to or used for the purposes of Her Majesty."</p></blockquote>
Various other points are made. I am trying to illustrate the complexity of the legislation that governs the control, safe storage and handling of special nuclear materials. Paragraph 3(2) of the 1971 Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No person other than—
	<ol>
	<li>a constable acting in the execution of his duty as such, or</li>
	<li>an officer of customs and excise or inland revenue,"—</li></ol></p></blockquote>
I am sure that many of them would want to keep an eye on such matters—
	<br><blockquote><p>"acting in the execution of his duty as such, or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>c</i>) an inspector appointed under section 24 of this Act,"—</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
that is, the Atomic Energy Act 1971—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>d</i>) an officer of any government department specially authorised in that behalf by or on behalf of a Minister of the Crown, shall, except with the consent of the specified body corporate and in accordance with any conditions imposed by them, be entitled to exercise any right of entry".</p></blockquote>
Those are complex procedures governing the safe storage and handling of nuclear material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The activities of the AEA are currently so clearly bound up with the handling of nuclear materials that we need to know the extent to which prohibited materials under the 1971 Act are involved in any subsequent transfers. Such transfers are proposed to be made initially to public companies but later, after the initial transfer—as the Government have clearly indicated—to private sector companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5 of the 1971 Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The specified body corporate shall comply with any directions which the Minister may give to them for the purpose of safeguarding information in the interests of national security; and a direction under this sub-paragraph may in particular require the specified body corporate to terminate the employment of any person specified in the direction who is an officer of, or employed by, that body or may require that body not to appoint a person so specified to be an officer of, or to any employment under, that body."</p></blockquote>
That suggests that, were any successive company to handle such material, the Secretary of State would be required by law to be involved in overseeing the appointment of staff. I am sure that the Minister will satisfy us that that is not the case and that no such materials are involved, but I suspect that he might have difficulty doing so because of the wide-ranging nature of the responsibilities of AEA Technology as an agent that is to decommission nuclear facilities, rather than as the holder of the licence that allows that to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Industry and Energy (Mr. Richard Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that is no problem. We shall see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 6 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Except with the consent of the Minister the specified body corporate shall not terminate on security grounds the employment of any person employed by them.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In this paragraph 'security grounds' means grounds which are grounds for dismissal from the civil service of Her Majesty, in accordance with any arrangements for the time being in force relating to dismissals from that service for reasons of national security."</p></blockquote>
It may seem that I am making a big fuss about a small matter, but even small volumes of special nuclear materials are of critical importance. Their management is equally important in ensuring that there is no proliferation of nuclear weapons technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past 10 to 15 years, a considerable number of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
countries successively acquired fissionable material to make their own nuclear weapons. That happened in Israel, for example, which is now—as is well-known—a nuclear power with nuclear weapons at is disposal. There was the problem with Iraq before the invasion of Kuwait. Iraq attempted to secure various technologies to allow it to make fissionable materials to construct an explosive device, and it installed centrifuges to refine relatively dilute preparations of nuclear material. Significantly, not much material has to be present, provided one has the technology to extract and amass it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the time of the Gulf war, I was contacted by an outside party who was involved in computer research and who had been contacted by Jordan—that shows the devious ways by which people can get round the provisions of international agreements governing sensitive technology. He was given a very detailed specification and asked to design what he was told was a traffic management system. He was not daft. He examined it carefully and thought, "This isn't a traffic management system. This is a missile guidance system." Jordan has no desire or need for assistance with traffic management—and certainly not the university of Jordan, which purported to be the leading agency in that project. It was in fact part of Jordan's attempt to acquire a technology that would allow it to deliver fissionable nuclear weapons. The then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the right hon. Member for St. Albans (Mr. Lilley) quickly reassured us that there would be no question of any such system being granted an export licence and Jordan's attempt came to nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Countries that do not possess nuclear weapons and desire to do so will act deviously and cleverly to secure the materials that they need. The excellent research note produced by the Library about six months ago on the extent of the non-proliferation treaty—I use that example to emphasise that we are at a critical time in regard to non-proliferation—states that the 1970 agreement is due for revision. There is some doubt about whether agreement on the future conduct of such activities will be secured by all the parties concerned. We are talking about a fair number of states. Pakistan, which has the capability to produce devises; India; North Korea—there has been much press coverage recently about North Korea's putative activities and the difficulties that inspectors have had in overseeing them; South Korea; Iran; Iraq; Libya; Algeria and Syria might all be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how much material is involved in those sites and I have no way, and no particular desire, to find out. If any material is involved, it is surely incumbent on us to ensure that the same standards and provisions apply to any successor company to AEA Technology, as currently constituted, as apply to the Government agency remaining in the public sector and to BNFL.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has no destructive impact. It is intended to be constructive. I hope that its provisions are not over-onerous and that it—or a similar amendment—will be accepted by the Government now or later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a degree of uncertainty about
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
disposal as proposed by the Government, which could have important effects on the national interest. The House first started debating the issues back in 1981 in relation to the disposal of the radio chemical centre now known as Amersham International. The same matters were debated then in 	<i>Hansard</i> for 10 February 1981. The hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North (Sir T. Skeet)—not normally a natural bedfellow of the Labour party—made some interesting observations. Referring to the Atomic Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, the Government have made it even broader. Fortunately, we can dispose of all the companies. We could even dispose of the AEA with the Minister's assent. However, the Government have been wise. They have provided that disposals may take place only if they will promote the national interest. That is the safeguard. I should not like the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil to complain about the national interest. The number of things done by the Labour party in the national interest is legion"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was waiting for a "Hear, hear". He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One thing can be relied upon."—</p></blockquote>
no doubt Conservative Members will provide the "Hear, hear's" now—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Conservative Ministers take it very much into account."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 10 February 1981; Vol. 998, c. 766.]</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friends and I are inviting the Minister to do just that by accepting the amendment. My hon. Friend has already provided examples of the uncertainty that many people feel, so it would be in the national interest to accept the amendment. Its acceptance would be a powerful signal to those outside this country who have been party to illicit disposal of fissionable materials that this country takes that matter seriously. We are talking about products, a small amount of which could be extremely harmful—either in their raw or refined state. We must send a powerful message to such countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I followed the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy, only becoming distracted when he started to talk about specific bodies—corporate bodies and the like—that became difficult at times. I share my hon. Friend's anxieties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) spoke about uncertainty over the Government's proposals. The public are extremely sensitive about health, environmental safety, security and non-proliferation. We are seeking maximum assurance on how those issues will be handled, and rightly so because people would not understand if we did not. We want to ensure that the Minister remains directly responsible and directly answerable to Parliament for those issues, and that, by transferring or privatising any of the sites, we do not loosen the lines of accountability for the control of substances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
My hon. Friend referred to efforts made around the world to secure nuclear capability. That must be at the top of the agenda of many countries—the list is almost endless. Many countries are, to say the least, less than stable. Given what is happening in the former Soviet Union and other parts of the world, we must not be complacent. We are a potential source of materials and equipment that could enable such countries to build up their capability. Any complacency is ill-founded. In the past, our arms manufacturing industry has been used by countries, through third parties, to gain access to technology that we would not want spread around. There is no room for complacency, and I hope that when the Minister said, from a sedentary position, "No problem", he was not showing complacency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should go as far as he can in telling us the status of the sites and the nature of the materials. We understand that he may be under some constraints, but he should assure the Committee, if he is able, that there will be no breach in those lines of accountability and that people can be satisfied that maximum protection will remain in place under this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unusual for a Minister to say that he appreciates an Opposition amendment, but in this case—I hope that this does not become a habit—I am glad that the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) moved this amendment and that it has been drawn out and elucidated by his two colleagues. This is an important area and I welcome an opportunity to respond to their genuine concerns and the observations that they made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help if I deal initially with the amendment and then with more specific points. The amendment would place the Secretary of State under a duty to ensure that he is satisfied that the requirements of the treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons are met before any property that may contain any fissile or other controlled material is transferred. It may help to put in place a triple lock—I am borrowing that phrase. The first of those locks is the Export of Goods Control Order 1994, which provides that any export of such materials and equipment requires a licence. No licence is issued unless my right hon. Friend is satisfied that the treaty's requirements are being met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second lock is the Nuclear Safeguards and Electricity (Finance) Act 1978, which gives effect to the international agreement between the United Kingdom, the International Atomic Energy Authority and Euratom for the application of safeguards in the United Kingdom pursuant to the non-proliferation treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third lock is that we are bound by the Euratom treaty, under which all civil nuclear material in the United Kingdom is subject to safeguards administered by the Euratom safeguards directorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulatory framework under the Euratom treaty ensures control of all civil nuclear material wherever it is held. That framework applies, and will continue to apply, to all activities in the United Kingdom, irrespective of who
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
undertakes them and of whether they are in the public or private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members were right to raise questions about the special nuclear material. AEA Technology currently performs a small amount of work on special nuclear materials—SNMs—owned by customers. AEA Technology does not hold or own SNMs in its own right. After privatisation, that work will be done in buildings that will remain under the control of UKAEA's Government division for licensing purposes and subject to arrangements for nuclear accountancy approved by Euratom. There will be no change in the basic regulatory position. We do not intend to transfer any fissile material or plutonium of any isotope composition to a successor company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At out first sitting, the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy referred to the possibility that the UKAEA Government division would hand safety responsibilities to contractors. That is completely independent of our proposals to privatise AEA Technology, but it is intertwined with comments made today and I shall take the opportunity of responding. On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Industry and I made it clear that overall responsibility for the management for the UKAEA's nuclear liabilities remains and will remain with the Government division. That includes overall responsibility for safety at the nuclear sites. The Bill will not affect that arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UKAEA's Government division has the responsibility—which is strongly endorsed by the Department—to contract out the decommissioning of nuclear facilities to commercial contractors, wherever possible and on a competitive basis. As a general rule, the division believes that the best approach to the policy is for the division to retain the relevant nuclear site licence and overall safety responsibility. That approach was adopted in the decision announced on 13 March to appoint a site managing agent at Dounreay. It also underlies Government policy on current proposals for divestment or contractorisations for a small number of teams. However, that is the Government division's general approach—it should not rule out exploration of alternatives. The division is conducting such exploration in the case of stage 2 of the decommissioning of the Windscale piles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
UKAEA Government division is at an early stage of exploring how to structure the project. To help inform the process, it has asked other organisations to give their views on not only the conventional option of working under the Government division's nuclear site licence but an alternative involving the contractor holding a nuclear site licence. That approach would involve a departure from UKAEA Government division policy, but the division would be failing in its duty if it did not examine any method of achieving value for money for the taxpayer. However, it would only pursue that alternative if it were satisfied that safety would not be compromised and if significant cost savings could be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a crucial regulatory issue. Before any nuclear
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
site licence is granted, the nuclear installations inspectorate must be satisfied that the applicant has an adequate management structure and resources to discharge the obligations that result from it being granted a licence. The applicant also has to develop and submit a management prospectus that demonstrates commitment to health and safety. In addition, the licensee must present a satisfactory safety case for the facility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Detailed control of all the licensee's activities relevant to safety is achieved through the licence conditions and continuous monitoring of compliance with those conditions by the nuclear installations inspectorate. The conditions are legally enforceable under statutory penalties, and failure to comply with them is a criminal offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The option of a contractor holding a nuclear site licence for the piles could and would, therefore only be implemented, if Government division and the nuclear installations inspectorate were entirely satisfied that the contractor would maintain high safety standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that private sector companies are not safe nuclear operators and should not be given nuclear site licences. There are, however, already several private sector companies, such as Amersham International, Rolls-Royce and Associates, Babcock Rosyth Defence Ltd., Devonport Management Limited and ICI. They all hold nuclear site licences and operate safely under them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Safety is ensured not by public sector or private sector control, but by regulation. The regulatory system ensures equally high safety standards whether licensees are public or private sector companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned three stages at which checks take place and protection is available. The hon. Gentleman rightly emphasises the importance of ensuring that obligations set out under the non-proliferation treaty are met and that leakage of SNMs does not take place from any source under United Kingdom jurisdiction. The privatisation of AEA Technology will not result in such leakage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall finish as I started, and thank the hon. Gentleman for giving me the opportunity to put the Government's views on record. I hope that he will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for introducing issues from our previous sitting, which are perhaps of only peripheral relevance to the amendment. We must, however, set the record straight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the Minister's clarification on the issue of nuclear site licences, but it is a major departure from the Minister of State's remarks on Second Reading. I am sure that no intentional duplicity is involved here, but the Minister of State none the less said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the nuclear site licences at AEA sites will continue to be held by UKAEA Government division. It will, therefore, retain ultimate responsibility for safety at all UKAEA sites."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 14 March 1995; Vol. 256, c. 699]</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
That is obviously not the case, and I shall return to the matter in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the control of materials, I accept that three important safeguards are in place. They are, however, largely technical and administrative procedures and must be followed before a legal export licence is granted. I say legal, but countries that do not have nuclear weapons obviously do not acquire such material legally because no one would sell it to them—although that is not always the case. I could refer to one or two instances of countries acquiring technologies from official sources by other, dubious means, with a nod and a wink from the relevant agencies or from some of their employees. I will not do that because you, Mr. Hill, would rule such detail out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my opening remarks I referred to security, the Official Secrets Act and the vetting of people involved in handling SNMs. Such vetting is required by the Act. It is not considered merely desirable. Will that requirement remain? Will a company transferred out of the UKAEA that deals with SNMs be vetted? I accept that the Minister may not be able to answer now if the matter is secret, but those questions are important. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 10, leave out lines 5 to 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 1(4) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No liability of the Authority in respect the Authority's commencing capital debt under section 1 of the Atomic Energy Act 1986 or in respect of any loan made to them under section 4 of that Act shall be transferred by a transfer scheme except to a company which—
	<ol>
	<li>is wholly owned by the Crown, or</li>
	<li>is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Authority."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 17 would delete the last two subparagraphs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment, designed to glean clarification from the Minister. Is the paragraph a purely technical requirement of legislation such as this? I was involved in the Bill privatising the British Technology Group three years ago, and I cannot remember whether that Bill had a similar provision, even though similar debts must have been involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To what debts does paragraph (4) refer? If they cannot be transferred, how will they be written off? What procedures will be involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can easily answer the hon. Gentleman's questions. When the Atomic Energy Authority became a trading fund in 1986, it was given a commencing capital debt of about £80 million and the right to borrow from the national loans fund to finance its activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commencing capital debt is now some £44 million, but UKAEA's total indebtedness to the national loans fund
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
is about £155 million. The Bill would permit the transfer of some or all of that debt to a successor company or companies while it or they were in the public sector. The amendment would rule out that possibility, and thus prevent the successor companies from contributing to the debt repayment. If the hon. Gentleman, as a good socialist, is concerned that the privatisation company will benefit at the expense of the taxpayer, he can rest assured that it will not. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One hundred and fifty-five million pounds is a substantial sum. We are talking about a company that, if it is transferred to the private sector, we hope will trade properly. I hope too that the Department will not attempt to unload unfair levels of debt on to the successor company. As far as I am aware, AEA Technology was set up as a spin-off from the central activities. It seems unfair that the successor company should have to assume any burden of responsibility for debts that were properly incurred by a Government division. That may well be of more interest to the Minister's hon. Friends than to me: I may return to the matter when I have more information, but for the moment I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bet to move amendment No. 18, in page 11, line 27, leave out 'may' and insert 'shall'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 6(1),
	<br><blockquote><p>"Proof of title by certificate",</p></blockquote>
of schedule 1 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Authority and any person to whom anything has been transferred in accordance with a transfer scheme may issue a joint certificate stating that
	<ol>
	<li>any property specified in the certificate, or</li>
	<li>any such interest in or right over any such property as may be so specified,</li></ol>
is property, or (as the case may be) an interest or right, which was intended to be and was vested by virtue of the scheme in such one of them as may be so specified; and any such certificate shall be conclusive evidence for all purposes of that fact."</p></blockquote>
When we talk about transfer of property, it is incumbent on us to ensure that any person to whom the property is transferred acquires a good title with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke to the Minister earlier about that matter and he was kind enough to write to me, largely clearing the matter up. The Minister said in his letter that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the UKAEA operates on six sites: Culham, Dounreay, Harwell, Risley, Windscale and Winfrith … UKAEA is already in the process of selling surplus land at Risley for redevelopment and it is basically agreed that those parts of the site housing AEA Technology facilities and the headquarters of the consultancy service business should transfer to AEA Technology. Following privatisation this will effectively mean the end of the UKAEA presence at Risley. No
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
decisions have been taken, however, about the other possibilities for transfer to AEA Technology—ie the non-JET half of Culham, the unlicensed part of the Winfrith site and the unlicensed areas at Harwell. The Government has no objection in principle to any land being transferred provided it represents value to the tax payer."</p></blockquote>
That sets out the position clearly. His letter added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The UKAEA holds the freehold of each of the four sites where a freehold transfer is being considered and we do not anticipate there would be any inordinate problems arising from the transfer of land titles."</p></blockquote>
I notice the use of the word "inordinate". I am happy that the problems will not be inordinate—although I would be much happier if there were no problems at all. That is why I tabled the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government intend to transfer property to the successor company, it is incumbent on them to ensure that that property with a good title. That is why we proposed the insertion of "shall provide" instead of "may provide".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would change the power of the authority and the transferee to issue a joint certificate relating to the vesting of property under a transfer scheme into a duty. That is unnecessary. A certificate is needed only if one party requires it to provide a third party with evidence of title. The power to issue a certificate is sufficient for that purpose—it does not need to be made into a duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the event of the authority and the transferee not being able to agree on the effect of a transfer and thus the terms of a certificate, sub-paragraph (2) already imposes a duty—the cover sought by the hon. Gentleman—to refer the matter to the Secretary of State and to issue a certificate on such terms as he might direct. I understand the reasoning behind the amendment, but it is unnecessary and I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. In view of his assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 11, leave out from end of line 44 to end of line 33 on page 12. The amendment is intended to tease out from the Minister more information on foreign property holdings and to satisfy my insatiable curiosity on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 7 imposes on the authority a duty
	<br><blockquote><p>"to take all such steps as may be requisite to secure that the vesting in the transferee, in accordance with the scheme, of the foreign property, right or liability is effective under the relevant foreign law."</p></blockquote>
One hopes that too many properties are not involved, or else somebody will have a great deal of work. Someone in the Department will have to brush up on international
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
property law. It is a long and complicated section of the schedule with many references to foreign property, expenses incurred and so on. I shall not go into unnecessary length in analysing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will be grateful if the Minister would let us know what foreign property holdings are being talked about. Do such holdings refer purely to current AEA activities being developed abroad, or do they refer, for example, to former nuclear sites owned by the British Government? I would not like to think of Bikini atoll or parts of the Marshall islands being involved in British nuclear industries. I also recall large chunks of the central Australian desert—high quality real estate such as that—being involved. Would the Minister explain briefly what he means? I am sure that we shall be satisfied with his response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add to my hon. Friend's request for further clarification from the Minister. It would be helpful to know whether relevant foreign properties are in European Union countries or any of their dominions, and also what effect that might have on any transactions that might arise from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a long history of debates about nuclear matters and some of the Minister's more Europhobic colleagues have entered the fray. My questions are not from that perspective but in the interests of the Committee. There could be complicated transactions if European properties were involved. There are many joint activities relating to atomic nuclear energy policy development and nuclear physics in which the AEA is involved. We are not dealing with the electricity interconnector but one wonders, if we were, where the line would be drawn for that—halfway across the channel, I guess. There must be several similar examples where the picture is not entirely clear from the information before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure both hon. Gentlemans that there is no passing of great chunks of radioactive land or activities of that nature. AEA Technology has, quite correctly, embarked on an intensive marketing campaign to try to bring its expertise and knowledge to the world's attention. It has established several offices around the world to be closer to its markets and so that its staff can go forth more positively and eulogise over the advantages of doing business with AEA Technology. Some of those offices are leasehold, but I believe that one in the United States has a freehold. Part of the reasoning behind the fairly standard paragraph 7 is to enable that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove paragraph 7, which relates to foreign property. If it were accepted, it would prevent the effective vesting in a successor company of any of the authority's foreign property, thus ensuring that it remained with Government division. The provisions of paragraph 7 are necessary to deal with property, rights and liabilities that may not vest under foreign law by virtue of the transfer scheme provision—that relates to the point made by the hon. Member for Ellemere Port and Neston. The provisions follow well-established precedents in other privatisation legislation and are needed because the authority owns foreign property and has contracts with
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
persons overseas. They exist to ensure that the transfer of title to foreign property is effective under foreign law and to provide a process to resolve disputes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment's intention is to prevent the transfer of foreign property, it will not achieve that. The provisions do not affect the transfer of beneficial title to foreign property for the purpose of British law. Their purpose is simply to make clear who has the responsibility for which task in relation to perfecting the transfer under foreign law. The amendment would complicate what should be a relatively straightforward process. Therefore, I ask the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the assurances provided by the Minister and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of amendments Nos. 20 and 21 is to provide a duty for the Secretary of State to consult staff about any transfer scheme rather than simply giving notice of proposals.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Transfer or Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 came into force between February and May 1982 and the debate on Second Reading, which took place on 7 December 1981, provided some insight into Government thinking. It is interesting that Government Members who were involved in that provision keep cropping up during today's deliberations. In fact, the Under-Secretary of State for Industry and Energy will be mentioned later in my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the regulations were presented, the then Under-Secretary of State for Employment said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The regulations have two main provisions. First, when there is a change of employer they provide for an automatic transfer of the employees along with the business. I emphasise the words 'a change of employer', which mean where the identity of the employing company changes. The regulations do not apply to a change of ownership where only the controlling shares in the company change hands. Hon. Members will appreciate that at present, if a business is sold as a going concern, the contracts of employment are normally brought to an end. That will no longer be the case.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>Secondly, the regulations provide for recognised trade unions to be given information concerning the transfer by both the buyer and the seller and to be consulted about any measures that the buyer or seller intends to take in connection with the transfer."</p></blockquote>
We heard in earlier debates that the Government are as yet uncertain as to how the company will be disposed of. Indeed, specific paragraphs of the Government's published guide to market testing refer to cases where it is unclear at the outset whether the TUPE regulations apply. It may be that, in the context of this debate, the Government need to refer carefully to those paragraphs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard also how highly the work force is regarded. We were told that the company could, in part, be subject to takeover by companies that are quoted on stock exchanges outside the UK, and we heard, as the Bill explicitly states, that the TUPE regulations should apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Under-Secretary of State spoke to the TUPE regulations, he said also:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regulation 3 defines the scope of the regulations and makes it clear that they do not apply when all that is being transferred is the shareholding in a company. They apply only where there is a legal change of employer and where, immediately before the transfer, the undertaking is situated in the United Kingdom."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 7 December 1981; Vol. 14, c. 677.]</p></blockquote>
Given that we do not yet know how the company is to be disposed of, and given the various possibilities allowed by potential interpretations of TUPE, the schedule in its current form is, in my view, inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 10 of TUPE provides a duty to inform and to consult with trade union representatives, and regulation 10(2) sets that out in some detail. Given that schedule 1(9) of the Bill refers directly to TUPE, it is my contention that the Government's wording is inconsistent and that they should include the amendments. TUPE specifically includes consultation, whereas the Government's draft leaves it unsaid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are serious in their praise of the work force and are prepared, in certain circumstances, to entertain an employee-management buy-out of some or all of the company, they should go much further than the basic requirements of TUPE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will deal with pension matters later, but any proposals should be akin to the Dutch interpretation of the TUPE principles. Maximum information should be provided to the work force through recognised organisations prior to any irreconcilable decisions being taken so that they can either present the management with arguments on why that route is not sensible or take the course that seems to have support of both sides of the House and find a formula by which an employee buy-out of the company could work properly. Those principles have applied in other countries, but when disposing of public assets in this country we have not gone far enough and have not given the work force the best opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
When the TUPE regulations were presented, several hon. Members, perhaps for different reasons, were concerned about the member. I suspect that the principal objection to TUPE of the hon. Member for Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) was that the regulations emanated from across the water in Brussels. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Is that not a desperately important and significant change in the law? Does it not mean that if there is a transfer of ownership, the firm taking over another firm—which may have been in trouble because of bad trade union practices—must take over all wage procedure agreements and be legally liable for any consequences? Does not the Minister think that that is a massive change in the law for British companies? What on earth is it doing in a regulation?"</p></blockquote>
Perhaps I will not comment on the hon. Member's views on matters European, but in the context of this Bill no such issue arises—quite the contrary. The Government and the management have praised the work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, the hon. Member for Surrey, North-West (Sir M. Grylls) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Reverting to trade union agreements, my hon. and learned Friend referred to collective agreements not being enforceable. What would be the position of a closed shop being taken over in this way?"—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 7 December 1981; Vol. 14, c. 679–680.]</p></blockquote>
Again, we are not in that situation. Well-ordered and structured systems of recognition have been in place for a good number of years. Many people in the establishment to which the Bill refers are members of trade unions. The fears of the hon. Member for Surrey, North-West would not come into play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would a literal interpretation of TUPE provide? It is simply a limited right of consultation. I hope that the Government will agree to the amendment, which would make schedule 1 consistent with the TUPE wording. Also, I hope that the Government will make it clear that much more is expected. The Minister for Energy and Industry said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"AEA Technology will thrive if it can bring to bear the expertise that it has established from the tremendous residual effect of 40 years of high-class science and engineering and apply that in a more rigorous way to the commercial opportunities that exist."</p></blockquote>
That can only be achieved if the work force are confident and of high morale through sales being consistent with the overwhelming opinion in the company. The Minister for Energy and Industry went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I naturally attach a great deal of weight to the views of management and staff. They are the people who know the business and whose commitment is crucial to realising its potential."—[	<i>Official Report.</i> 14 March 1995; Vol. 256, c. 704–706.]</p></blockquote>
If the Government are clear about that, they must give those people every possible tool to ensure that the company in the form envisaged by the Government—even though we do not know all the details yet—can be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will accept these modest
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
amendments, which will make the Bill conform to the TUPE regulations' formal requirements to consult. Omission of such requirements would make it possible to infer that the Government want to water down the TUPE regulations. That might please the hon. Member for Southend, East, but it would not help in the context of the Bill. As the Minister for Energy and Industry was right to say, the people in the industry are most important. We should give them confidence. To that end, the Minister should say without equivocation that he will accept the amendments and ensure that the people-centred operation is handled by the Department in such a way that employees' morale and confidence remains high.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spencer Batiste 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Elmet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment relates to the need to consult widely over the meaning of TUPE in the context of the transfer of assets. One of the few TUPE-related matters that is clear is that its impact is sometimes uncertain. That is a consequence of imposing a European-designed structure on a legal system that is constructed differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will ensure that any scheme of transfer will incorporate insurance arrangements covering present liabilities over torts and that the successor company will have adequate insurance policies to protect people in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to emphasise the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston and to discover why the Bill omits provision for consultation. I support the amendment because it would make such provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are aware of the difficulties in the Conservative party concerning trade unions and collective responsibility, whether in a European or domestic context. Some Conservative Members seem to be opposed to collective representation per se and to think that the master-servant relationship is the only one that should exist in the workplace. Some Conservative Members appear not to understand the workplace, while others take a more pragmatic view of the positive role of trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those are the reasons for the current wording of the Bill and for the lack of any measures on consultation, I am sure that the Minister will find ways to avoid admitting it. We must, however, be told the reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are good grounds for including a commitment to consultation. Everyone surely accepts that the industry depends almost entirely on the quality and skills of its staff. In my dealings with the nuclear energy industry and the AEA, I have always found that the trade unions have played a very supportive and constructive role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston said, regulation 10 of TUPE requires that people be informed and consulted. The transitional arrangements that will exist during the transfer to the private sector will cause much uncertainty and concern among staff, yet the success
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
of those arrangements and of companies will depend on those very people. If the Government want companies to be successful, they must allay those concerns. People will be worried about their pensions, the terms and conditions under which they work and about their security of employment. It is entirely natural for people to have such concerns when change is imposed on their employers. If we want to keep together the body of expertise that exists in the industry, we must make it clear that individuals and trade union organisations will be fully consulted on any proposed changes affecting the work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason for the Minister not to accept the amendment and not to include a requirement to consult in the Bill. That would be a positive step and would help to allay fears and feelings of uncertainty. Given the way in which collective agreements have worked in the past, there is no reason, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston said, for anyone to doubt that trade unions have played a positive role in representing their members and in ensuring the success of the AEA. They will continue to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.David Rendel 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support much of what Opposition Members have said. The amendment must be in the Government's interests. The Government are not known for their willingness to consult rather than inform, but I hope that in this instance they will accept the amendment. It has surely become clear that one of the most dangerous aspects of the process is the real potential for staff disaffection of one sort or another. We have already seen evidence of that in the statements that staff have passed to members of the Committee about what they do or do not want to happen. It must be in the Government's best interest to make sure that that staff disaffection is reduced as far as possible; one way of getting the staff's support is to ensure that they are fully consulted and not merely informed about proposals.

I do not see how any harm could be caused to the Government—or indeed to the national interest—by consulting the staff about what is to happen to them, and I cannot see any reason why the Government should hesitate to allow the amendment to go through. However, on behalf of some of my constituents who are members of staff at Harwell—some of whom are heavily involved in union affairs there—I would add that one of the most important ways in which property consultation can aid staff is by enabling them to find out what their likely long-term futures are, so that they can make sensible decisions about whether they should remain as employees on that site. They have to answer important questions about how their skills can best be used: not only on their behalf, but as I said in last Thursday's sitting, on behalf of the country as a whole. If those issues can be properly aired as a result of consultation, that must be not only in the interests of the Government and of the AEA, but in the interests of the nation. The Government should therefore accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee speaks with a united voice about the value of the staff to AEA Technology. It is without doubt a people's business. Of all the privatisations, with the possible exception of Amershan International, this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
is the one in which the staff have figured most importantly in the equation; they are the business and without them there would be little left. Opposition Members have spoken to that effect; they will know that those sitting behind me—with the exception of my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet (Mr. Batiste), who has an individual line on most matters—are bound by a Trappist vow of silence during the Committee's proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must resist the blandishments of the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, in which he was supported by the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel), to outline the route ahead. We will come to that at a later stage; my response then will be similar to my response on Second Reading. However, I do not blame the hon. Gentleman for asking and I am sure that he will equally understand my reluctance to give in to his blandishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Elmet raised the important matter of cover insurance; such insurance is not relevant for that part of TUPE but, in any case, AEA Technology already has adequate insurance provisions. It will be up to the Secretary of State to consider; when an application for the changing status of AEA Technology is made—in whatever shape or form—he will have to satisfy himself that the sort of liabilities to which my hon. Friend referred are adequately covered. We do not wish AEA Technology to go into that new phase unprotected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raised that point because of a recent case in the High Court which suggested that tortious liabilities relating to employees may be passed on as part of the overall TUPE package. In such circumstances, it is of vital importance that proper insurance cover be in place to fill any gaps in liabilities that might open up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend. That will obviously now be emphasised and doubly examined when the change to AEA Technology's status is considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to return to the main issue, which the hon. Gentleman was right to raise. It is important to put on record the various arrangements relating to TUPE. However, this is not the first privatisation: some industries have already gone down that road, so it is a well proven route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 would place an express requirement on the Secretary of State to consult the unions and other bodies representing the staff of the authority before directing the authority to make any transfer scheme. This part of the Bill is complex, so it might be helpful to explain in lay terms what paragraph 9 is intended to achieve. I shall then explain how the amendments would work in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members know, TUPE regulations apply automatically to any transfer of an undertaking, including the type of transfer envisaged in the Bill. In broad terms, TUPE provides that staff transferred as part of the undertaking to a new employer will become employees of the new employer under the same terms and conditions as
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
they enjoyed before the transfer. TUPE also provides for consultation between management and the unions before the transfer takes place. Under TUPE, the employer is required to tell unions that a transfer is about to take place. Reasons for the transfer are explained, as are the legal, economic and social implications for employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 9 does two things. First, it confirms, for the avoidance of doubt, that TUPE will apply to any transfers carried out under the Bill. That is desirable because, as a result of the way in which the scheme-making powers work, the Secretary of State could in certain circumstances be deemed the transferor, whereas it is clearly right that the TUPE obligations should fall on the authority as employer. Secondly, since it is the Secretary of State, not the employer, who initiates the scheme-making process, it puts a duty on the Secretary of State to tell the authority when he is about to give it a direction to make a scheme, so that the employer can begin the consultation required under TUPE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would impose an obligation on the Secretary of State to consult staff and unions at the same point in time at which he was giving the authority notice to enable it to begin the TUPE process. It therefore adds little to the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For clarity, the amendment would make the wording read,
	<br><blockquote><p>"and consult with such persons as he considers appropriate".</p></blockquote>
The timing is not specified, but the spirit of the amendment would lead one to expect that the Secretary of State would consult at an early stage to enable considerations such as an employee buy-out to be a viable possibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are running the risk of involving the Secretary of State in what should be an employer-employee or union relationship. The decision making, negotiation and consultation should be between those parties—they are not matters for the Secretary of State. I understand what the hon. Gentleman is hoping to achieve, but the amendment adds little to the protection already available under TUPE. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entirely clear about what the hon. Gentleman wants to achieve with amendment No. 15. Clause 2 obliges the Secretary of State to consult the authority in only a narrow range of circumstances—namely, when he proposes to decline to approve a transfer scheme or to modify or make such a scheme himself—for the obvious reason that if he intends to reject the authority's proposal he should let it know beforehand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require consultation in only those circumstances, whereas I assume that the hon. Gentleman's intention is to provide an automatic right of consultation before the Secretary of State approved any scheme. The amendment could, of course, be tidied up to achieve that effect.

	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
I return to the general issue to which the amendment gives rise. It is the Government's view that the right people to manage the business are the managers. It is for the management to consult the staff; it is not appropriate for Government to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is designed to achieve consultation at the appropriate level. Surely, with ownership—which is still vested in the Government—go certain responsibilities. We do not want the Secretary of State to be dragged into every little detail of the relationship between the trade union and management in the Atomic Energy Authority, but when he is to approve a major transfer that could have significant consequences on the terms and conditions and the security of employees, he or his representative should have some responsibility for consulting the people who will be affected. What we are trying to achieve is appropriate consultation at an appropriate level in each individual circumstance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not quite understand the way in which TUPE works. Whatever scheme comes along, liability for employees is automatically transferred, otherwise the employee could regard it as constructive dismissal and could take appropriate action. We are underestimating the role of AEA Technology management. It is committed to a full programme of consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 15 does not challenge the role of AEA Technology. Clause 2(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may from time to time direct the Authority to make, before a date specified in the direction, a transfer scheme which relates to such property".</p></blockquote>
Clause 1(7) says that the Secretary of State "shall consult the Authority". The amendment seeks to pin down the Secretary of State and require him to involve the people who are important to this operation when he consults on matters that impinge on them. What is wrong with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It comes back to the point I made at our first sitting. There is a difference in philosophy and approach on this matter. The Secretary of State rightly leaves the consultation and decision-making process to the management and staff and does not feel that it is right for him to be pinned down as the hon. Gentleman suggests. I understand why the hon. Gentleman takes that view, because that has been the traditional view underlying the philosophy of the Labour party. I happen to disagree. I will make a couple of points to make to allay a little of the concern that no consultation is taking place. So far, as I understand it, the chief executive of AEA Technology made 18 presentations to 2,500 staff. The programme will be repeated at regular intervals and at important decision points. It is for AEA Technology's management to consult with staff and to reflect their views in any proposals that might be put to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that, in any case, the authority will have a duty under the TUPE regulations to consult staff and their representative organisations. The TUPE
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
provisions provide adequate statutory protection and I see no reason to add to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try to put this as simply as I can. We want management to consult when it takes decisions and the Secretary of State to consult when he takes decisions. There is no point in trade union representatives or anyone else consulting people who are not taking the decisions about which they want to be consulted. That should be apparent to the Minister as it is to anyone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, the authority has a duty under the TUPE regulations to consult staff and their representative organisations. The authority will, therefore, consult. That will be the method through which the Secretary of State would be appraised of the staff's views. For that reason, I urge that the amendment be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government appear to be taking an inconsistent line. There is praise for the staff and clear statements about their importance. Presumably, the Minister agrees that key to the success of any transfer would be to carry the largest number of staff forward into the new operation at a high level of morale and confidence. Surely the Minister would absolutely agree that the transfer must take place in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Elmet is right that certain aspects of the TUPE regulations leave much to be desired in terms of clarity. Certain of those regulations would never win the plain English award.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must reflect on certain issues. There are circumstances in which the Government have, by their own decision, put the TUPE regulations at the top of their list. I referred earlier to the "Governments Guide to Market Testing", published by the Cabinet Office. On page 29 of that guide, in the commentary alongside paragraphs relating to the handling of cases where it is unclear at the outset whether the TUPE regulations will apply, the Government state positively:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Since whether or not the TUPE regulations applies will depend on the specific details of the particular bid, departments and agencies should make this clear to staff and the TUs, but undertake consultations on a basis which would satisfy the TUPE requirements should the regulations prove to apply.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is the Government's policy not to give indemnities except where these are specifically provided for in statute".</p></blockquote>
That answers the question posed by the hon. Member for Elmet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first part of that quote sets out precisely Government policy where they are not sure whether the TUPE regulations will apply. The Minister said that he believes that the TUPE regulations will apply in any sale affecting the Atomic Energy Authority and that we should go on from there. However, if the regulations are to apply, the duty to consult arises. Clearly, the Minister wishes to pass that responsibility to the company's management. I agree completely that the Minister is not the appropriate person to be involved in the day-to-day running of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
company's affairs. I do not know his skills background, but I suspect that he would agree that he would not be the best person to run that company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are talking not about the norm of day-today company management but about a quantum leap into the unknown. The Government have yet to define the company's structure and the people to whom the company will be sold, who could come from other countries. The role of the Secretary of State is crucial. He should consult with the key people involved in the enterprise—the staff—to whose confidence, morale, enthusiasm and staying power the Minister is so keen to refer. If the Minister does not accept these modest amendments, it will not be clear that he takes the staff seriously. They should be involved in such consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting series of debates on some important matters. I am grateful to the Minister for his clarification of some questions but disappointed with his refusal to allow staff to be consulted. The amendments to that effect were perfectly reasonable, and the Minister's refusal to accept them shows the Government's lack of awareness of what it is that Opposition Members are trying to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may raise a further point with the Minister. I had hoped that he would answer it earlier, but due to a slight technical confusion, I sat down before he was able to do so. I shall take him back to the matter of the security control of persons operating, using or handling nuclear materials. Will the Minister say—if he is able—whether security clearance and vetting will be required for such employees, whether it is required now and whether it will be required in any successive companies? It is important that the matter is clarified, and the Minister will save us returning to the matter in the future if he gives us an answer now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have difficulty in giving the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy the full answer that he requires.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows that anyone who undertakes that type of work has to sign the Official Secrets Act 1911. The individual would thus incur that responsibility and liability. It is a matter of extreme sensitivity, but at the end of the day, we rely on the individual's conscience and thought as to how he or she behaves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister trying to suggest that if someone has signed the Official Secrets Act 1911, the British Government would stand back and allow him to go if the Government of Iraq decided to employ him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

The answer to his question is obviously not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston said: in any proposal, we have to carry the hearts and minds of the people who work at AEA Technology. Not to do so would be not only wrong but financially stupid. The hon. Gentleman, however, was slightly disingenuous when he said, "The Minister thinks that the TUPE regulations are going to apply." I want to make it clear to the Committee that those regulations will apply to any transfer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No.14, in page 2, line 38, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'6(A) The Secretary of State shall not approve or make a transfer scheme unless a draft of such a scheme has been laid before both Houses of Parliament and approved by resolution of both Houses'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment is designed to secure the democratic right of the legislature to inspect and to decide on proposals. Much has been said about the rights and wrongs of enabling legislation, and we should be especially concerned about its role here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's proposals are vague. That is not his fault—the Bill was introduced before detailed plans were made. The reasons for that go far beyond the issues of atomic energy and energy policy and have more to do with the Government's overall legislation programme and with the collapse of Post Office privatisation. The Minister is in the unfortunate situation of having to front up the ongoing drive towards privatisation without any sensible and detailed plans being in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has been dragged to the front of the Government's schedule for reasons that have little to do with energy policy. The Minister cannot, therefore, tell the Committee what he intends to do with the Atomic Energy Authority. It would be wrong to enable him to go ahead with transfers without the specific approval of Parliament for his plans—when he eventually has some.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are grave concerns about transfer schemes throughout the country. People are rightly concerned about the unbridled power the Executive has under the Government because it does not lead to good legislation. There are myriad examples of proposals that were not as good as they could have been because legislation was not properly scrutinised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Ottaway 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Committee offers the chance for such scrutiny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If members of the Committee doubt that such scrutiny has been lacking, they should think about the poll tax or look in their post bags, which are probably full of letters about the Child Support Agency. We continually fall into this trap. People ask me, "How on earth could you sit there as a Member of Parliament and agree to such nonsense?" When I say that I did not and that a measure was introduced by a Minister through enabling legislation and without proper scrutiny, they are amazed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should all be concerned that Parliament's ability to scrutinise measures and hold the Executive to account has been eroded. Many Conservative Members privately agree with that view. The consequence of that lack of scrutiny is that the media—the fourth estate—is sometimes more effective at holding the Executive to account than the House, with all the ramifications that flow from that. We should insist on the clause to ensure details of transfers come back to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
Many of my hon. Friends are confidently expecting to be sitting on the other side of the Chamber soon. Perhaps we should continue certain practices so that we can participate in similar abuses of the parliamentary system when we embark on our legislative programme. However, the overwhelming majority of my hon. Friends want a Labour Government to carry things out differently from the present Government. We do not want to fall into bad habits that have evolved over a long time. We seek to strengthen parliamentary scrutiny over legislation, irrespective of the change in our circumstances to which we are looking forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the amendment will be accepted and that we shall be given opportunities to scrutinise properly the transfers as they come forward. Parts of the Bill are vague, for reasons outside the Minister's hands—which reinforces the argument for regulations to return for scrutiny by both Houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East spelt out the ramifications of the clause. I remember one of the quirks in our party's history, when we were dealing with troublesome Members of Parliament who have since left us. Often they held the view that it was appropriate to introduce a clause that gave the Secretary of State the power to do anything he wanted to. My fear is that this might be described as the Militant Tendency clause on behalf of the Secretary of State. Opposition Members are merely trying to introduce some element of democratic control over him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of different views are held about the best structure for a privatised company. Others believe that the company should not be privatised. This is no new debate—the House has been debating the issue since 1981. I referred earlier to the words of the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North in a debate that year. Responding to the late David Penhaligon who was suggesting tongue in cheek that the Government were about to sell the lot, the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, North said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should keep an interest in the Atomic Energy Authority because I think that it is important that we should do so, but I should be prepared to dispose of those companies—BNFL, NNC and the Radiochemical Centre Ltd."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 10 February 1981; Vol. 998, c. 768.]</p></blockquote>
Different views persist throughout the House, which are not always simple party political divisions. On Second Reading, some hon. Members dealt with the nature of the transfer—that it should relate to one single part. It cannot be assumed that any transfer dreamt up by the Secretary of State will be acceptable to majority opinion in the House. On that basis, it is simply the proper application of democratic principles to insist that the Secretary of State bring any transfer back to the Floor of the House to ensure that differing views can be explored and that the final product is in the national interest. Again, that national interest will undoubtedly be described in terms of the way in which the staff and the management of the company respond. I support my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East and I hope that the Government will see the sense of the amendment; if they do not, the doors
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Mr. Hill, for the appearance of my thumb—a mute testimony to the sharpness of Japanese cooking knives.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall add a few words—in order, rather than out of it—to back up my hon. Friends. We are talking about a matter of principle and detail. As a principle, we are looking at the way in which the Government—and by the Government I mean the Executive—have gradually eroded the rights of Parliament to scrutinise legislation. That is a matter for hon. Members on all sides of the House—it is as important for a Conservative Back Bencher as it is for any Labour Member to be able to make proper scrutiny of anything done by the Executive. As we see in many other walks of life, attempts are continually made to frustrate proper scrutiny—and the tendency toward that abuse of the prerogative of office in order to frustrate proper channels of accountability must be recognised. As my hon. Friends, half facetiously, pointed out, it would be just as prevalent if we and the Governments exchanged sides; it could well be the Minister standing up and criticising me for doing exactly the same thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am cut to the core by the suggestion that I and my hon. Friends were being facetious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my hon. Friend. I do not like to suggest that he was being facetious. However, it would be just as great a temptation for us, in the same circumstances, to attempt to short-circuit matters and to avoid scrutiny to get things done in a largely underhand way, without anyone having a proper say. In principle, that is wrong and I hope that when, in the not too distant future, our roles are reversed, I will resist the temptation to do likewise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are always interested in collecting manifesto commitments from the Opposition, on the off-chance that they might one day be in a position to implement them.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know about that. I do not think that we would want to waste the manifesto by putting in such a clause since most of the public would not have a clue what we were talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Willetts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Havant)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was just trying to work out the significance of that Government "Ah!". If the hon. Gentleman distracts me again, I may be tempted to bring up some of the work he did, in a previous existence, on the health service, so that I can interject—but that would of course be out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not remove rights from Parliament to scrutinise legislation. Over the past 15 years, the volume of secondary legislation has increased. It has become normal practice to outline a Bill on Second Reading, to go through it quickly in Committee, to get it enacted and thereafter to have a raft of orders as the Government gradually work out what they mean. I do not know whether that is because of indecent haste in putting legislation on to the statute book. The Government get ahead of themselves and then go back and find that they are not sure about it. That is, at least, a proper way of using orders. Alternatively, it might be a deliberate attempt to circumvent proper scrutiny by Parliament. Matters have now gone a stage further: We are not going to have even secondary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill gives the Government carte blanche to do exactly what they like: to sell off any bits of AEA Technology that they want, in any way, with no regard other than that which they put—in our view, inadequately—in the Bill. It is not as though the Government need to circumvent Parliament. There is adequate time available in this and, I suspect, in the next Session to give long and detailed scrutiny to any attempt to sell off parts of AEA Technology. The Government have run out of ideas, which is clear from the paucity of primary legislation before us; I thought that they would jump at the chance to spend a day or two in Parliament considering matters such as this and giving Back Benchers a chance to examine them in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, the issue does not concern only the Opposition. Some Conservative Members have direct constituency interests in the matter. For example, the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Jackson) has been despicably deprived of his chance to serve on the Committee and to speak on behalf of his constituents—I am sure that he would have done that eloquently. Will he have no opportunity, other than a brief chance on Report, to say anything about the future? If so, that is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is obviously raising valid concerns but it is open to the Labour party to raise the issue on an Opposition Supply day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is being disingenuous. She knows that the Labour party might want to raise the matter on an Opposition Supply day, but that would not give us the opportunity to say yea or nay to the decision on this legislation. It would allow us merely to condemn what had been going on, but it would not give us a real chance to scrutinise legislation. That tendency in the Government should be reversed and substituted with the opportunity for adequate discussion on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen many examples of such a tendency in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
Department of Trade and Industry in the past year or two. The privatisation and sell-off of the laboratory of Government chemists, the takeover of the National Physical Laboratory, last year's incorporation of Warren Spring laboratory into AEA Technology, and the putative sale of the national engineering laboratory in East Kilbride are all matters about which the Government no longer feel obliged to subject themselves to detailed scrutiny. On those grounds, the amendment is essential for us to ensure that there is proper discussion in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of our detailed concerns relate to the handling of special nuclear materials, to the special, sometimes sensitive, skills of the work force, to the rights of the work force under TUPE to have their interests safeguarded, and to the national interest in the privatisation of such an important concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want Conservative Members to think that Opposition Members are merely making speeches that criticise the privatisation of this particular industry just because it is being privatised. We are not simply saying that public is good and private is bad; that is not the issue. We have genuine concerns, which we discussed at great length on Second Reading, about why AEA Technology should remain in the public sector. We think that our reasons are valid and that the Government should think again if the privatisation method that is chosen appears to be inadequate in any of the many areas that I have mentioned. On those grounds, I support my hon. Friend's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee know that I came only recently to the Department of Trade and Industry, so the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East is right in saying that I have been landed with the Bill. Having been landed with it as I walked through the departmental entrance, I have to say that I have studied it and believe that the policy we are advocating is the right one to adopt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke on a broad policy basis. He said that he wanted further scrutiny by Parliament and that was enthusiastically endorsed by the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy. I have a horrible feeling that their remarks will come back to haunt them in the fullness of time. I also noticed how quickly that train hit the buffers—my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet asked whether that was Labour party policy and suddenly we heard the screeching of brakes and the whole show came to a halt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refute what the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy said. He measures virility by the quantity of primary legislation. That is redolent of the old television programme "Never mind the quality, feel the width." I suggest that the sign of a Government's success is the quality of legislation and administration and not the sheer volume that is pushed through the sausage machine. I am sure that you would bring me to order, Mr. Hill, were I to continue on that theme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendment is immediately obvious. Not all amendments tied to the drafting of a Bill are obvious, but this one is. It would prevent the Secretary of
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
State from approving or making a transfer scheme unless it had the approval of both Houses of Parliament. It would provide both Houses with an opportunity to approve a draft of the scheme, but would not remove the Secretary of State's final say over whether or not the scheme was approved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the arguments that have been made in favour of the amendment because they are self-evident, but I do not believe that it is in the best interests of AEA Technology or the taxpayer. I would like the Committee to consider the possible implications if the amendment were accepted, bearing in mind that a transfer scheme might not be made until the point of sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone in business knows that it is often necessary to move quickly to close a deal in response to changing market conditions. The amendment could make for delay while debates in both Houses took place. That might take only a few days, but if Parliament were in recess it could take many months. Either way, a delay could easily cause a sale to fall through or reduce proceeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, potential trade purchasers might be deterred from bidding if they knew that their bids would be subject to public scrutiny even before the sale was completed. Even if bidders were not deterred, any sale could be held up pending completion of the parliamentary process. It might only be possible to explain a preference for one bidder over another by revealing sensitive information that a bidder would not want to be revealed for good commercial reasons. It might also not be in the taxpayer's interests to disclose details of competing bids, as that knowledge might cause the lead bidder to reduce the value of his offer or to back out of the purchase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me remind the Minister of exactly what the amendment says.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shall not approve or make a transfer scheme unless a draft of such a scheme has been laid before both Houses of Parliament".</p></blockquote>
We have discussed methods of sale, be it to the work force, a trade sale or a transfer. We propose that the chosen methods of sale—not the sale itself—should be subjected to agreement by both Houses of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the amendment were approved, a transfer scheme would have to go through the parliamentary process and would have to be approved by both Houses of Parliament, with all the delays and consequences that I have mentioned. The amendment would jeopardise the Government's position and their ability to safeguard the taxpayer's interests. It is certainly not in the public interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fail to understand the circumstances that the Minister is describing. We are dealing with an important research institution that undertakes valuable work for the nation. Surely the Government will not flog it off to some fly-by-night outfit that might disappear tomorrow. The only potential sale will be to a stable, highly reputable group of people—either the work force or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
a newly founded company stemming from the work force or an existing, highly reputable organisation. Can the Minister describe which "changing circumstances"—which will arise as the matter goes through Parliament—would jeopardise such a sale?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly surprised by that question because if one of the options was deemed to be the best one—I do not want to say any more than that it is one of several—and we were undertaking a trade sale, several organisations would put in to purchase AEA Technology. Those bids would have to be evaluated; they might well include highly commercial and confidential information that would accurately embarrass or annoy the organisations were it to become public. If such information as would be drawn out through the parliamentary process to become public, it could compromise or jeopardise organisations' financial abilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A good example of precisely the circumstances that my hon. Friend the Minister described is the sale of royal ordnance. The preferred route of a sale of shares—a flotation—collapsed at the very last moment and the business would have been severely jeopardised had not the Government been able to move rapidly with trade sales to different purchasers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend offered a valid example of the flexibility that is necessary in such instances. I assure the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston that when that route is taken, flexibility and speed need to be at one's disposal. I promise that not all the procedures that go through the House, no matter how rapidly they can be dealt with, can be finalised in a couple of days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not understand that there is a fundamental difference between the sale of a manufacturing operation and the sale of a research institution with a commercial service at the end of it? It not is likely that the sale, if it goes through, will leave us faced with the same circumstances as the hon. Member for Elmet described? Does the Minister agree that the circumstances are different and special? Against that background, he should reconsider his attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not appreciate the workings of the commercial world in this sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not understand the workings of science.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hang on. Just you relax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly relaxed, thank you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that has been one of your endearing characteristics during the Committee's sittings, Mr. Hill. You have watched our shenanigans and have been completely at ease throughout. For that, I am grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
You were quite right, Mr. Hill, to point out that I should have referred to the hon. Gentleman as the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston. He and I shall disagree about commercial confidentiality and flexibility. I understand why the hon. Gentleman tabled the amendment. He might not accept my reasons for refusing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To bring my remarks to a close, we have repeatedly made clear what will happen, which is why we need flexibility. What will happen depends crucially on AEA Technology during the next few months. I said it before and I say it again—I make no apology. It is too soon to close off our options. The amendments do not serve the public interest, and I hope that the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A couple of contributions from Conservative Members deserve comment. The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) said that we could scrutinise a proposal on an Opposition day. That is hardly a serious suggestion. I am sure that she would privately recognise the need to strengthen scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) made a sedentary intervention—it should be highlighted because it was his only contribution today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ottaway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having been in Opposition for so long, the hon. Gentleman will be utterly unaware that Parliamentary Private Secretaries from the Department that introduces a Bill do not traditionally speak in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not have responded, then. I believe that the hon. Member said that this is our chance to scrutinise the Bill. That is not the case, however. There are no proposals for us to scrutinise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that scrutiny would have to take place within a short time of a bid, having been made because that is the way that commercial transactions work. That would have the opposite effect to that which he and his hon. Friends seek. The company would be more likely to be broken into small bits, and he would not want that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are suggesting that drafts of proposed transfers should be considered by both Houses. That is not impractical. If the Government make it clear that they are prepared to implement procedures that would allow scrutiny of transfers to take place, we might not press the amendment. Similarly, we might not press it if the Minister accepts that the development of Government policy is at an early stage and that we cannot, therefore, scrutinise proposals. The Minister has not done that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman obviously does not recognise the importance of his amendment. If the procedure is sufficiently detailed, it can take place only when commercial negotiations are almost completed. The company will then either be broken up or sold at discount, and the taxpayer will be penalised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not be too led, Mr. Ainsworth.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot believe that the hon.
