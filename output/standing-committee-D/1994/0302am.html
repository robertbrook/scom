	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sir George Young)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 204, in page 306, line 3, leave out "or" and insert "and".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a minor amendment to the provisions that set out the rights and responsibilities of branches and agents of non-residents under self-assessment. It corrects a drafting error in the definition of an independent agent. The definition was intended to require all three tests of legal, financial and commercial independence to be satisfied but, as drafted, any one of the three would have sufficed. The same definition is used in amendments Nos. 195 and 203, which would amend the provisions on investment managers acting for non-residents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Twenty-third schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hilary Armstrong 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Durham, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you can hear, Mr. Hogg, I am still not in full voice. I am sure that you are pleased to hear that, as it means that I shall not be tempted to speak at length. However, some points have been made about the schedule which I want to raise with the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule and associated clauses ensure that taxation relating to non-residents and those who are not treated as United Kingdom representatives is brought under self-assessment. Clause 113(2)(a) uses the word "indirectly", and the Faculty of Taxation is concerned that that might bring amounts that are presently exempt into tax liability or charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At issue is the technical wording. I do not pretend to be able to make expert comment, but the Faculty of Taxation raised the point with me. Words have been used in different ways throughout the Bill, which has led to Conservative Members expressing concerns about the wording of earlier parts of the Bill, and the Faculty of Taxation is worried about the word "indirectly". The Government should be clear about what that word means and should reassure us that additional amounts, which are currently exempt, will not be brought into tax liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society has commented on the wording in clause 113(5). I apologise for having to raise technicalities, but with such a schedule, we have to clarify precisely what the wording means. The Law Society is specifically worried about what is meant by the reference to where the branch or agency is carried on. It is not clear
	<span class='label label-info column'>542</span>
whether that is meant to refer to a trade carried on through a branch or agency. The Law Society would say that that wording is incorrect, although I would not go so far when commenting on the work of parliamentary draftspeople. The Law Society wants that wording clarified—it believes that the words' meaning is unclear and raises a problem. The Bill and, in particular, the schedules have left those who make their living by identifying and working with such complex legislation, uncertain about the meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chartered Institute of Taxation is concerned that a revised extra-statutory concession is needed to implement the commitment given by the Minister in the Inland Revenue's press release 31, which stated that existing arrangements may be continued in certain circumstances up to 5 April 2005. It believes that that commitment is not specifically addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Financial Secretary is able to respond to those three specific and technical points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising those technical issues. The schedule and the clause make no fundamental change to policy. We are trying to replace the present rules, which are antiquated and out of date, with rules that set out clearly the circumstances in which people in the United Kingdom are responsible for the tax affairs of non-residents and the extent of their responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issues raised by the hon. Lady have been through the self-assessment consultative committee. The schedule and the clause have been welcomed by bodies representing tax professionals as a long overdue simplification, modernisation and rationalisation of an important part of the tax code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the hon. Lady's first point, the new rules bring the definition of the profits for which the branch or agent is responsible—where the non-resident is an individual—into line with the existing rule for nonresident companies. Such profits are, broadly, the profits derived from or connected with the branch or agency. The wording used, which was introduced in 1965, is well understood and has worked well in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the concerns expressed by the Law Society, clause 113(5) confirms that a partnership can be the UK representative of a non-resident, for example when the non-resident trades in the UK through the partnership acting as agent for the non-resident. The wording ensures that the obligations and liabilities of the partners acting as UK representative of a non-resident fall on the partnership as a whole—jointly on the partners—and not separately, as with the liabilities in respect of profits of the partnership under self-assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady mentioned subsection 5. We do not think it will lead to understanding. The alternative wording suggested by the Law Society is longer and more complicated and we prefer the wording that we have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the Minister meant to say misunderstanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the wording will not lead to misunderstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady's final point referred to the press release and relates to the extra-statutory concession B40. The issue she raised was clarified in the Inland Revenue press release on 17 February on clause 114 and schedule 23.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0813">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
The new rules come into effect on 6 April 1995 and will replace existing rules from that date. In exceptional cases of arrangements which were set up before Budget day and under which income of non-residents would have been exempt from tax under ESC B40 but would not be exempt under the new provisions, ESC B40 will continue to apply for a limited period. The press release explained that it will continue to apply on the same basis as before—the concession as published will apply when it would have applied if the investment manager rules which were in force on Budget day had not been repealed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

They would replace the condition that the non-resident should not be the sole or main client of the investment manager, with the condition that the investment manager should be independent of the non-resident.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 197 to 200 and 202.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments relate to the provisions which limit the tax chargeable on nonresidents from transactions carried out through investment managers in the UK. The rules include anti-avoidance provisions which exclude financial trades carried out through investment managers from the limitation of charge if the investment manager and persons connected with him have a beneficial entitlement to more than 20 per cent.of the trading income, for example through a carried interest in the capital of a managed fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals in the Bill were developed in consultation with representatives of the fund management
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
industry, but concerns have emerged from within the industry that the 20 per cent. rule would work differently for different types of investment funds depending on their legal form. The amendments, which have been developed in consultation with, and agreed with, representatives of the fund management industry, will remove those differences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments will ensure that where investment management services are provided to a collective investment scheme, as defined in the Financial Services Act 1986, the 20 per cent. rule is applied by looking at the scheme as a whole. Without that amendment, the rule would have to be applied separately to each participant if the scheme were transparent for tax purposes—in other words, the income of the scheme is taxed on the participants in the scheme. The amendments provide that, where the scheme is transparent, the 20 per cent. rule is treated as satisfied by each participant in the scheme: where the scheme, if it were taxed as a separate entity, would not be regarded as carrying on a financial trade in the United Kingdom, whatever the level of beneficial entitlement; and where the scheme, if it were taxed as a separate entity, would be regarded as carrying on a trade, provided that the 20 per cent. rule is satisfied in respect of the beneficial entitlement of the investment manager and connected persons to the taxable income of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments will also ensure that wherever the 20 per cent. rule is not met, it is only the part of the income of the non-resident to which the investment manager and connected persons are beneficially entitled that is excluded from the limitation of charge. The limitation of charge will apply to the part to which they are not beneficially entitled, provided that the other conditions in the investment manager provisions are met. Without that amendment, the whole of the income would have been excluded in certain cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the Government have moved so many amendments, which are exceptionally technical, again demonstrates the complexity of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning we shall discuss several clauses relating to self-assessment. The more that I consider the matter, the more worried I become about the complexity of the subject. The clause is of particular interest because it refers to work that is important in attracting the investment of non-residents to this country, which is done largely by fund managers. They have made representations to the Government that are reflected in the clause. They want to ensure that the United Kingdom remains attractive to such investors, and the Opposition support that aim. However, the complexity of the clauses will add to the costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Tuesday, the Minister said that the subject of the Inland Revenue's use of new technology to deal with self-assessment should be discussed during our debate on a later clause. I shall do so, when I shall raise questions about the cost to—I was about to say the taxpayer, but I should say the Revenue, because the matter relates to the general cost that the Government will have to pay to
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
introduce the measures. It is important that we continue to stress our concerns about the implementation of self-assessment procedures and their implications. Several of the organisations that will have responsibility for advising people on how to deal with the measures have made representations to us and I want to put some of their points to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society expressed its concern that the repeal of several old provisions—for example, the double foreigner exemption in section 82(2) of the Taxes Management Act 1970—could result in a loss of business for the UK, which would have a detrimental effect on the UK economy greater than that resulting from any additional tax recovered. Given that one of the clause's aims is to ensure that business is not lost from the UK, will the Minister respond to that issue raised by the Law Society?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to subsection 1(a), the Institute of Taxation comments that the purpose of the word "regular" in line 17 is unclear. I would never presume to say that I found the clause clear, but when an organisation such as the Institute of Taxation says that it finds a provision unclear, I think that that is worthy of the Minister's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On subsection 2(c), the Law Society comments that the use of the word "customary" in line 45 might exclude the bespoke fee arrangement tailored to the requirements of particular clients, for example, where special fee reductions are dependent on trade in volume. It argues that the word "customary" is a relic from the old days of fixed commission. We do not want to push the matter to the wire, but can the Minister give an explanation that will satisfy those outside the House who are concerned?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society is also worried that the 20 per cent. rule will inhibit the creation of new funds. New funds are often initially dependent on funds supplied by related companies in order to establish a fund's management track record for demonstration to third parties. I do not claim to be an expert on such matters, although I find it fascinating to learn about them. Will the Minister tell us what the Government think about the 20 per cent. rule and how it will affect the creation of new funds?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On subsection (6), 	<i>The Tax Journal</i> of 16 February queried whether the use of the words "profits or gains" in line 6 was deliberate. Under section 833(1) of the Taxes Act 1988, reference to profits or gains shall not include reference to chargeable gains. The writer wondered whether the same words were deliberately used to link the subsection to that section of the Taxes Act. I simply want clarification from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is a grammatical one, but it is perhaps nit picking and I do not want to do that this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the beginning of her comments, the hon. Lady stood back and asked what the main thrust of the clause was. We are trying to ensure that investment managers in the United Kingdom can compete on an equal basis with investment managers in the rest of the world. The clause ensures that a non-resident who decides to use an investment manager in London is not confronted with the possibility of extra tax that he would not face if he used an investment manager elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0815">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>547</span>
The clause also ensures that an investment manager operating in the United Kingdom and dealing with a nonresident is not in turn confronted with extra liabilities in respect of the non-resident.

We consulted all the bodies involved and the changes have been widely welcomed by the industry. They will further improve the attractions of United Kingdom investment managers to overseas investors and their international competitiveness. It is an important invisible export earner. The City accounted for approximately £16 billion of export business in 1993 and we must ensure that the Inland Revenue does not stand in the way of developing that wealth-creation possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No fundamental changes in policy are involved. We have introduced some extra statutory concessions into the law, swept away some antiquated, outdated provisions and introduced some modern ones. No legislative turbulence is being introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, I turn to the points made by the hon. Lady and the use of the word "regular". It is not a new rule. The word was used previously and the same rule is used in the model tax conventions of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the United Kingdom double taxation agreements. I would be surprised if that caused difficulties for those who operate the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady then referred to the Law Society, which is concerned that if the law is not changed in the way that it proposes, there might be some competitive disadvantage. She referred to section 82(2) of the Taxes Management Act 1970 and I shall explain the background. The present rules include various antiquated provisions on the profits which may be brought into charge on the agent. These do not appear in the new rules as they are otiose and irrelevant, because it is the amount of profit that may be charged on the non-resident that matters, not the amount that may be charged on the agent. Even if they were regarded as applying to the liability of the non-resident, they would be of no effect because they are subsumed by the arm's length principle which applies generally to the measure of profits brought into charge on a non-resident. They are therefore no longer needed and should go. That will have no effect on the taxation of nonresidents and should not result in any withdrawal of business from the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady touched on the 20 per cent. rule. When we dealt with the amendments, I explained that we had consulted the industry—I hope that our amendments deal with the anxieties that it raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady's final point concerned profits or gains. This is the usual wording to describe the taxable income and chargeable gains of taxpayers and there should be no distress for those who operate the provisions as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to another section of the Bill in which we revisit the land of exchange gains and losses which detained the Committee for some time in 1993 and for a slightly shorter time in 1994. It was apparent during those discussions that the Government were asking us to endorse legislation that was so complicated that few people, not least members of the Committee, could understand it. By the measures in this clause and the subsequent two or three clauses, we are being asked to attempt, as we do each year, to patch up difficulties that we failed to resolve in previous years. We have the opportunity to examine how the legislation has been introduced and whether or not the tidying-up operations achieve their purpose. If they do not, there may be a further two or three clauses in next year's Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A press release, distributed on 16 December last year by the Inland Revenue, stated that there are a variety of different ways in which those matters are being taxed, and that, to make the system clearer, further regulations would be laid. I do not want to detain the Committee unnecessarily but its attention should be drawn to what exactly is being proposed. To make the legislation work, there are seven different instruments. The press release lists them as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Exchange Gains and Losses (Transitional Provisions) Regulations … The Exchange Gains and Losses (Alternative Method of Calculation) Regulations … The Exchange Gains and Losses (Deferral of Gains and Losses) Regulations … The Exchange Gains and Losses (Excess Gains and Losses) Regulations … The Local Currency Election Regulations … The Exchange Gains and Losses (Insurance Companies) Regulations … The Exchange Gains and Losses (Debts of Varying Amount) Regulations".</p></blockquote>
What sort of legislation are we being invited to pass? I am reminded of what William Simon of the United States Treasury said in 1977 in his blue print for basic tax reform:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The nation should have a tax system which looks like someone designed it on purpose."</p></blockquote>
When we examine the legislation that deals with exchange gains and losses, we have to ask whether it was designed on purpose and, if so for whom? Ostensibly, we are being invited to agree to the legislation because it tidies up—if that claim can be made of it—the exchange gains and losses regime. A more cynical person might think that whoever designed it was clearly planning to head for private practice in the near future, as a tax accountant or lawyer—rich pickings could be made by trying to explain what on earth the measure meant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we go further, the Minister must explain precisely what all those regulations, the amendments, and the measures in clause 117 and schedule 24 are supposed to achieve. I hope that we can deal with clause 117 and schedule 24 together, Mr. Hogg, because they deal with the same issues. If I stray from one to another, I hope that you will not mind too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0816">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>549</span>
My understanding of schedule 24 is that trading gains and losses shall not be taxed under the new provisions if they are already liable to tax as income or capital gains under the Taxes Act 1988. I am not sure whether that idea is new or whether it was always planned. It seems nonsensical to me to spend a great deal of time implementing new legislation if, at the end of it all, we say that if the matter was already dealt with in the 1988 Act, the new legislation will not affect it. My understanding of schedule 24 is that it involves the same rule that applies when a trading gain or loss is liable to tax as income or capital. That rule applies if the company has made sufficient profits or if it paid tax in the relevant accounting period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is reference still being made to the Taxes Act 1988 when we are trying to implement a new regime? If there is a rational explanation no doubt we shall receive one. The Minister can also explain how those seven regulations that deal with exchange gains and losses throw any light on the situation. Our simple objective of trying to bring in line the taxation of such matters and replace existing legislation has resulted in a battery of legislation, which is by no means certain to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that discussions have been taking place between Inland Revenue officials and various interested parties for some time. I understand that, at one of those meetings, such was the frustration of all concerned that someone suggested that the proposal should be torn up and that we should return to the original legislation because the new legislation is so complex. If the new legislation is that complex, there is a substantial risk that either taxpayers will be put to considerable expense in trying to work out what it means, or the Revenue will not get all the money that it should get because it is unclear that the various provisions are satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is highly undesirable that we should be legislating on matters so complex that no one understands them. Never mind that members of the Committee do not understand the legislation, no one who has to work in the field understands it. The Minister of State is nodding—that would be all very well were he a Back Bencher, but he should remember that he is the responsible Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are in such a mess that we no longer know what we are doing and the taxpayers no longer know what we are doing, there is something to be said for calling a halt and instead introducing legislation that is readily understood and that follows Mr. Simon's excellent advice, namely, that the nation should have a tax system that looks as though someone designed it on purpose—and, I might add, for this purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's remarks. Is not there a useful analogy here? We always advise constituents and others that they should not sign any financial services contract that they do not understand, because that would be extremely risky. The same should apply to tax law, if at all possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. As I have told the Committee on several occasions—although it is not a declarable interest—I am a member of the Institute for Fiscal Studies Committee that is examining these matters. We have a meeting tomorrow morning and it is to cover my position on that committee that I am making these remarks.
	<span class='label label-info column'>550</span>
Otherwise, the other members might well ask what I have been doing about the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman). It is bad legislative practice and we keep doing it. The Finance Bills for the past two years have amounted to 800 pages of legislation. Most of it is not politically contentious—in fact, many members of the Committee fervently wish for something politically contentious to liven up our debates—but much is routine, non-political stuff on which the political parties are in agreement. Ironically, it seems that the more consensus and agreement there is, the more complicated the legislation becomes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that, where there is contention and controversy, the result is simple legislation. For example, the poll tax started off as being quite simple—admittedly, it became more complicated when it became abundantly clear that it did not work very well. Where there is a greater degree of consensus, it seems to be less easy to get simple legislation. I am not making this point in order to gain a political advantage—successive Governments have been guilty of this in the past, as will future Governments, no matter how hard they try.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If legislation becomes so complicated that no one understands it, people are entitled to ask whether we should pass the legislation at all. Might not it be better to strike at those things at which we can strike effectively, rather than to have a rule and a regulation for every eventuality? There is a direct analogy with financial services legislation, in which we have a rule and a regulation for every eventuality and, as we saw over the weekend, a fat lot of good that does. It is far better to concentrate on a rule designed to catch whatever mischief we want to stop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise that point on this clause and its associated schedule because we are being invited to patch up difficulties caused by the past two years' legislation. I dare say that there will be a similar clause in 12 months' time. Who knows, Inland Revenue staff may, even now, be drafting the clause for next year's Finance Bill to take account of difficulties that have arisen since this Bill was drafted. I dare say this clause was not rustled up just after the Budget—it has been on the stocks for some considerable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not object to what the Government are trying to do—at least, I do not think so, but then I am not entirely clear on what they are trying to do. I shall be fascinated to hear whether the Minister of State is clear on that point—whether he has mastered his ministerial brief or hopes just to skate through the clause with its aid. It is vital that we understand the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When considering the battery of legislation designed to bring into tax gains that have arisen—especially those arising from outside the United Kingdom either through trade, as in this case, or from income from overseas assets, as we shall come to later—we know that it is a complicated matter. But is there no opportunity for the Government to sit back and ask themselves, "What is the purpose of this legislation and does it actually work?" If it does not work, the Government should go back to the drawing board, as I understand they have been tempted to do in respect of the exchange gains and losses regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee and those outside who read the Committee proceedings will have noticed that I have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0817">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>551</span>
not gone into much detail. That is because I agree with the Government's intentions, insofar as I understand them, in that they are trying to make sense of extremely difficult legislation. However, we are entitled to ask the Minister of State to explain precisely what the legislation is designed to do, why it is so complex, and why on earth the Treasury has had to table seven different statutory instruments in order to try to make the legislation work. Those seven statutory instruments make this a happy day for all lawyers, accountants and tax advisors—they will go out for champagne when they hear that the Committee has passed this measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to ask what the Government's intentions are, because we are in grave danger of creating a dog's breakfast, which will not achieve the object that we thought was reasonably clear when we considered this matter two years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been flipping through schedule 24 while the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not dealing with schedule 24; we shall come to it in a moment. At present, we are dealing with clause 117.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 117 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schedule 24 to this Act … shall have effect."</p></blockquote>
Is not it logical to discuss schedule 24 at the same time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No; they are to be separately debated, in the order in which they appear in the order of consideration.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Is not the order in which we are discussing the Bill perverse?

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No; the order in which clauses and schedules are taken is a matter for the Government.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I intervened earlier, I made a layman's point about simplification and agreed with the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling). Nobody would deny that clause 117 is anything other than clear—it consists of three lines written in fairly plain English. The problem arises with the part that lies underwater. It is like an iceberg; the clause is the top of the iceberg, which is relatively pellucid, but the part under the water—the schedule—is as dense as hell. Can we do nothing to make it clearer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are coming to the submerged part of the iceberg—indeed, we are proceeding straight towards it. I do not know who will be sunk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I seek your guidance on an important point. As you are aware,
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>
the clause operates the schedule. If we defeated the clause—for whatever reason—would we then be unable to discuss the schedule, there being no clause to bring the schedule into play?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it does not mean that. The schedule would be considered and voted on in the same way as the clause. I appreciate that that is a trifle complex and I am probably not bringing any clarity to bear on the matter, but I should be very grateful if we could proceed. I promise the Committee that everything will fall into place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Many hon. Members will want to make points about the schedule when we reach it. I have raised a number of matters of principle. It may be that the Minister has nodded off, but I had the impression that he wanted to reply to those matters of principle, which I believe are in order for a debate on clause 117.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, but it is not a matter for me. If the Minister decides not to respond to the hon. Gentleman, there is nothing that I can do about that. However, the Minister is showing great good will, so I am sure that he will reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Anthony Nelson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy with the points made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central and by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington. In 20 years or more of dealing with Finance Bills from the Back Benches and the Front Benches, I have never come across clauses of such complexity as those in the Finance Acts 1993 and 1994 dealing with foreign exchange gains and losses and the treatment of them on financial instruments such as swaps, currency futures and interest rate futures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will not be of much consolation to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central, who is quite entitled to say that there should be a better way of dealing with such matters. We return to the perennial problem that the outside world requires clarity—as does the Revenue, to prevent avoidance—but in our legalistic system such clarity often demands great complexity and definition in legislation. To respond to outside representations and to retain flexibility, secondary legislation is also needed, whereby the detail of some changes can be brought into effect through regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a way it is proper that I should apologise to the Committee for the complexity of the provisions, but for many years there has been great uncertainty about the tax treatment of foreign exchange gains and losses, especially on monetary assets and liabilities. Many major companies could not afford—and should not be expected—to put up with the uncertainties surrounding the provisions. After a long period of inaction and restraint in bringing forward an undoubtedly complex change in the law it was decided, with the broad agreement of all the relevant representative bodies, that that change should be enacted. It was introduced in the Finance Act 1993 and followed up in 1994.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend remind the Committee of the provisions that existed before 1993?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0818">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>553</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before 1993, the treatment of foreign exchange gains and losses was picked up in the Taxes Act 1988 and the Taxes Management Act 1970. In simple terms, a number of foreign exchange gains and losses fell to be treated as capital gains, others fell to be treated as trading gains or losses and others were not treated as anything. For example, if a company had a loan in a foreign currency, the exchange differences would result in the repayment of that loan giving rise to a profit or loss in sterling, although the loan was in a foreign currency. Such a monetary liability on which there was a change in sterling value on redemption could, if there was a loss arising on it, give rise to an unrelievable sum. That was obviously unacceptable if, as very often happened, the loan was utilised for an asset which gave rise to a taxable profit in sterling. It was important to clarify the issue, which the foreign exchange regime in the Finance Act 1993 did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree, therefore, that many of those problems would be resolved, at least for transactions within Europe, if we had a single European currency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, they would not be resolved, regardless of what one may think of the case for a single currency. There would still be a plethora of other currencies around the world in which companies borrow and account, so the problem would still arise. The problem might be lessened for some companies if there were fewer currencies in the European Union, but it would not be lessened generally because the major currencies of the world, especially the dollar and the yen, would still be the source of company borrowing and asset provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A new regime dealing with the taxation of foreign exchange gains and losses and financial instruments will come into force on 23 March 1995. It will apply to companies from the first day of their first accounting period to begin on or after that date. The bulk of the primary legislation for the FOREX regime is contained in the Finance Act 1993, and that for the financial instruments in the Finance Act 1994. Secondary legislation covering some of the detail of both regimes was laid before Parliament on 16 December 1994. The two regimes are closely intertwined and form an integral package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of the legislation on FOREX is to being the taxation of exchange gains and losses broadly into line with accounting practice. At present some gains and losses arising from currency fluctuations are treated as trading profits or losses, some are treated as capital gains or losses and others fall outside the tax system altogether. Normal accounting practice makes no such distinctions and the result is that there is a mismatch between accountancy treatment of foreign exchange gains and losses and tax treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new rules bring all exchange gains and losses on broadly monetary items into the tax system and provide for such exchange gains and losses to be recognised as they accrue on what is called the translation basis. That means that rather than ignoring or taxing on a realisation basis any exchange differences arising between the acquisition of a monetary asset and its disposal, or the entering into and settlement of a monetary liability, any fluctuations, whether up or down, are recognised for tax
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
purposes each year broadly as reflected in the company's accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most companies produced their accounts already on such an accruals or translation basis. Statement of standard accounting practice 20—issued under the authority of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies—recommends companies at present to recognise exchange differences on monetary assets and liabilities on the translation basis. We are therefore seeking to accommodate within the new regime what most companies already do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new regime has been the subject of extensive consultation with interested parties since 1987 including the issue of three consultative documents on FOREX and three on financial instruments and the publication in draft of the proposed regulations and various tranches of legislation. We have always said that we would proceed with legislative reform on this subject only if the final detailed packages of measures commanded broad support from the business community. I am glad to say that the final consultation, which ended on 18 November 1994, demonstrated that there was broad support, and indeed welcome, for the new regime. On that basis it will, as I said earlier, be introduced with effect from 23 March 1995.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says, quite rightly, that he consulted the business community. Perhaps I was not listening closely enough, but who represented the business community in those consultations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the principal professional bodies—such as the accountancy bodies and the Law Society—were consulted. I have with me copies of the voluminous Acts and consultation documents issued by the Inland Revenue, which were referred to by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central. Detailed responses were considered and were the subject of debate during the Committee stage of the Finance Bills of 1993 and 1994. I remember that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central made the point that it was unsatisfactory to introduce piecemeal changes to legislation as a result of consultation. However, he acknowledged that it was proper to consult on such important matters that impinge on company accounts, profitability and tax liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a considerable response to that consultation, which influenced the redrafting of several clauses and the orders to which I referred earlier. The clauses that we are considering today deal with relatively minor details of the package. Some correct anomalies and difficulties highlighted during the consultation process and some are necessary as a result of other legislative changes since the Finance Act 1993. I emphasise that they are tidying-up measures rather than substantive changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central asked about the first paragraphs of the related schedule. The clause and the related schedule modify part II chapter II of the Finance Act 1993. There are four areas of modification, all minor and unrelated. The clause and schedule also provide for several small amendments to the provisions relating to the interest on overdue tax and tax overpaid in the Taxes Management Act 1970 and Taxes Act 1988, so that they tie in with the pay and file provisions. Those modifications and amendments will come into effect on 23 March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0819">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>555</span>
The first modification—I hope that this answers the hon. Gentleman's question—in paragraph 2 of schedule 24 eliminates areas of overlap between part II chapter II of the Finance Act 1993 and the provisions dealing with charges on income. It ensures that where exchange differences are taken into account as trade charges, they are not also included in the foreign exchange legislation and, therefore, discounted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What exactly is a trade charge in this instance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where interest is payable on a foreign loan, on an accruals basis, the interest must be converted into sterling at the end of the accounting period and may give rise to an accounted sterling interest sum in the accounts. However, it may be that no interest is paid because it is not payable until the next accounting period; but when, in the next accounting period, the interest becomes payable, it may give rise to a lower figure than that which appeared in the accounts due to exchange rate differences between the end of the accounting period and the date when the interest becomes payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is to try to ensure that no more tax is payable than appears to be payable at the end of the earlier accounting period. The opposite would be true if a larger amount was involved. In both cases there would be a trading profit. The point is to pick up that foreign exchange difference between the accounting amount and the actual amount payable arid show that, as a trading liability or leviable cost, it is treated appropriately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my memory serves me correctly—it may be wrong—tax is payable only if there is a gain. There is a translation by reference to sterling in order to compute such gains, but is not it a book transaction rather than an actual conversion? If so, is it possible for there to be a gain when one is only making reference to sterling in order to calculate tax liability?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That contrasts with clause 120, which will allow reference to the local currency. My recollection may be incorrect, but I cannot see how that problem will arise, as the conversion will be made only for the purpose of computing tax rather than realising a gain. If it realised a gain, it would come within the scope of the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both gains and losses are treated under the regime, so the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that both are relevant and would be treated accordingly. Perhaps it would help the Committee if I gave an authoritative example of how the provision will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us say that a company with an accounting date of 31 December accrues interest of $1,000 in its accounts as at 31 December 1996, and that, at that time, $1,000 is worth £450. The interest is deductible as a charge on income and is then paid on 31 March 1997 when $1,000 is worth £500. The interest payable would be £500, not £450, because sterling has weakened against the dollar. In terms of sterling, the interest payable has increased. For tax purposes, relief on the interest is not given until it is paid. Therefore, relief is given on the £500 interest actually paid rather than on the £450 accrued as at 31 December 1996. Therefore, relief is effectively given for
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
the exchange loss and included in the £500. But the accrued interest is also a qualifying liability under the FOREX regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, an exchange loss of £50 accrues on that liability from 31 December 1996 to 31 March 1997. Without this provision in the schedule, that loss would also be relieved. Paragraph 2 ensures that the £50 exchange loss will not also be taken into account for tax purposes. In the example, there is a tax loss, which would be used and relieved for trading purposes. But without this provision it would also be picked up under the FOREX provisions and another relief would apply. Clearly, it would be wrong if the £50 in the example were used as a relief for trading purposes as well as a relief for FOREX purposes. The provision simply prevents double relief in those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister valiantly tried to explain how the provision will operate. Looking around the Committee at blank faces at best, and disinterest at worst, illustrates my earlier point. Have the Government considered changing their whole approach to drafting legislation to make it simpler, to put it in plain English and narrow down the areas covered? That raises a general principle, which may interest those who are following the Committee's proceedings. The Government may not be doing anything at all, but if they are contemplating a change in their approach to drafting legislation, we should like to know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, who has overall responsibility for the drafting of the Finance Bill, is concerned about that. Some of the changes that we have been considering include the possibility of obtaining outside assistance in drafting certain tax provisions. That is an attempt to get better value for money, but it would also enable us to take advantage of resources outside the scope of parliamentary draftsmen, able and respected though they are, in dealing with the logistics of the hasty preparation of legislation. In addition, we believe that it might give us the opportunity to seek other advice on whether some clarity and simplification can also be provided. I have no great hopes about that. Until there is a fundamental change in what is required in law, it will be difficult for an external draftsman to come up with a different response to the remit that he is given on a policy basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee or the House at another time might want to consider the non-partisan problems of how to create laws that not only responsibly protect the Revenue but provide the certainty and clarity required by companies. That is extremely difficult to achieve. If there is doubt in the law arising from a broad-brush simplistic approach which allows the drafting of tax legislation to provide for a high degree of discretion in its interpretation, it will be difficult to protect the Revenue and provide the clarity and certainty that outside bodies, such as the Law Society, have told us that they need. There is a dilemma to which I do not know the answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The steps that the Minister referred to are the steps referred to by the Chancellor two or three weeks ago when he suggested that he was going to privatise the drafting of legislation by bringing in outside lawyers. With respect, that does not address what we are discussing this morning. We are trying to make the Bill simpler.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0820">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>557</span>
Outside lawyers, who one day might be drafting legislation and the next day making a fortune out of interpreting it, would not be the best people to simplify matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, who is I believe a lawyer, denigrates his profession by suggesting that an outside lawyer working on a piece rate might propose unduly complex legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary and I are concerned about tile need to clarify. When we debated earlier clauses, it was established that a tax review body is considering the clarity of legislation—the plain English necessity of trying to ensure that legislation means what it says and is understandable. I would welcome an approach that would cut through the gobbledegook.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to stray too far, but there is another problem. Several hon. Members have said that when they look at clauses, in the Bill or other legislation, they are immediately faced with a reference to an Act which, when looked up, refers to another Act. It is almost impenetrable and impossible to get to the bottom of the matter, even with the able assistance of professional advisers and others. That problem can be resolved on consolidation measures, although the House does not like voluminous legislation, be it novel or consolidating. But there is a case for further consolidation of what we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I have yet to be persuaded that the case has been made for the separation of different taxes and management Acts from Acts dealing with financial measures. We would still have a residual piece of highly detailed legislation which has to be passed, which will be contentious in parts and for which Ministers will be rightly answerable in the way that I am today. The separation of simple aspects of legislation from complex aspects of legislation will not necessarily make legislation more understandable or easier to pass through the House. There are issues of accountability that Ministers, who are also Members of Parliament, have to recognise. The Government will do their best, as all Governments should, to try to ensure that the law and the provisions of Bills are more understandable. I regret that the high importance of the provisions that we are dealing with today has meant that another approach has not been adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the clause, which builds on and tidies up some of the 1993 and 1994 changes, will be accepted. I assure the Committee that I have done my best to get into the detail of the clauses and schedule. They are necessary. I think that I understand them fully and will be happy to answer further questions on clause 117 or the related schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to commend my hon. Friend the Minister of State for the way in which he has explained what are, by any standard, complicated provisions. The Inland Revenue has worked hard to get them right. The debate began in 1987, as my hon. Friend said, and this is the third bite at the cherry. The provisions will take effect from 20 March, last year, which may sound retrospective but is not because accounts have not yet been published for that period. It is a great step forward to have tax provisions that are closer to provisions in accounts. An exchange gain or loss is either a revenue gain or loss or a capital gain or loss. It makes a great deal of sense to deal with it on that basis. My hon. Friend is right about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>558</span>
The question is not whether the Committee can understand every clause and schedule. It is not realistic to expect every taxpayer to understand every provision. The more important question is whether the expert advisers understand. When we discussed clause 75, the Institute of Taxation said that it was unintelligible. I did not like the idea of the Committee agreeing to a clause that the tax experts did not understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By way of contrast, I have noticed that there are few, if any, representations from the Institute of Taxation, the Law Society, chartered accountants on the provisions that we are discussing today. It might be that, because the provisions are so complicated, such organisations have not bothered to examine them. I suspect, however, that the reason is the opposite, and because there has been a great deal of consultation, they are relatively content.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a trade off between simplicity and complexity. Legislation cannot be simple if it involves foreign exchange transactions which are complicated. The legislation has to be equally complicated to meet all the different contingencies. If it does not, it is incomprehensive legislation. Although there is a case for consolidating, as in the Finance Acts 1993 and 1994 and the Bill, the provisions are a good example of the Inland Revenue consulting. Although the legislation is complicated, it is about right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Listening to all the speeches, it would be simpler if I could make my point now. The debate has ranged over the principle behind schedule 24—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I wonder if the hon. Gentleman will just bear with me. I understand his anxiety to make his point on the detail of the schedule. However, to do so now would be out of order. I would rather dispose of the clause and proceed to schedule 24. I promise that the hon. Gentleman will catch my eye immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 117 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it is worth waiting for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To make my point, I shall have to refer to schedule 24, which is four or five pages long. I would appreciate it if my hon. Friend the Minister for State acknowledges what I am about to say when he replies. It is not so much that one tries to avoid length in legislation if length is a contribution to clarity, because brevity, at the cost of failing to achieve clarity is no great advantage. It is better to be long and clear than short and opaque. Speaking as a layman with a vague interest and knowledge in such matters, I want to suggest in all seriousness a methodological change which would alter our approach in the future. Schedule 24 is merely one example of a broader proposition, which was touched on earlier—that is why I was getting so frustrated by earlier speeches. The general proposition is this: why not consolidate—that is the key word—all legislation that is relevant to a particular problem in one Finance Act without forcing tax advisers, taxpayers and companies in the private sector to consult a plethora of complicated and sometimes internally conflicting legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I can argue my point decisively. While I was listening to earlier speeches, I also marked with a blue pencil the various Acts that are mentioned in the schedule. They are the Taxes Act 1988, the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, the Taxes Management Act 1970, the Finance Act 1993 and the Finance Act 1989. There may be other Acts that I missed. When I have had to consult lawyers, I have felt that they earn their money by having all the conceivably relevant books on the shelves behind their desks—or, in modern terms, on computer in an easily-retrievable form. If I had such a library available to me, I could, as a layman, do what the lawyers do, although it would take time and involve opportunity costs. However, laymen should be saved from always having to consult professionals, whether they be lawyers or accountants or anyone else. They should have the methodological possibility of being able to have everything that relates to one dish, or all the ingredients of the recipe, on one piece of paper—or, in this instance, on several pieces of paper. That is self-evidently not a bad suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that my hon. Friend the Minister of State may not be able to comment definitely on that idea now, but he should consult with my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, officials in the Inland Revenue, Treasury counsel and anyone else who could be relevant, to see whether it would be helpful. My hon. Friend the Minister referred several times to his worthy consultations, for which he should be commended. However, who was he consulting? He was consulting professional intermediaries—the sort of people, incidentally, whom I advise in Parliament. To some extent, therefore, I am speaking against my own community. However, I can safely do that because those professionals have been struck by the same phenomenon over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said before, what really matters in an age in which we are moving towards self-assessment, is that the layman or the taxpayer—whether a corporate body or an individual—should be able to go to one place to find all the relevant legislative provisions that bear upon a certain form of taxation or problem of tax avoidance. That is not a frightfully complicated or earth-shattering suggestion, but it involves a methodological change of some importance in the way that the Treasury counsel go about their activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is an opportunity to make some money here. The Treasury of the Inland Revenue could publish annual consolidations. Presently, that is done by a company called Butterworths, which produces a huge yellow handbook that gets bigger each year. I consulted it this morning to look up the law relating to profit-related pay. On such matters, Butterworths is the book to go to. It has made the consolidation already. I do not know how much it costs. Why does not the Revenue publish a similar book, which could make some money for the taxpayer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) has answered, in part but not entirely, the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington, who made an interesting point
	<span class='label label-info column'>560</span>
about the schedule. The schedule deals with seven or eight quite different but related issues about the FOREX regime, which was introduced in the year 1993–94. We consulted about the schedule, and sought to prevent avoidance, which would be of great cost to the Exchequer. It also clarifies the position for companies in a way which was wholly to be expected and which is, quite properly, being introduced. It deals with debentures, qualifying bonds and the calculation of interest that is payable when losses are carried back to previous periods in the FOREX regime—they will be brought into line with the regime that applies for trading gains and losses of that sort. All those detailed changes are necessary, and relate to previous legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington understandably called for what he described as a methodological change. Of course, people annotate and supplement existing laws with codas when they are amended. The Income and Corporation Taxes Acts are reprinted each year to include the latest Finance Act reforms. For instance, Butterworths for the year 1994–95 already incorporates amendments from the Finance Act 1994.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my hon. Friend proposed to go further than that. He seemed to suggest that we should print all the relevant legislation that relates to the schedule. For the purposes of legislation, the schedule would remain in the Bill, but for the purposes of clarity and assistance to Parliament and its Standing Committees, the schedule should also be transplanted. That would involve consolidating a proposed measure with an Act so that the House could consider the result. The implications of that proposal extend far beyond Finance Acts. It extends to local government legislation and to many other pieces of complex legislation. Many people would argue that the same principle should apply to those other areas. Parliament would have to consider the cost and, frankly, whether people would use the facility. Would it be worthwhile printing a whole voluminous Act with a proposed amendment before that amendment had been passed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has not quite grasped what I was getting at. I shall explain it in plain English. All relevant language that bears upon a tax change or the tightening of a loophole should be available, according to the Forman theory, in one document. If I were a taxpayer—whether corporate or individual—and I wanted to find out the tax regime that I had to abide by in connection with FOREX, I should know almost instantly that it could be found in the current Finance Act, unless and until Parliament, in its wisdom, decided to make further changes. All the reforms would be consolidated in one place. One would not need to have sheaves of legislation or documents in one's library.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Acts. Surely it should be possible in 1995 not to have to print out hundreds of pages, but to provide free—I say that because the cost of reproducing diskettes is zero—a diskette that links back to the 1988 Acts or other relevant taxation legislation. It would be up to the layman or company to print out the pages that were wanted. That would not involve a printing problem for Her Majesty's Government. It would place us in parallel with contemporary technology. That could be done with other legislation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that I have been extremely reasonable this morning, as is my wont. That has contributed to making me a most popular Chairman. However, we have spent some time debating a matter that relates neither to the Bill nor to the amendment, although it is an interesting idea. A member of the Committee has now come up with the idea that information could be put on a computer disc and not printed on paper. I should not listen if a member of the Committee were to tell me that it should be in multimedia. We should return to the matter that we were debating: schedule 24.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CONTROLLED FOREIGN COMPANIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to halt your progress, Mr. Hogg, but you will be delighted to know that I propose to discuss specifically the subject of the clause, which deals with controlled foreign companies. We have the familiar problem of schedule 25 being tacked on to it, but I can deal with that with the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the inevitable press release that was issued on 29 September, I understand that the purpose of the clause is to allow controlled foreign companies to continue to use currencies other than sterling for computing their taxable benefits. My question is straightforward—what would happen if the clause were not accepted? Will the Financial Secretary or Minister of State tell the Committee whether we would then have computation of tax liability by reference to sterling, as in the case of foreign exchange gains and losses? Why are we allowing tax on controlled foreign companies to be computed by reference to the local currency? I am a little concerned about that because I understand that companies using the controlled foreign companies loophole have 18 months' leeway in which to delay payment of tax on overseas profits. It occurs to me that by using foreign currency fluctuations they could engineer matters so that they receive a gain that would not otherwise be possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of controlled foreign companies, will the Minister confirm that under present rules the distribution
	<span class='label label-info column'>562</span>
test allows a trading company to distribute 50 per cent. of its accounting profits, whereas a non-trading company must distribute 90 per cent. of its profits? Will the Minister remind the Committee why the figures of 50 and 90 per cent. were selected, rather than 55 or 85 per cent. or whatever, and whether the Government propose to make any changes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about controlled foreign companies and I notice that the Clifford Chance international tax review that was published last year observed that there might be scope for tax avoidance because gains that fall outside the rules covering controlled foreign companies could not be covered. I also understand that the rules apply only to income and not to capital; perhaps the Minister will confirm that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter needs careful examination and we should not allow the provision to be accepted without question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman and will try to deal with his comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure is a relieving one. The clause and the schedule contain an amendment to ensure that when chargeable profits of a company need to be computed for the purposes of the controlled foreign companies legislation, they are expressed in the currency used in the company's accounts. The controlled foreign companies legislation is in chapter IV of part XVII of the Taxes Act 1988. The clause and schedule also contain amendments to that chapter and to the new foreign exchange provisions in chapter II of part II of the Finance Act 1993 connected with the main amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The controlled foreign companies provisions in the Taxes Act 1988 is essentially legislation designed to prevent avoidance of United Kingdom tax through the use of companies controlled in the United Kingdom but resident in countries with a lower level of taxation. United Kingdom companies that control the foreign company can be assessed on an amount equal to the profits of the company, excluding on capital gains. Those profits are calculated on the same basis as if the company were resident in the United Kingdom. However, most foreign subsidiaries of United Kingdom groups are excluded from the legislation primarily because they are genuinely trading locally or are not subject to a significantly lower level of taxation than they would be in the United Kingdom. When foreign companies fall within the legislation, there will be no charge on United Kingdom residents when the foreign company makes what is called acceptable distribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trading companies have always had to distribute 50 per cent. of their available profits—usually the profits shown in their accounts—and, until the Finance Act 1994, non-trading controlled foreign companies had to distribute 90 per cent. of their available profits. The difference is that it is more likely that a non-trading foreign company will be set up in the absence of the requirements as a tax avoidance loophole or mechanism and, therefore, a larger distribution will be required under the rules than would be so for a trading company with the 50 per cent. requirement. However, significant amounts of tax were being avoided by some multinational groups which exploited the mismatch between accounting and chargeable profits. From 30 November 1993, non-trading
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0823">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>563</span>
controlled foreign companies have had to distribute 90 per cent. of their chargeable profits. That was the change which made necessary the amendments to the controlled foreign companies provisions in the Taxes Act 1988 and the related amendments to the FOREX—foreign exchange—legislation enacted in the Finance Act 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As currently enacted, the provisions covering foreign exchange gains and losses in the Finance Act 1993 allow certain companies to calculate their trading profits or losses before capital allowances in a currency other than sterling. For a controlled foreign company—broadly, a company controlled by persons resident in the United Kingdom but itself resident in a country with a lower level of taxation—the new provisions require it to calculate its trading profit in the currency used in the accounts. However, as for other companies, its non-trading profits are to be computed in sterling. That will cause a number of difficulties for the companies concerned. The clause and schedule amend the controlled foreign companies legislation to remove that difficulty. The amended provisions will allow a controlled foreign company to compute its chargeable profits, including both its trading and non-trading results, in the currency of its accounts when the calculation is required for United Kingdom tax purposes. The position for companies that are not controlled foreign companies remains unchanged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here we come to the familiar territory of offshore funds. The Inland Revenue press release of 29 November states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The review was suggested by a number of interested bodies to find ways of simplifying the legislation and easing the compliance burdens for fund managers. The effect will be that special income tax charge imposed by legislation will be no longer operated in a number of cases at the margins where it is reasonable that the provision should apply."</p></blockquote>
Who were those interested bodies? I may have some light to throw on that in a moment. It seems that they came to the view that we do not need to apply legislation—and, therefore, tax—to a number of cases at the margins. What are the margins? One person's margin might be reasonable and another person's margin might not. We are entitled to ask the Government what they had in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might have accepted that the intention was simply to ease the burden on hard-pressed taxpayers, had not my attention been caught by an article in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> on 8 December last year under the heading
	<br><blockquote><p>"Offshore investor protection to be probed".</p></blockquote>
It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Treasury is reviewing investor protection in four dependent territories for the first time since the UK opened the door to certain offshore unit trusts for British investors in 1988.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Bermuda"—</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>564</span>
the usual suspects—are allowed
	<br><blockquote><p>"to market authorised collective investment schemes directly into the UK."</p></blockquote>
We are entitled to ask the Financial Secretary—the Minister of State has left the Room: what review? What is being proposed? We know that there is a lighter touch in regulation offshore and we are entitled to ask why the Treasury is examining that aspect. We presume it wants to make it easier for organisations based offshore to sell into the United Kingdom. Because of what happened last week, I should have thought that even in this Government, alarm bells would have been ringing about whether that regulation is effective enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under other circumstances, I might have moved on to another interesting article in the 	<i>Financial Times.</i> In the article to which I have already referred, however, I noticed a fascinating development that may throw some light on who the interested bodies that have been consulted might be. The article continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Brian Morris, of the securities and investment services group of the Treasury, has begun visiting the islands to discuss necessary changes."</p></blockquote>
That must be a good job to have at the Inland Revenue. Imagine being forced in the course of one's duties to go to Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Bermuda. Curiously
	<br><blockquote><p>"Jersey has not yet been visited"—</p></blockquote>
I assume, therefore, that Bermuda has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When better to visit Bermuda than in autumn and winter? No doubt, Jersey is to be saved for spring. Some time around now the thoughts of the man at the Inland Revenue might start to turn to visiting Jersey. What will he do there? To whom will he speak? What on earth is the Treasury up to? We are entitled to explanations. When we are invited to ease the compliance burden on those with offshore funds, we are entitled to ask why an officer of the Inland Revenue—presumably a senior officer—is travelling around those delightful islands and with whom he is discussing those issues. Those of us who pay tax in this country, especially those on whom the tax burden is increasing, might like a discussion before we start easing the burden on people living in Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Bermuda. Can we have a full account of Mr. Morris's trip?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the article, I learn that the industry—whatever that might be—is
	<br><blockquote><p>"looking forward to the changes"</p></blockquote>
—whatever they may be. We are entitled to know what those changes are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another article from the same day's 	<i>Financial Times</i> was headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"Allure of island funds beyond the mass market".</p></blockquote>
It observes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many aspects of regulation are less onerous offshore than on."</p></blockquote>
No surprise there. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"UK residents—mainly wealthier investors—use offshore funds either to postpone paying tax or because they are planning to live abroad at some point in their lives."</p></blockquote>
An obvious advantage of an offshore fund is that one avoids paying tax. We have to be extremely careful before we ease the wheels and make it easier for people to avoid paying tax. Under a fair tax philosophy, any Government have a duty to ensure that loopholes are closed and not knowingly opened. From the press release issued by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0824">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>565</span>
Inland Revenue on 29 November 1994 it seems that we might be easing the burden on those who struggle by in Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Bermuda. What is the Revenue up to?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My suspicion is aroused even more by that article when I read that when Mr. Peter Gartland, editor of "Offshore Alert" of all things—I wonder who or what he is alerting—was asked about the fact that offshore funds are not heavily promoted to the mass market here, he replied that that was because of
	<br><blockquote><p>"an unwritten understanding that most UK investment would be better kept in onshore funds taxed at source."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>" 'If institutions trumpeted these things too loudly the Inland Revenue and the Treasury would be none too pleased, so they are marketed discreetly.'"</p></blockquote>
That suggests to me that the Inland Revenue and Ministers know full well what is going on. There is some sort of deal, however, that, if no one says too much about it nothing will be done. We are entitled, both in the Committee and the House of Commons, to trumpet such deals extremely loudly. What is going on?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how often Mr. Morris or his equivalent takes a trip around Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and various other delightful spots in the United Kingdom to ask what taxpayers think. It is clear, however, that the 	<i>Financial Times</i> is on to something. It knows that the Treasury is reviewing investor protection and, presumably, the entire taxation regime. The measures in clause 121 seem to ease the burden on such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dare say that the Financial Secretary will tell us not to worry too much about that matter. We are entitled to worry, however, because—as I understand it—two changes are proposed. One change
	<br><blockquote><p>"would exclude entities that are not recognised as collective investment schemes under Financial Services Act 1986 and the offshore fund provisions."</p></blockquote>
The other would exclude
	<br><blockquote><p>"certain types of commercial structures used by international groups that are not created as vehicles for rolling up income but may technically be offshore funds as legislation currently provides."</p></blockquote>s
What are those structures? We have been right to be deeply suspicious about this aspect in relation to the Government. A large number of those who back them in mysterious ways might benefit from such a device. We do not altogether believe that the Government examine such matters with the impartiality and detachment that one might hope for. When we read informed articles—the 	<i>Financial Times</i> is no speculative newspaper, but has some authority—we are entitled to ask what is going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fascinating to note that, in October last year, the 	<i>Financial Times</i>—before that paper could have known about the clause—published a guide to all such overseas investment trusts. A market clearly exists. We should be extremely wary about encouraging some of our citizens to arrange their affairs so that they can dodge paying tax while the rest of us have no such option. We have already expressed concern about self-assessment and other changes. It is not the Government's job to ease the wheels of the tax avoidance industry, no matter how tempted some Conservative Members might be to do so or where their sympathies may lie. If the Government are talking about reducing investor protection, they are at last getting involved in that aspect. We already have enough trouble
	<span class='label label-info column'>566</span>
with reducing investor protection in the home market, without actively encouraging more problems in future. We have every right to be concerned about the clause and I hope that the Financial Secretary will give us a satisfactory explanation about its functions and explain what the Inland Revenue is up to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Given that Opposition Members are often pledging their support for civil service unions, I am sure that the Inland Revenue Staff Federation will be fascinated to hear that there has been an unwarranted, snide and carping attack on an individual civil servant. It is the politics of envy personified. If the hon. Gentleman has any pretensions about being a serious commentator on financial matters, he can do better than provide a snide commentary on 	<i>Financial Times</i> articles. It is disgraceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's press releases seem to suggest that the provisions in the clause would make the tax regime simpler and easier for offshore accounts used by wealthy tax dodgers to avoid the sort of taxes that others pay. I appreciate that if we do not provide such facilities, other countries such as Luxembourg might. There is also a case for arguing that at least we provide such facilities under a reasonable regime of control and regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary must explain the Inland Revenue press release of 29 November, which suggested that the basis of the measure was to simplify the regime for those who want to avoid tax and to make it easier for them to do so. That release revealed that the measure was about easing compliance burdens for fund managers and that the effect would be that special income tax changes imposed by legislation would no longer operate in some cases. The press release later stated that the objective was to exclude certain types of commercial structures used by international groups, which were currently treated as offshore funds and therefore covered by the tax rules. Presumably, they will not be so treated in future. That should be explained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Financial Secretary will also tell us whether taxes on offshore funds increased when taxes on ordinary families increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far be it from me to be overly worried about protecting those who use offshore funds, but I believe that in 1988 we authorised Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Bermuda to market the funds in the United Kingdom on the basis that they were able to satisfy us that they complied with the regulations in the Financial Services Act 1986. As a result, some offshore jurisdictions implemented rules akin to those of the Securities and Investment Board relating to the management of such funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0825">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>567</span>
That situation has now changed. I understand that Mr. Brian Morris is visiting the various islands partly to talk about the tax regime but partly also to say that various offshore funds may not comply with the regimes now in force in the United Kingdom. The funds comply with regulations in force four or five years ago but the islands have not subsequently updated and amended their regulations and therefore the level of security for investors is perhaps not as great as it would be in the United Kingdom. Should we be making it simpler and easier for persons in this country to use those offshore funds while admitting that the standards that we impose in this country are not the standards now in force in Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man and Bermuda? The grounds on which the original concessions were given were that the funds should comply with standards applied in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That issue must be dealt with, especially in the light of events at Barings. Perhaps the two cases are not directly comparable, but we know that we must re-examine the whole basis of regulation and supervision in this country. It is therefore important, when we are making these tax changes, that the Financial Secretary assures us that the rules will be satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary must explain exactly what Mr. Brian Morris was doing during his trip. Was he simply talking about the rules and regulations covering offshore funds? Or was he saying, "Look, old boy, we're considering various tax changes—what sort of taxes would you accept? What can we get away with imposing?" What was Mr. Morris doing and what is the Treasury up to in terms of dealing with offshore accounts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that there has been enormous growth in offshore accounts, with many banks and fund management schemes being set up in the locations that I have described. It may be that they would have been set up elsewhere—in locations outside our control—if we had not created these regimes, but can the Financial Secretary tell us whether he and the Government are satisfied with the growth of the regimes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has been the effect on domestic investment, especially in manufacturing and industry? Do the Government believe that offshore funds will in the long term benefit this country in terms of investment? As my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central has pointed out, Roger Taylor, writing in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> of 8 December, said that offshore funds were being used mainly by wealthy investors who were trying to postpone paying tax or who were planning to live abroad at some point in their lives—not because they intended any long-term benefit for Britain. The Financial Secretary should tell us whether the Government are happy and satisfied with their encouragement of the growth of offshore interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have raised several issues. I hope to allay their suspicions and concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause makes two minor but worthwhile changes to the offshore funds legislation. It stems from a review, and the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central asked who took part in that review. I am happy to tell him that some very reputable bodies participated. The joint exercise took place between the Revenue and a group of representative
	<span class='label label-info column'>568</span>
bodies comprising the Law Society, the Institute of Taxation and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales—fine, upstanding bodies of people. The conclusions on which the clause is based were unanimously agreed by the group. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that there was nothing sinister in the motives for setting up the review—it was set up with reputable organisations and for the best purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central asked for an explanation of the clause's purpose. I am happy to provide that. The offshore funds legislation was introduced in 1984. Broadly, it is concerned with offshore roll-up funds, which accumulate income until investors realise their holdings. Gains arising on disposal are treated as income for tax purposes. Funds that distribute most of their income each year and meet various conditions can apply to the Inland Revenue to be certified as distributor funds. Gains made on disposal of the holding in a qualifying fund are subject to capital gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not change the general thrust of the legislation, but makes two relaxations at the margins where the Government have accepted that the current rules are unduly onerous. I shall deal with the second of the two changes first, because that is in no way controversial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present a fund seeking distributor status must broadly distribute most of its income each year, unless there is no income at all. That rule can be unreasonable where the gross income of a fund is very low and the administrative costs of distributing it to investors are disproportionate. The clause simply introduces a de minimis limit so that funds will be excused from making a distribution of the income available for distribution is no more than 1 per cent. of the average value of the fund's assets for the year in question. There is no difficulty with that change being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other change is to the definition of a material interest in an offshore fund, so that the legislation will no longer apply to entities that are not defined as being collective investment schemes for the purposes of the Financial Services Act. At the margins, various commercial structures exist that are not intended as vehicles for rolling up income, but might appear to be encompassed by the very wide definition of offshore fund in the existing legislation. In practice those entities may already qualify for one of the exclusions that the legislation provides, but that can only be determined by specialist tax advisers, who must first apply a fairly complex series of tests to the proposed arrangements—a process that ultimately adds to the administrative costs of the proposed scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By removing non-collective investment schemes altogether, it can be established at the outset by a simple test that such an entity is not an offshore fund. The clause will therefore save an unnecessary compliance burden in those cases. There is, of course, no change in the position of the mainstream offshore funds—and they are the great majority—which are collective investment schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause also makes a consequential change to legislation concerning insurance companies, where the concept of "relevant interests in offshore funds" appears. These are anti-avoidance provisions, which have not been raised in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0826">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>569</span>
I must make it clear that the Government will be carefully monitoring the effects of the change in the definition of an offshore fund. It is intended as a relaxation to help promoters of bona fide arrangements reduce their compliance costs, and our estimate is that the scope for abuse, if any at all, is very slight. The clause already includes provisions to safeguard the anti-avoidance legislation applying to insurance companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, however, evidence emerged that tax planners were attempting to abuse the relaxation by creating vehicles that did not fall within the Financial Services Act 1986 definition of collective investment schemes, but that could in some way be used to roll up income, the Government would not hesitate to withdraw it. That warning should be put on the record at the outset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central asked what sort of schemes might be exempted by the redefinition. An example would be a financing arrangement within a multinational group that was never intended as a means of rolling up income to produce a capital sum something that offshore funds legislation is designed to tackle. Introducing the collective investment scheme test should ensure that practitioners can decide quickly and easily that such arrangements would not be subject to offshore funds legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Warwickshire, North (Mr. O'Brien) asked why we were making matters simpler and easier for the investor. The changes in the clause do not feed through to the investor: they affect the people managing the funds, so the investor will not notice much difference. The hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out that offshore funds do not have SIB protection and most investors would prefer to invest onshore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about Mr. Morris—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary is passing over the point very quickly. The concessions to market those funds in the UK was given on the basis that the same sort of protection that applies in the UK would apply in those four centres. For that reason, rules akin to those in the Financial Services Act 1986 were passed and rules akin to the SIB regulations were applied in those areas in 1988–89. As I understand it, the rules have not been updated to bring them into line with the present situation in the UK. If there is to be proper protection, that should be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That brings me neatly to Mr. Morris, who works for the Treasury, not for the Inland Revenue. He is reviewing the designated territories—Bermuda, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man—from which companies are allowed to sell into the UK. The review will ensure that they comply with UK financial services legislation, in particular with investor protection. I hope that the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North agrees that the review is entirely worth while. Any suggestion that Mr. Morris's visits deliberately coincide with holidays or the summer are wholly unworthy and should be instantly withdrawn. The review is being carried out to help investor protection in the UK, which is an important exercise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the rules come into effect on 23 March. Can the Minister assure us that protection will be in place by then? Surely he cannot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>570</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause makes two relatively minor changes to the legislation, which I have explained. The review on which Mr. Morris is engaged is a separate matter, not specifically focused on the two specific provisions before us. There is no reason why the commencement dates of the review or any conclusions that emerge from it should coincide with the proposals before the Committee this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is Mr. Morris not going to Gibraltar?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Financial Secretary has just explained that Mr. Morris's itinerary is not altogether covered by the clause, which does not really deal with the same issues. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central brought the matter up and the Financial Secretary answered him, but where else Mr. Morris should go is not a matter for the Committee and I hope that the Financial Secretary will not respond to that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall never know where Mr. Morris is going. The hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Hawkins) has once again made a point and then vanished, but to respond to his point, Mr. Morris is a civil servant and is therefore entitled to a degree of protection to which Ministers are not entitled. Having broken surface and given an interview to the 	<i>Financial Times,</i> however, he will probably not mind if hon. Members comment on him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Mr. Morris did not break surface because of clause 121. I have allowed the hon. Gentleman to make his points about Mr. Morris and the Minister has been kind enough to explain why Mr. Morris was in Jersey, the Isle of Man and Bermuda—which is an excellent place to visit on a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association trip—but we must stop talking about his itinerary. I have said that it is not really in order, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not go down that road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I have two points to raise. First, it has been suggested by a member of the Committee that I was gratuitously rude to Mr. Morris and I should like to refute that. Secondly, the Financial Secretary has offered explanations on the general points that I made—and in particular he asserted that Mr. Morris had nothing to do with the clause. Your ruling seems to be based on the assumption that he is right about that and that there should therefore be no further debate on the matter. With respect, that is a novel proposition. Ministers frequently make assertions about clauses which they would like us to believe but which may be open to challenge. I do not want to prolong the debate, but I seek your guidance because I challenge some of what the Financial Secretary has said. I am happy to leave Mr. Morris wherever he is and never mention the man again, but I want to challenge some of what the Financial Secretary has said about Mr. Morris's visit because I am not convinced by it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the first point, I am concerned only with whether remarks made by hon. Members are in order, not with whether those remarks have any validity.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0827">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>571</span>
The hon. Gentleman is an experienced Member of Parliament and he knows how to answer such points as they arise, if they are worth answering at all. He must exercise his judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was always unhappy with the Mr. Morris debate. Mr. Morris has been elevated to a status about which he will certainly tell his children this weekend, but I hope that we can now move away quickly from him and leave it at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I was in the middle of a speech, which I should like to continue, Mr. Hogg. I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his general explanation, though I think that it was appropriate to flag up a general concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central issue is that, at a time when everybody else is being faced with a greater tax burden than ever before, it is not right that the Government should be easing the burden on people who cannot possibly be said to be among those in the greatest need. I am not convinced by what the Financial Secretary has said and, for the reasons set out by my hon. Friend the Member for Warwickshire, North and myself, I do not think that we should let the clause go through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary said that he knew already that there might be abuse of one of the concessions being made. He felt it necessary to make a ministerial statement in Committee, saying that if there was abuse, the concession would be withdrawn. Considering that warning and everything else that has been said, it is quite wrong to let the clause go through without opposition and we shall seek to vote on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>572</span>
from the accountancy profession that there is a loophole, which the Government are seeking to close with their decision to try to stop the open sale of management expenses companies. However, professionals outside the Committee feel that there may be an element of overkill in what the Government are doing that will possibly catch the innocent as well as the knowledgeable. I suggest to my right hon. Friend that either a motive test needs to be built in or the rules need to be relaxed to allow surplus management expenses accruing before the change of ownership to be offset against, for example, the gains accruing but not realised before the change. That is a simple point. I hope that I have expressed it clearly. It would help the profession, and others, to hear what my right hon. Friend has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(9A) Subsection 9 above shall not apply to the extent that the total profits include a chargeable gain arising from the disposal of the asset which immediately prior to the change of ownership was owned by the company or by a company which was at that time its 75 per cent. subsidiary and had not subsequently been disposed of (disregarding any no gain/nor loss transfers occurring after the change of ownership).".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington has, to some extent, explained the reason for the amendment. We both understand that the clause and the schedule are intended to stop the sale of shell companies that have surplus management expenses in them. That seems an entirely legitimate objective, but the schedule goes considerably wider than that. One transaction that it appears to catch is when a company is sold that later realises a gain or an asset which it held prior to being sold. The schedule stops the company's management expanses being offset against its gain even though everything arose before the sale when an offset would have been possible. The amendment would deal with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, with parallel eloquence, has made the case for relaxing part of schedule

	<span class='label label-info column'>573</span>
26. As he rightly said, it is an anti-avoidance provision. There was no quarrel with the thrust of the clause and the schedule. I understand his arguments, but I cannot recommend the amendment to the Committee. It would be contrary to the guiding principle of the clause because it would allow relief for excess management expenses and charges from before a change of ownership of an investment company against a chargeable gain arising on the subsequent disposal of an asset, albeit one owned by the company or its fellow group company before the change of ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of this part of the legislation is to identify those cases in which it is inappropriate to allow the use of management expenses and charges incurred during the previous ownership of the company. That is why it takes effect only when there is a change in the ownership of a company and a change in the nature or conduct of its business. The rules governing the set off of advance corporation tax take effect in the same circumstances and provide the same treatment envisaged in the new provisions It has not proved necessary to amend the advanced corporation tax rules to cater for those circumstances, and I am not persuaded that it is necessary to amend the new rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would undermine the effect of the new provision by providing special treatment for gains on certain assets arising after the change of ownership. The consequence of accepting the amendment would be that excess management expenses and charges could be set, not only against the part of the gain which had arisen before the change in ownership—for which the Committee may feel, as I do, some sympathy—but also against the part which had arisen after the change. Furthermore, there is no mechanism preventing relief being given for gains inflated by the enhancement of an asset before its disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the amendment does not make those distinctions because the requisite legislation would be extremely complex to draft and difficult to reconcile with the general approach taken by the clause. But without them, it is not possible to distinguish between the part of the gain arising before the change and the other forms of gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have sympathy with my hon. Friend's point, the amendment goes too far and would open up considerable possibilities for continued tax avoidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with the Government's proposed changes to profit-related pay. I should like to ask the Financial Secretary about the way in which the scheme operates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme was introduced by the then Chancellor, Lord Lawson, in the 1986 Budget. The scheme was widened by someone who I am sure the Government do not want to be referred to this morning: the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Thames (Mr. Lamont). I am sorry to bring grief to the Government so soon. I wonder what the right hon. Member would say were he in Committee this morning. However, I suppose that that is idle speculation. The right hon. Member introduced new elements to profit-related pay in 1991. The clause will change the scheme yet again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rationale for introducing the scheme in 1986 was that labour costs per unit of output continued to rise faster than that of our principal competitors overseas. The scheme was intended to introduce an element of flexibility into the pay system in order to deal with the effects of the recession. The scheme seems to have turned out to be expensive. What has the scheme cost the Exchequer this year? I have heard estimates that it is in the region of half a billion pounds, which is a lot of money. If that amount is involved, the Government should explain their view of the scheme's future. Do the original intentions of the scheme still apply? Does a

	<span class='label label-info column'>575</span>
primary objective of the scheme remain the maximisation of wage flexibility not for its own sake but in order to reduce the scale of redundancies during a recessionary period?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister seriously telling us that that element of wage flexibility has reduced the number of redundancies? I have difficulty believing that, in the norm-east—an area which I represent and know well—it has done anything to alleviate the number of redundancies. There have been an enormous number of redundancies in basic industries in that area. Indeed, the number of redundancies throughout the country is immense. Despite the fall in unemployment, there has been no rise in the number of people employed. The provision was supposed to have some effect on that difficult area, but many of us believe that it has not had the intended effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell the Committee how effective he thinks it has been, given the original intentions of the scheme? If the scheme has not had its intended effect, how has that means of tax relief been effective in the labour market? Will the Minister say which firms have been able to use the scheme and whether it has led to an expansion of their trade? Has it led to any increase in employment or prevented people from losing their jobs? Such issues are not dealt with in the clause, but are raised by the main aim of the scheme. Will the Minister tell us the cost of the scheme, whether he thinks that it has been effective, whether it has prevented redundancies and, if it has, in which industries, if he will not name firms? Many of us are unconvinced that the scheme has been effective in reducing redundancies. If the Government agree, have they any other ideas how to prevent redundancies and create jobs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the day of the Budget, we were told in a press release that the number of people benefiting from the scheme had increased significantly, such that, by the end of September 1994, 1,875,700 employees would benefit from the relief. I have no doubt that that is why the estimate that I have been given is so large. But it is also true that the real uptake of the scheme has happened since the changes were introduced in 1991. It is unclear from the information that the Government have given us to date who is taking up the relief and the majority of the money. Where in the economy has the scheme taken off? Have
	<span class='label label-info column'>576</span>
the Government sought to extend knowledge about the scheme among firms?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to say that it is unimportant to encourage employees to find ways of cutting costs in their firm. If they do so, that should be recognised through the scheme. If employees contribute to the profits of a firm, that should enable them to qualify for tax relief. That principle has some merit. In which areas of the economy has that occurred? Opposition Members want a regional understanding of where the tax reliefs go. They should go to those areas that are most vulnerable to redundancies. Some areas are particularly prone to excessive redundancies, such as the north, because of the nature of the industries that operate there. Tax relief should go, for example, to the shipyards of the north-east, where it would help to retain jobs. It would be wrong if that support were stopped, and the Government continued to support other industries elsewhere. What is the value of the Government's support to industry, and to which regions does it go? If we want a dynamic economy, we must ensure that that dynamism is encouraged in those areas of the country that are not overheating, and which are not experiencing the problems that have occurred in areas such as the south-east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If most of the tax relief were going to the south-east, that would cause problems for the Government's industrial strategy. Government support to industry should benefit the right areas of the country. What effect has the scheme had on the morale and commitment of the work force? Once a work force has received the tax benefit, is it more motivated the next year to find new ways of making savings and of increasing profits? Is tax relief a vital way to ensure that employees work out how they can most effectively contribute to a company?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other factors are relevant, including giving employees a say in the decisions of a company. However, the Government have turned their face against that form of employee motivation. Employees will not be involved in the running of a company. If we are to support any extension of the scheme—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
