	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sir George Young)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. In our debate on clause 125 this morning, I said that instead of 80 per cent. of sub-contractors qualifying for a certificate, the figure would fall to 50 per cent.—I should have said 20 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that those who record such figures will have noted that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Mr. Hogg. The hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Banks) today asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer in a parliamentary question whether
	<br><blockquote><p>"he intends to proceed with his proposal to make it obligatory for part-time directors as well as part-time employees to be included in tax-relieved employee financial participation schemes, including approved executive share option schemes."</p></blockquote>
The right, hon. and learned Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No. After further consideration, and in the light of representations from institutional investors, my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury … proposes to introduce amendments on Report stage of the Finance Bill to ensure that the new provisions about the inclusion of part-time workers in tax-relieved employee financial participation schemes will apply only to part-time employees and not to part-time directors."</p></blockquote>
It is typical of the Government that they cave in to Labour party pressure on that issue, but will hot tell the Committee what they intend to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that that is not a point of order for me, but the Financial Secretary may wish to make some observation. I will allow that because I am generous and reasonable. However, it is not a point of order, so if the Financial Secretary does not wish to respond, we must proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. How can the Committee sensibly debate new clause 5 without knowing what changes the Government intend to make to it later?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may, indeed, present problems for the Committee, but it does not present problems for me. I am concerned only with what is procedurally correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. When we reach Government new clause 5 we may have a full and well-informed debate about the new clause and the amendments. The Government put into the public domain, and told Parliament as soon as they could by way of parliamentary question, their proposed intentions to modify new clause 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is as much as I can allow. We must proceed to clause 135.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Matthew Carrington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fulham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it a point of order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, Mr. Hogg. I want to participate in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite amazing what our standing orders provide for—even speeches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. I shall be brief in speaking to clause 135, but before doing so, I shall declare an interest. I am the unpaid parliamentary adviser to the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds. I am also adviser to a bank—the Saudi International Bank—which does not have any unit trusts under its management, but does take on fund management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 135 is very welcome. It brings the regulations for open-ended investment into line with the regime for unit trusts. The industry has been pressing for such a measure for some time and would like the regulations to be implemented as rapidly as possible. The clause is necessary because international competition in such trusts is becoming increasingly great. The fact that open-ended investment trusts are not treated in the same way as unit trusts has led to the shift of some business out of London to more tax-friendly regimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, one slight problem with the clause. I do not expect it to be dealt with this afternoon, but I believe that more discussion is needed between the industry and the Treasury on how it could be tackled in future. The problem is raised by clause 135(3)(b)—a somewhat technical paragraph which transposes the treatment of foreign income dividends currently applied on unit trusts into open-ended investment trusts. It has arisen not so much from the treatment of the open-ended trusts but from the treatment of unit trusts because of the way in which the foreign income dividend regime recognises the recovery of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is straightforward. Some owners of unit trusts are taxpayers and some are not—for example, foreign nationals who do not pay tax in this country. Trusts need to distribute the totality of their income, which means that they must distribute to a point at which their ability to recover advance corporation tax becomes questionable. The difficulty is that their treatment of unit holders has to be equal between those who pay tax and those who do not. Although there has been discussion with the Revenue, the industry has received legal advice which suggests that it cannot treat the average unit holder as being typical, but has to consider each unit holder in his own right. It cannot therefore discriminate against one unit holder as opposed to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a unit trust distributes income in a way which does not prejudice non-taxpayers, taxpayers are automatically likely to be prejudiced. Consequently, it will be impossible to reconcile the tax treatment of unit trusts with the same treatment for open-ended trusts. The industry does not altogether see its way through the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0861">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>627</span>
problem and it may well be that the only answer is to create two distinct types of unit trust—those for non-tax-paying investors and those for tax-paying investors. That, however, has administrative and marketing implications and would create severe problems for the industry, perhaps causing some business to leave London and go offshore, which the clause is specifically designed to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like my hon. Friend the Minister to show his willingness this afternoon to discuss the problem with the industry and seek a solution to it. If that solution requires a statutory change it could be introduced in next year's Finance Bill, but I hope that it could be done purely by regulations addressing the conundrum of taxpayers and non-taxpayers in unit trusts and open-ended investment trusts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have several points to raise, but I should like to start with one of the points made by the hon. Member for Fulham (Mr. Carrington).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pity that the proceedings of the Committee are not being televised. If they were the hon. Gentleman could have seen on a video copy the ashen faces of some Conservative Members when he revealed that he had an unpaid consultancy. Clearly there was a feeling that he was letting the side down badly, although he was, in fact, practising what Conservative Members preach by seeking to undercut the very high consultancy fees that are charged by many of his hon. Friends. I commend him on his public spiritedness, because he does a fair amount of work for the association and he does not charge any fees for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members frequently do things because of the importance of the actions that they are being requested to undertake and because of their role. The position that I declared was inherited from the hon. Member for Slough (Mr. Watts), who performed the function for many years. I believe that he, too, declared it as an unpaid interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not seeking to criticise the hon. Gentleman for one moment. He quite properly declared the interest. I well remember the hon. Member for Slough, whose declarations were a Welcome feature of the first few sittings of the Finance Committee. The hon. Member for Slough often tabled new clauses and amendments and always properly declared his interests. I do not think that we want a debate on the subject of declaring interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My past experience of the hon. Gentleman tells me that nothing that he could say would be an especially constructive contribution to the debate. If he can contain himself, I may allow him to intervene later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was going to say that I am grateful to the hon. Member for Fulham. I received a brief from the association at lunchtime, which I have not yet had a chance to understand fully—I am therefore grateful to the hon. Gentleman for telling the Committee what the association said. When the Minister replies to the debate,
	<span class='label label-info column'>628</span>
I am sure that he will respond to the point on the foreign income dividend regime. To those who follow our proceedings, I say that if they want to send briefs and raise issues, to do so at lunchtime constitutes fairly short notice. We might have dealt with this part of the Bill already, if we had made faster progress earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the sake of completeness, as I was slightly rude to Conservative Members, I should declare an interest. I have had lunch at the association's offices on two occasions. I am therefore aware not only of the work of the hon. Member for Fulham, but of the association's various concerns. Lunch is not a declarable interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I shall do so later on, as I said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make a general point about this part of the Bill. The open-ended investment company is an innovation, and we should examine some of its implications, rather than pass it straight into law. We seek clarification from the Government on two important points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in favour of giving savers a wider choice. Such a savings vehicle is widely available in the rest of the European Community, and there is no reason in principle why it should not be available in this country, subject to the safeguards to which I shall return. However, we are concerned about the regulatory aspects, which were canvassed in the consultative document that the Treasury published in December 1993. The document was a report by the securities and investment services group of the Treasury entitled: "Open ended investment companies: a proposed structure".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About a year ago, when I was speaking at a conference, the preceding speaker was the Treasury's expert on open-ended investment companies, and because I arrived early I was treated to an hour's dissertation on those matters. I would not pretend to be an expert, but I think I understand the gist of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This afternoon, I want to explore two particular points with the Minister, which are touched on in section A, paragraph 26 of the Treasury report. It states that unit trusts are a familiar savings vehicle in this country and many people use them. They are extremely useful and I expect that they will continue to grow. However, it would be useful to have the Government's assessment of what impact the open-ended investment companies will have on the unit trust industry because, it is felt in some quarters that unit trusts may become less attractive as a result of the new vehicle becoming available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to note that investors in unit trusts, as the consultative document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"rely partly on the quality of the investment manager and partly on the standards of regulation applied to the business … In addition, unitholders in a unit trust can depend on the fiduciary duties of the trustees to whom they assign their investment assets."</p></blockquote>
That shows that there is an element of protection in respect of unit trusts. It is not immediately obvious that a similar level of protection will be available in respect of the new companies. Obviously, the quality of the investment manager, whether of a unit trust or an open-ended investment company will still be a major consideration, but the element of fiduciary duty will not exist in a company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0862">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>629</span>
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that they are limited liability companies. That has implications, especially if something goes wrong—their liability is, by definition, limited. A trustee, who has fiduciary duties, has a wider liability. I am not saying for one moment that if a trustee did something foolish, investors would necessarily be protected. However, there is some comeback against the trustee which is not necessarily against the directors of a company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a question about the standards of regulation applied to a business. I want to draw the Minister further on that substantial point. As I understand it, two sets of regulations are being drawn up: one by the Treasury and one by the Securities and Investments Board. However, I may have misunderstood the matter, and there may be only one set of regulations. We have not seen any regulations. The Minister said that they would be published at some point this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my search to find out the Government's intentions, I was directed to a speech that the Minister of State gave at the annual dinner of the association of unit trusts and investment funds on 10 November 1994. He said that there were far-reaching changes afoot, one of which was about the open-ended investment company. He gave the usual run round the economy, and I was struck by the fact that he, as the Minister who is responsible for regulation, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have created … an enterprise culture".</p></blockquote>
Indeed, the Government have done so, especially in the light of what has happened over the past two weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, as a result of the changes to the Government's regulatory system over the past two weeks, they will be careful about getting right the regulatory system for open-ended investment companies. Perhaps they should spend some time ensuring that it works, rather than risk making mistakes. I appreciate the point that has been made in connection with unit trusts about getting the legislation on to the statute book quickly, but it is important to have a regulatory system that works. It would be helpful if the Government would tell us what safeguards they have in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should declare, not an interest—because, like my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham, I do not, and have not, since my election to the House, had any paid consultancies—but my background in the area. I used to be the group legal adviser for a company that had two unit trust management companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) is quite right to say that we should not rush into making regulations in this sector or in any other. However, is he able to control the many Opposition Back Benchers who, whenever the matter is debated on the Floor of the House, call for total statutory regulation to be introduced overnight on all financial matters as soon as a Labour Government are elected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That was a lengthy intervention which was not altogether in order. I hope that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central will not take the trouble to respond to an intervention that is not strictly in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must follow what you say, Mr. Hogg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>630</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a novel idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the risk of trying your patience, Mr. Hogg, I should say that the intervention was lengthy, and it was also totally wrong. That is all that needs to be said about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State spent some time discussing open-ended investment companies at the dinner that I mentioned earlier. He said that he would publish regulations that
	<br><blockquote><p>"will be accompanied by a consultation document describing the way our policy has developed in the light of our consultations."</p></blockquote>
I have not seen that consultation document—it may already be available, or it may be in the pipeline. I hope that the Minister will let us know. He also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It will also describe the way that the regulations give effect to the policy. We will invite comment on the regulations and my officials will hold a series of workshops, similar to the ones that proved so successful earlier this year."</p></blockquote>
I am not familiar with the successful workshops earlier this year, so I hope that the Minister will say what exactly he has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make that point because, in paragraph 32 of the Minister's speech, he discusses the board of directors, which, he said, would be both corporate and independent. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our regulations will not require either".</p></blockquote>
I assume that he means that the companies will be left to decide for themselves whether they should consist only of corporate directors, only of independent directors, or of a blend of the two. At least, that is what plain reading suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A fundamental point of regulation and supervision is that there has to be blend of practitioner and independent voices on any board as a matter of good corporate governance and good regulatory practice. I am disappointed that the Government are not insisting that those companies should have that blend. The experience in the regulatory field generally—we discussed Lloyd's this morning—shows that boards have to include an outside interest to question the executives in charge to ensure that there is a dispassionate examination of company affairs. The Minister of State has said that the regulations will not require the boards to have independent or corporate directors. What does that mean? He went on to say in his speech to the association that he hoped
	<br><blockquote><p>"in this post-Cadbury world, that you will see as many advantages in independent voices on the board as I do."</p></blockquote>
I agree with that. But if the Minister of State wants independent voices on the supervisory board, why does he not insist on that in the regulations? I am not suggesting that that will eliminate all possibility of things going wrong, but it would help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister has once again, in the Government, met resistance to plans to tamper with self-regulation or to have an outside opinion on such matters. It could be that there is a philosophic reason which is not apparent. But we should be clear from the start that the supervisory boards need to have a proper blend of members so that there is an independent voice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made that point at some length because the Minister of State flagged it up in that speech, which is the only place that he has set out Government policy on the companies. Given the House of Lords ruling in the Pepper
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0863">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>631</span>
case, which entitles people to rely on what Ministers say, it would be helpful if the Minister would give the Committee the Government's official opinion on the boards of directors of open-ended investment companies. I very much hope that he will give a clear signal that the boards should include a strong independent voice to supervise the activities of such companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the points raised in the Treasury consultative document of 1993 and given the terms of paragraph 26 of that document which explain that unit trusts have some protection that will not be obvious in the open-ended investment companies, what will ensure similar safeguards? They cannot be the same and there cannot be fiduciary duty in the sense that a trustee has. What regulations will ensure that the public interest is protected as much as possible? If we are to encourage people to put their money into open-ended investment companies, there must be safeguards and adequate supervision.

The Treasury document says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In addition shareholders will be able to call the board of directors to account for their duties to the company."</p></blockquote>
Over the past few weeks, that sort of assertion has been undermined. Experience has shown that although in theory individual shareholders have an absolute right to call boards of directors to account, in practice they are not always able to do so. They face the corporate equivalent of the block vote. How will individuals call those boards of directors to account? Although we hope that there is no cause for concern, we have to ensure that adequate regulations exist to guard against failure or any problems that may arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SIB is also producing regulations. I notice that paragraph 27 of the Treasury consultative document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Treasury looks to investors to choose which type of scheme best meets their needs. It will be for the market to decide which investment vehicle is appropriate in which circumstances."</p></blockquote>
Selling is something with which the SIB deals and not the Treasury. Where has the SIB got to and what considerations will be canvassed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 135—the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) might have something to say about this—falls into the same category as those clauses that we discussed earlier in which the Treasury tries to have a belt-and-braces clause giving it power to make the equivalent of primary legislation. I understand why many of the provisions must be dealt with in secondary legislation, but the terms are very wide. Before leaving the clause, we are entitled to ask what exactly the Government are proposing, what regulations and further requirements will be imposed and when we can expect to see them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that a Treasury press release states that it is hoped that open-ended investment companies will be available during 1995. If that is so—perhaps the Minister will tell us—it is important to be absolutely clear about the new savings vehicle. We should not simply nod such matters through because they exist elsewhere. People in this country rightly want a high level of investor protection and safeguards. No regulatory mechanism can substitute its judgment for that of individuals, who must make their own decisions, but, with public concern about such matters, it would be helpful if the Minister would make a clear statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support the observations made by my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central rightly identified my hon. Friend the Member for Slough—now the Minister for Railways and Roads—as the author of the matter in our debate last year. It is common to both sides of the Committee that we did not want unit trusts and open-ended investment companies to be disadvantaged by our taxation procedures with the result that they would go overseas to conduct their business. The danger that was presented to us then, and is even more acute now, is that that was happening and continues to happen. The objective of what we decided to enact was that the problem of irrecoverable advance corporation tax that was piling up in such companies would be eliminated by legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly we have not overcome that problem. The advice that we have received from the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds is that that results from the way in which the Revenue interprets the legislation rather than from the detail of the legislation. In so far as it relates to open-ended investment companies, the clause could hardly be more widely drafted, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central said. The powers that are being given to the Treasury under the regulations are almost unprecedented. Clause 135(3)(b) provides the power to modify
	<br><blockquote><p>"the operation of Chapters II, III and VA of Part VI of the Taxes Act 1988".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph (c) provides the power to modify part IV of the Finance Act 1986 and paragraph (d) provides the power to modify sections 75 to 77 of the Finance Act 1986.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to envisage what modification of legislation would be required to allow the Revenue to make a different interpretation of what it is now doing. Some guidance from the Treasury that the way in which it is going about things at present is unnecessarily restrictive may satisfy us, but no doubt we shall hear from my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also rise briefly to support two observations that have been made in the Committee. First, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) that it is inherently undesirable that such very wide powers for making and unmaking primary and secondary legislation should be handed away by the Committee to the Revenue. It is important that we do not make a practice of simply accepting the idea that when a matter is complicated and regulations must be made in markets that are moving, we should give carte blanche or an open cheque to the Executive. That is not good legislative practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central will be surprised to hear that I agree with his comments on the desirability of having non-executive directors on the boards of open-ended investment trusts. That would seem to be extremely good practice in terms of investor protection. The credibility of investor protection in collective investment vehicles is an important marketing tool.

In this case, investor protection is important when a potential saver decides to choose his investment trust or other UCITS vehicle—whether he will buy a French

	<span class='label label-info column'>633</span>
SICAV, a British unit trust or open-ended investment trust or a Dutch open-ended investment trust. Having been a director of a merchant bank with an important asset management activity, I have a little experience of this matter. It is extremely important that fund managers have someone to report to and to be accountable to—someone whom they have to convince about the sound basis of their investment policies. That is readily achieved in institutional fund management. If one is managing a pension fund, one is responsible to its trustees. Every three months or so, one has meetings with the trustees of the pension fund where one has to justify one's performance. Equally, fund managers in a life insurance or a general insurance company will be responsible to the senior management of that company. That management will be extremely conscious of the strengths and weaknesses of performance and the extent to which performance is better or worse than that of rival institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that sort of discipline is extremely difficult to replicate on fund managers in that type of retail fund. Little old ladies do not ring up the fund manager: if they did, they would not be put through. They cannot ask, "Why are you weighted in this sector or market? Why have you chosen those stocks and not others?" Little old ladies need someone to act on their behalf. A trustee is not a suitable person to do that. A trustee may be a suitable person to ensure that the fund is managed in accordance with the prospectus, but that is different from exerting day-to-day and week-by-week control on the fund managers' activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professional fund managers would be the first to concede that when they report directly to someone who is financially sophisticated and understands the markets in which they work, it helps them to do their job properly. Even at this late stage, therefore, I hope that the Government will reconsider. The measure would, on the one hand, improve investor protection and the standing of British registered, open-ended investment trusts vis-a-vis the continental competition—which is part of the object of the operation—and, on the other hand, would not add materially to the cost of the operation—unlike some other proposals brought forward by the Government, such as the proposal to insist that such funds use outside custodians. Non-executive directors would not necessarily be paid an enormous amount in relation to the total return on funds. My suggestion is reasonable and I am slightly surprised that the Government have not accepted it. It is not only the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central who has noticed this and is urging my right hon. and hon. Friends to reconsider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Anthony Nelson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to reply to this brief but informed debate, in particular to some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central. He catalogued several concerns, reasonably expressed, and thereby demonstrated that he has learnt quite a lot about this new and evolving subject which we are all trying to grasp. Obviously, his culinary consultations with the City have paid off and I am delighted about that. Often, as I dash from the Treasury for a sandwich at lunchtime, I see the hon. Gentleman being wafted to the City for further culinary consultations. The Committee is privileged to have the benefit of that wisdom on occasions such as this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>634</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister raises a good point. My one regret when I am taken to those occasions is that it is inevitably in a BMW or a Japanese car, rarely a British car.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think, Mr. Hogg, that you have raised a serious issue. I shall not pursue today the matter of who pays for those lunches or the question of the luxury cars that it is unfortunately not my privilege to be wafted around in. I have to be put up with being driven around in a British ministerial car and I am delighted to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause paves the way for detailed tax rules to be established for open-ended investment companies. Such companies are in economic terms very similar to the familiar authorised unit trusts. But we believe, with the industry, that they will much more readily marketable to European investors who are at home with corporate forms of investment vehicle and are often not familiar with the trust law concepts underlying the unit trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation is a little unusual in that the tax provision for such companies is being introduced before the new corporate code and the detailed product rules regulating their marketing are in place. The Treasury will shortly be publishing the draft regulations providing for the new corporate structure and the Securities and Investments Board's draft product regulations will be published a few weeks later. Both sets of regulations will be subject to amendment in the light of comments received during the consultation period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This approach as far as the tax rules are concerned reflects the constraints of the annual Finance Bill timetable. The structural regulations will be introduced by secondary legislation under the European Communities Act 1972. These regulations in turn will give the Securities and Investments Board the necessary powers to make detailed product regulations. On present plans, we hope to have both of them in force later this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fund management industry will be keen to use the new vehicle as soon as possible after that and for that they need an appropriate tax regime. We therefore propose to make enabling provision now, with detailed tax rules to follow in secondary legislation once the non-tax background has been finalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new rules will follow the general principle as appears from the clause of equivalence with the current rules for authorised unit trusts. No doubt modifications will be needed to accommodate their different legal structure and perhaps also to reflect detailed differences in the applicable regulatory rules. For example, open-ended investment companies will be marketed on the basis known as "single pricing", as opposed to the dual pricing basis which has applied hitherto to unit trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to say more until the Revenue is in a position to get down to detailed work against a settled corporate law and regulatory background. But I can assure the Committee that the Revenue will consult widely with the industry before final regulations come forward, to ensure the tax rules meet our shared objective of securing a collective investment industry which is as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0865">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>635</span>
competitive abroad as it is at home—an important point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to those issues in just a moment, but, first, I should like to deal with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham who set out clearly the unresolved concerns about the foreign income dividend scheme. We are well aware of the unit trust industry's concerns about certain aspects of that scheme. This is a new scheme, which we introduced last year to help address a problem which some companies can face when they distribute foreign profits. They cannot set off all the advance corporation tax they pay when they pay a dividend, because, after giving relief for foreign tax, there is little or no UK corporation tax liability. Now that the scheme is fully operational, we want to evaluate how it is working in practice, and the Inland Revenue is currently taking soundings from a number of representative bodies, including the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, to see whether any amendments to the scheme might usefully be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That exercise will, of course, include a detailed review of the way the scheme works for collective investment vehicles, and we will consider carefully at the end of it whether any changes should be included in next year's Finance Bill. But I cannot, of course, make any commitment at this stage. We always knew that the FID scheme would present companies with hard choices. We need to consider further whether the choices facing unit trusts are uniquely hard and whether unit trusts might find their own ways of resolving them short of legislative action on our part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with a few of the points raised by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central. He asked about the impact of OEICs on the unit trust industry. I express the hope that it will be substantial. The development comes at the industry's bidding and it is in clear response to market demand within the wider Europe. It offers a modern collective savings vehicle that will prove at least as attractive—I hope more so—as the present unit trust regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will know that the investment trust and unit trust sectors are enormously important vehicles for large savings from many people in this country. It is important that we provide collective investment schemes that respond to long-term savings needs and keep up to date. Open-ended investment companies and the regime on which we are working will respond precisely to those needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On regulatory concerns, I inform the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central that OEICs will have limited liability. He asked whether they would be offered a similar level of protection to unit trusts. He acknowledged that they are fundamentally different in the duty of care that is owed. In a unit trust, the owner of the investment is the trustee. The assets of a trust are owned by the trustee, but they are held for the benefit of the beneficiary. In the case of a company, its members own the company and collectively own its assets. Directors run the company for them. Although both trusts and companies have within corporate law and trust law obligations and duties that should protect the interests of members, unit holders and beneficiaries, there is an important difference between a
	<span class='label label-info column'>636</span>
trust and a company, which must be recognised in the formulation of the new scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the reporting requirement on directors to members of a company should be as much as it is from trustees to unit holders. Directors of a company are charged with looking after asssets which are owned directly by members of that company. Therefore, there must be a strong reporting line of accountability between the two. Arguably, that must be stronger in a company than in trusts in which the trustee owns the assets, but has important and strong obligations towards the beneficiary. However, the important point is that those accountability requirements should be at least as strong in the case of a company, whether open ended or closed, as in the case of a unit trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us how the regulations will achieve such strong reporting lines? It is all very well to say it, but how will it be achieved in practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both the detailed product regulations, which the Securities and Investments Board will promulgate, and the regime of structural regulations, which the Treasury will promulgate shortly, will set down in a variety of ways the obligations on directors. Those obligations will be familiar to those in the normal corporate sector. They will include annual meetings and the presentation of reports and accounts, they will define the responsibility of directors and they will set out the relationship between directors and the depositary within an open-ended investment company, to name but a few aspects of the new regime. It is my strong intention to ensure that the new bodies have strong lines of accountability to the members, owners and savers who participate in such open-ended companies. The hon. Gentleman asked whether there would be two sets of regulations, and I think that I have answered that—there will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Treasury draft regulations and the consultation document on the structural approach to open-ended OEICs will be available before the end of next month. I anticipate a consultation period of possibly as much as four months. That is rather longer than the consultation period for the first document, but I believe that it is justified because we want people to consider its contents along with the proposals of the Securities and Investments Board, which will deal in more detail with product regulations. The two will go together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Treasury will set out a broad structure for OICs. The SIB will set out the more detailed product regulations. Both must be considered together. When, thereafter, we come up with more detailed firm proposals on which the tax structure will have to be based, to equate broadly with that applying to unit trusts, the first step must be to get the structure and details right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will, to use the hon. Gentleman's words, spend some time in the consultation process, because I agree with him that it is more important to get the proposal right than to rush into legislation and the establishment of savings companies that might not carry public confidence if they are seen to be defective in some way. That might mean, sadly, that the launch of OEICs may now be put off until the beginning of next year. That is later than I should have originally liked, and later than we intended, but it has taken some time to consult and to work out carefully
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0866">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>637</span>
and properly the details of the regulations, orders and rules that will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Workshops will form part of the process of consultation. They are structured, formal occasions when investment managers—those who will be running and advising on open-ended investment companies—can get together and work in sessions with officials from the Treasury and the regulatory bodies to thrash out and to understand better how the new vehicles would work. If it is of any interest to members of the Committee, I should like to extend to them an invitation to a presentation in the Treasury, or on some other opportunity, when we publish the consultative document and SIB product regulations, so that they can learn more about what we have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The development is extremely important and will be a major new long-term savings vehicle for people. It will be as important, in time, as building societies, unit trusts and investment trusts have been. We all have a vested interest in getting it right. If anyone is interested in that I should certainly like to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question has been raised of whether we should insist on non-executive directors. Listed OEICs will have to have independent directors, as investment trust companies do, but we do not propose to insist that all open-ended investment companies have non-executive directors. I was rather in favour of—and pushed for—the proposal in the initial consultation document that there should be a strong independent element on the board of the investment companies. I repeat that I hope that that will be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are distinct advantages to placing independent non-executive directors on the boards of companies, especially open-ended investment companies. However, the overwhelming response of the industry was that apart from the cost, complexity and other difficulties in obtaining appropriate people in each case, that move would be highly undesirable. I treated the response with a certain scepticism because one might have expected it, but in the end I was persuaded that if by persuasion one could induce in the boards sufficient independence, as well as enabling many of the professional companies to structure them cost-effectively, that would be, at least for the time being, a sensible way to proceed. I had very much in mind also the separation of the management of investments from the depositary, safe-guarding and keeping of investments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had thought that the Treasury had proposed that, if there was a case for an entirely independent or separate company being the depositary and looking after the assets of the company itself, while another company took care of the management, there was not the same argument for insisting on a large independent element on the board of the OEIC. So far so good, except that many of the same respondents also object to having a separate independent company as the depositary for the investments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall consider that matter carefully. I have to take account of situations such as that of Barings, which, while different, have raised the public profile of the question of the ring fencing and separation of funds, whether they be banking or investment funds, from the management thereof. That bolsters my preference for proposing that there should be a separate and independent depositary. That would be a safe, if conservative, way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>638</span>
I know that many members of industry equally strongly oppose that view. They argue "What is the point in forcing us to give the depositary to another company which might itself go bust and have problems? There is at least as much risk in farming out that function to another company as there is in keeping it in our organisation." That may be true, although the opportunity for problems to arise may compound where one organisation or holding company is responsible for both management and the depositary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not finally decided on those matters, but I have shared some of my views with the Committee. I do not wish to proceed at any great length, but this is an important clause and debate and members of the Committee deserve a detailed response to the important points that they have raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall answer a couple of other questions that were asked. Where has the Securities and Investments Board got to? I have said that it will be coming out with its detailed product rule consultation shortly after the Treasury. Who will regulate the selling of open-ended investment companies? That will come under the regulation of the Personal Investment Authority and the management of those funds will come under the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, but by no means least, I shall try to respond to the important points made by my hon. Friends the Members for Bournemouth, West and for Stamford and Spalding about the clause opening the way for a plethora of tax legislation by way of negative secondary resolution orders. I, too, am concerned about such matters. Whether we are Ministers who may have to take through those orders, or Members of Parliament, we should always be suspicious about the order-making capabilities that we implant in primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this case, the arguments of expedition and convenience and, in particular, the argument that we are seeking for the open-ended investment company sector of at least broad equivalence with the tax regime that applies to the unit trust sector, should reassure members of the Committee that we are not embarking on a vastly different landscape. We shall seek to replicate, as far as possible, an equivalent regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an important reason for that, which is that I do not want to inhibit the prospects or possibilities of unit trusts converting into open-ended investment companies at a later stage. If mere were costs involved, or if there were differential or prejudicial tax regimes applying to the open-ended investment company sector, as opposed to the unit trust sector, there would be little incentive to convert.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My guess is that, as far as listed authorised unit trusts are concerned, there will be an incentive, for marketing reasons, to convert. Certainly, many unauthorised smaller or professional unit trusts may see simplicity, convenience and cost-saving in continuing as unit trusts with existing obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, with those comments, I have replied to some of the important points raised but, because the regulations have to be taken through under the European Communities Act, I am sure that we will have an opportunity on the Floor of the House and, if not, in Committee, to discuss those matters further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am grateful to the Minister for having given an extra explanation. Obviously, we shall have to wait and see what the regulations produce, although, I think that the Minister is aware that there is general concern, which will have to be met. The only other thing that I would say is that OICs belong to the world of Richmal Crompton and not to the world of the Finance Bill and I think that they should be left in Richmal Crompton's books, rather than dealing with them in the Committee today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He may be regretting that request now, given the report in this morning's paper and the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend (Mr. Byers) has learnt something more about those questions. The Minister may be wishing that he had answered my questions last week and, therefore, made it more difficult for me to return to them this week. I was hinting at some of the issues last week, so he has had time to find the answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Serious questions are being raised about the nature of the contract that the Inland Revenue has entered into with EDS and whether that contract will be beneficial to the British taxpayer. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) is not in his place because he made proposals on the Floor of the House last week, under the ten-minute Bill procedure, which may affect clause 136. I was hoping to encourage him to discuss the costs of his proposals to the taxpayer. It is, perhaps, significant that he is not yet here this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not my normal practice to raise issues that relate to other hon. Members without having told them beforehand. I expected that the hon. Gentleman would be present when the clause was being discussed, given that he raised a ten-minute Bill on the topic last week. I apologise for the fact that I have not taken the trouble to mention it before this afternoon. There are serious questions about the costs to the taxpayer of the implications of the clause and whether the Government have thought their way through them sufficiently. Indeed, external groups tell us that the clause has not been sufficiently thought through and that the costs will be substantial. They are not sure whether the legislation should be proceeded with at this time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two issues surrounding costs—the cost of the contract that EDS has signed with the Inland Revenue and
	<span class='label label-info column'>640</span>
whether the allegations in 	<i>The Guardian</i> report are correct. Is it true that a review of the contract is already under way? Is it true that the consequences of the contract, if it proceeded as presently drafted, would mean that any change to a tax system would require 13 months notice to qualify for the cheapest rate from EDS? Is it true that four months notice would be required for the firm's standard rate of any change? It seems extraordinary that changes in tax must remain secret for so long in this country, yet we are not able to give prior notice very often because the Government need to act quickly on such issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British taxpayers will be getting a bad deal if they have to pay high charges through the Inland Revenue on every tax change so that the programme used by the Revenue for self-assessment can be amended or adapted. We want to know from the Minister what is going on. We want an assurance that the interests of taxpayers have been protected and that the Revenue will enter into contracts only if they have been checked properly to ensure that those interests have been protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The memo quoted in 	<i>The Guardian</i> this morning says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is recognised that this is a difficult task, but at present the contract ties us to it. Once resource is ordered, we have to pay for it."</p></blockquote>
It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are in danger of leaving the department open to inappropriate charging and costs."</p></blockquote>
It does not need me to remind the Committee that "we" in this case may initially mean the Revenue, but it ends up meaning that taxpayers will face inappropriate charging costs if the report is accurate. Before we proceed any further, it is important that the Government come clean and tell us precisely what problems there are in the contract, whether there is any validity in the report and, if so, what they are doing to sort it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have said before in Committee that this issue will land at the feet of the next Government. In the interests of that Government, I am determined that we should do what we can to cut out waste and excessive and unnecessary spending. We do not want to have to carry the can for poor negotiations. We want every effort to be made to ensure that taxpayers' interests are properly accounted for, that additional and excessive expenditure is not entered into and that the Government take some responsibility on the contracts that are being signed. Those contracts are not being signed on behalf of ephemeral fairy tale people, they are being signed on behalf of you, Mr. Hogg, and of members of the Committee, who are legitimate taxpayers. We have the right to make sure that the Government are watching expenditure as carefully as they keep lecturing people outside to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Considerable benefits could be produced if the Inland Revenue and all Government organisations went electronic as fast as possible. It must be a matter of regret that we cannot speed the process up. A small capital investment now would lead to great savings later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very interested to hear the hon. Member for Dover express those views. Labour Members have proposed incentives for people to return to work and—a subject appropriate to today—a national child care strategy. Both of those schemes would bring long-term financial benefits, but they have been scorned by Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating whether the contract would meet the standards in the Bill brought forward by the hon. Member for Dover last week, or whether such a mess has been made of the contract that, far from saving the taxpayer money, it will cost the taxpayer. That is the allegation in the report in 	<i>The Guardian</i> today. Of course, I believe that efficient and effective legislation can, in the long term, save money in matters such as this. But if the implementation has not been efficient, or if contracts with outside companies have not been carefully negotiated, I fear that the taxpayer will end up paying an astronomical year-on-year cost that is out of all proportion to the benefits that may accrue. We have questions about the clause that the Government must answer—I hope that they can answer. If the taxpayer thinks that the Government have wasted money by not being sufficiently careful about a contract, the taxpayer will want them to say why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to my second point, which is to ask what the cost of the proposal will be. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland argues that the entire schedule 28 should be scrapped. It has stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Consultations are ongoing between the professions and the Inland Revenue … these … are far from conclusive. In recent weeks the pilot scheme has shown up a number of problems associated with any attempt to move towards a completely paperless system, and as a bare minimum, it is probably that any electronic lodgement will be postponed. Therefore it seems premature and unnecessary to introduce enabling legislation at this stage."</p></blockquote>
I do not entirely agree with that, but before we wholeheartedly support the clause, we need to know whether the Government have costed the proposal, what is happening in the pilot scheme, and whether what is alleged by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland is true and that the pilot study has thrown up severe problems. The report in 	<i>The Guardian</i> supports the institute's allegations. We simply want to know what is happening. Will the system work? What will the cost be? What are the Government doing to ensure that the taxpayer gets the best value and the most efficient contracts? What were the Government's criteria for the contract that was signed with Electronic Data Services? Having examined the contract, are the Government satisfied?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I understand that there is to be a report from the National Audit Office in the next few days. It would have been useful to have that report in the Committee today. Presumably the Minister has seen that report, and will know what the National Audit Office and the Comptroller and Auditor General think of this matter. I want some answers from the Minister, because we want to ensure that the taxpayer is getting a good deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall just add a few questions to those raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West (Ms Armstrong). In doing so, I want to make it clear that I broadly welcome—as I think we all do—the principle of people being able to submit their tax returns electronically, and the sooner the better. In some ways, as so often in these matters, we have been rather slow. I gather that in the United States of America last year, 14 million people submitted their tax returns, or had them submitted on their behalf, electronically. That facility has been available in several states in America for several years, but we have been slow to reach that stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Durham, Northwest, I am concerned about the disparate opinions on the issue held by members of the accountancy profession. The Institute of Chartered Accountants, in its news release, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The only beneficiary of electronic lodgement of tax returns will be the Inland Revenue, says the Tax Faculty of Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The proposed legislation … will, in fact, impose further burdens on accountants with no compensating advantages for the profession."</p></blockquote>
I had a discussion with a member of the Electronic Lodgement Business Services Forum within the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which was more welcoming. It made the point that, although the advent of electronic lodgement is welcome, its use will be limited by the Revenue's insistence on seeing the accounts and applying the rules. There seems to be some division on that within the profession. I see that the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman), who speaks for the Institute of Chartered Accountants, is not in his place at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have four further questions for the Minister. First, I must raise the issue of security. Is he satisfied that the arrangements will contain sufficient safeguards to make secure the information that is conveyed electronically? Secondly—this is a point of detail—why does the legislation make provision for the special accreditation of accountants who submit returns electronically? It seems odd that it is necessary to be particularly qualified before one is able to handle transactions. I hope, at least, that that is a short-term transitional arrangement, because surely, within a year or two any qualified member of the profession would expect to submit returns electronically as a matter of routine. I would not have thought it necessary to require special accreditation except, possibly, as an interim measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, is the Inland Revenue considering any measures to encourage taxpayers to submit their returns electronically? Whatever the current difficulties with the EDS contract—I look forward to hearing about that—in the long term there must be potential for considerable cost reduction by redirecting effort to addressing tax evasion. I wonder whether consideration could be given to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0869">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>643</span>
encouraging people to submit their tax returns electronically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is to ask what is happening about the electronic lodgement of corporation tax returns. I understand that there was a pilot scheme for corporation tax, but the Government have not said what they intend to do about that. We are told in the press that the pilot scheme was intended to attract 1,000 returns, but only 30 have been forthcoming. That is somewhat reminiscent of the rents-to-mortgages scheme, with which the Financial Secretary will be familiar. Clearly, there are considerable potential benefits in adopting the same approach to corporation tax returns. Will the right hon. Gentleman tell the Committee what the Government's intentions are on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During this debate, I have no doubt that SuperJanet will make her debut in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have seen the article in 	<i>The Guardian.</i> Indeed, I read and even buy 	<i>The Guardian,</i> which is probably more than many members of the Committee can say, but that does not mean that it is always right. The article suggests that the Revenue has signed an expensive contract with EDS, which it is now trying to review. That is quite wrong; no such review is under way. The National Audit Office report is due to be published tomorrow. I hope that the hon. Member for Durham, North-West will read it; if she does, she will find that it is a favourable comment on the way that the Revenue conducted itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Revenue buys resources from EDS at competitive unit prices. The more notice that we give, the bigger the discount. That allows us to pay for the majority of our services, which are predictable 13 months in advance, at very low prices. That optimises savings by planning well in advance, but it retains flexibility. I am confident that the next Administration, which will be Conservative, will benefit from the far-sighted procurement policy upon which the Revenue has embarked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When electronic lodgement was mentioned earlier, I said that this would be the opportunity to have a short debate on that matter. I shall outline where we have reached and then respond to the points that have been raised. The clause and the schedule that we are about to discuss will introduce provisions underpinning the new system, which the Revenue is pioneering, to enable taxpayers and agents to transmit their returns to the Revenue electronically. That will dispense with the need to prepare and submit substantial amounts of paper-based information and it holds out the potential for considerable benefits for taxpayers, their representatives and the Revenue by providing an efficient and more cost-effective service. It could be the first step towards a virtually paperless process of returns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I discuss electronic lodgement, I should say something about the general issue of computer technology and its use in tax administration. Clearly, these are times of considerable development and enhancement in the sophistication of information technology. I am keen to encourage and support the Revenue in exploring fully the ways that computers can ease the burden for taxpayers and agents in meeting tax obligations. That would also allow the Revenue to benefit from the reduction of routine
	<span class='label label-info column'>644</span>
manual processes, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Timms). It would also enable the Revenue to operate with greater efficiency and to make better use of the control systems that the computer offers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Revenue is recognised as a leader in the field of information technology in government, as a result of its substantial computerisation programmes for the assessment and collection of tax. Some of the systems are now nearing the end of their working life and they will be superseded by the new system that is being developed for self-assessment. The Committee may have noticed considerable interest in the subject in recent articles in the press, which have touched on several new developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are planning to extend further the use of information technology by listening to the views of accountants and taxpayers on the benefits of that sort of approach. One example is the use of computer programmes that are designed to help taxpayers to prepare tax returns. As I said during the debate on clause 91 in Committee on the Floor of the House, some people will find that the most convenient way to complete their tax return will be to use a software product on a personal computer. Products of that type—and some are already on the market—take some of the pain out of the process not just by doing calculations, but by leading taxpayers through questions and answers to the parts of the tax return that apply to them. The Revenue is currently considering the options for making such a product widely available. As I have said, the matter is a natural candidate for private sector involvement, but the Revenue is considering a range of options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of computers to facilitate communication on a wide scale is also developing fast with the Internet system, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Dover in his ten-minute rule Bill last week. That would provide an information network between and within the private and public sectors. Inland Revenue is considering ways in which Internet could be used to provide information to those who are linked to it. Details of their press releases are already available in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that Internet could be used to transmit tax returns—that point was raised by the hon. Member for Newham, North-East. Although that is an interesting idea, confidential information would probably require a more secure system. That is why we believe that electronic lodgement, which I shall explain in a moment, provides a better way to meet the interests of taxpayers, agents and the Revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for mentioning my Bill. He mentioned the security aspect, which is critically important. Does he agree that as much tax legislation and policy documentation as possible should be made available by the Revenue over the Internet, so that every taxpayer knows which special concessions or documents the Revenue has issued? That way, we should inform as many taxpayers as possible of their rights and practice in the matters that interest them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would subscribe to that. The Treasury already makes Ministers speeches available on Internet, which I am sure awaken a great deal of interest among the millions of subscribers. That is a modern
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0870">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>645</span>
means of communication and all Departments should make the best use of it. The United States, which is more advanced in such matters, does not use Internet for the transmission of tax returns for the reason just given by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With such rapid development across the board, there is bound to be some understandable concern that the systems should be introduced with adequate testing. Let me reassure the Committee that proper testing of all new systems is planned. The self-assessment computer sytem, for example, will be introduced in four phases between October 1996 and April 1998. Detailed plans for testing the system have been drawn up and testing of the first part of the system, to be released in October 1996, will start in May this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each phase will be comprehensively tested, using the latest techniques, over many months before it becomes operational. Those who will use the system will be involved early in the testing process. The training and clerical procedures used alongside the computer system will also be incorporated into the testing programme. Any problems with the system will be identified early enough to remedy before live running. The result will be a robust system that will support Inland Revenue staff in providing an excellent service to their customers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Durham, North-West did not raise specific points, but I shall deal later with the figures that she mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The electronic lodgement system will make the most of information technology to continue the Revenue's drive to greater efficiency and to meet our commitment to improving customer services. The legislation is needed to underpin the system. The actual cost of electronic lodgement is expected to be less than £3 million. Most of the cost will be borne by the Inland Revenue, which will be developing the gateways. There might be costs for accountants who want to access it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, North-East asked me why we need to accredit people. It is expected that the vast majority of those who apply for permission to use electronic lodgement will be successful in their applications. It is in the interests of the Revenue to maximise the use of the new facility, thereby streamlining its own processes and reducing costs for everyone. However, there has to be a basis for excluding those whom the Revenue has good reason to believe might seek to manipulate the system to evade tax. That is why there is provision in the schedule to accredit people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tested the computer technology for corporation tax to ensure that we have the right system for transmitting information so that it can be encrypted and validly received and so that it can reject returns with errors and accept those with the right pass rates. The trial is due to be completed this month. It has not failed as 	<i>The Times</i> reported on 2 March. The final results will be published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are difficulties in using electronic lodgement for company accounts. There is no standard format for company accounts and a great deal of other information has to be sent with them—in particular, the company's annual accounts, which cannot be turned into a standard format. Those arguments do not apply to the same extent to self-assessment, where the majority of information can be put into standard format and electronically lodged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>646</span>
The experiment was an attempt to ensure that we had a system down which tax-related information could be passed. Without dispensing with supporting paper documents, there would be little interest in filing the corporation tax return electronically. However, a useful percentage—perhaps 5 or 10 per cent.—of the self-assessment returns are initially being electronically lodged, usually via the agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have dealt with most of the questions that have been—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Member for Durham, North-West wants to ask questions, I shall have another go later. I think that I have dealt with most of the points raised. The debate has been very helpful and has shown that the Inland Revenue is looking ahead, is making the best use of information technology, is moving towards a paperless system and is working closely with accountants and agents to produce that system. Initial results have been extremely promising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to come back on a couple of issues. In his initial remarks, the Financial Secretary did not deny that the contract that had been entered into was expensive. I suspect that one reason why was his subsequent acknowledgement that the sooner one notifies, the cheaper the cost. When it comes to notification of personal allowances, for example, in the tax regime, there may not be the necessary time to give the maximum notice—costs therefore, will be even higher. The 13-month and four-month periods seem excessive. Were there not other ways to deal with changes in rates than to negotiate a contract that provided that the sooner—I quoted four months and 13 months—that one lodges one's returns, the more effective the system will be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also asked the right hon. Gentleman about the progress of the pilot study, which was another issue referred to in the report this morning. He did not give us any indication as to how he thought that study was progressing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put a further question to the Financial Secretary on accreditation? I did not entirely understand his answer on that matter. Did he mean that the system could lend itself more readily to fraud than the conventional tax return system? If so, I am surprised and I would like to be told why that might be. If the intention is simply to rule out of the process a small number of people for one reason or another, would not it be better to identify those people instead of accrediting through the rather cumbersome procedure provided by the clause the bulk of people who would want to return their tax returns in the conventional way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If someone submits a paper return there is a signature attached to it that the Inland Revenue can examine. If a return is sent through the electronic lodgement process, there is not the same hard copy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone has a conviction or a related conviction for fraud, the Inland Revenue has the right not to approve that person's use of the electronic lodgement system. I hope that most of those who apply will be accredited. We want the right, however, not to allow people with a mischievous motive to plug into the system. We want to refuse such a person a driving licence for that part of the superhighway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be easier that way round? That would mean that a small number of people would not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0871">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>647</span>
be allowed to fill in their forms in the conventional way, instead of having to accredit the great majority of people who would be allowed, which would seem unduly costly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that that would make sense. The Inland Revenue would have to comb through all the criminal convictions of tax-related offences on a database top check up on those who wish to use the system. Given the fairly small number of agents who will initially apply for the scheme, a relatively simple approval of accreditation system is probably better. That would be better than the other way round which, as the hon. Member for Newham, North-East suggested, sounds somewhat cumbersome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure to which pilot study the hon. Member for Durham, North-West referred. There is one in Leicester that does not start until April 1995. We shall learn the lessons from that study during 1995–96 and make improvements in the light of experience for a further trial in 1996. If the hon. Lady was referring to the study relating to corporation tax returns, if she looks in 	<i>Hansard,</i> she will find that I dealt with that matter. The trial is due to be completed this month when the final results will be published. One of those answers should satisfy the hon. Lady—whichever pilot study she meant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newham, North-East mentioned incentives. We have not introduced an incentive to use electronic lodgement because that might penalise those who are based on paper returns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are benefits for those who use electronic lodgement. For example, they will receive a signal back quickly acknowledging that the information has been accepted. It may be possible to process refund claims slightly more quickly or to send tax returns down the system and into the mailboxes of those who are registered for electronic lodgement. There may be non-pecuniary or non-direct pecuniary benefits for those who use electronic lodgement, but we have not come up with a direct cash incentive because we do not want to penalise those who feel more comfortable with the buff form, which we all look forward to receiving in April.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Amendment No. 242 requires the Inland Revenue to issue a notice of the granting or refusal of approval to transmit information to it electronically. In the case of a refusal, that will provide a basis for appeal proceedings, which are the subject of amendment No. 243, should the applicant wish to challenge the Revenue's decision. The amendment, which responds to representations, helps to protect the rights of taxpayers and agents and I commend it to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 243 allows a person who has been refused approval to transmit information to the Revenue electronically, or had approval withdrawn, to challenge the Revenue's decision in an appeal before the special commissioners. The amendment helps to protect the rights of taxpayers and agents and I commend it to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, amendment No. 244 removes the requirement for a hard copy of information transmitted electronically to the Inland Revenue to be made shortly before the transmission takes place. That is supported by accountancy representatives who consider that the requirement imposed an unnecessary burden.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 137 deals with short rotation coppices. My hon. Friend the Minister of State dealt ably this morning with relief in fields that we were not all familiar with, but we are dealing now with ordinary fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Short rotation coppice is a way of producing a renewable fuel for biomass-fed power stations. Willow or poplar cuttings are planted on farm land at a rate of 3,000–4,000 per acre. They are then cut back to ground level after a year. That causes them to throw up shoots, which are harvested every three years or so and turned into chips which are used as fuel. There has been some uncertainty as to whether short rotation coppice would be treated as farming or as commercial woodland—the latter being outside the scope of income and corporation tax. It has been decided to clarify the matter in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Short rotation coppice has more in common with arable crops than with the production of timber and it will therefore be taxable as farming and excluded from the exemption for commercial woodlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As originally drafted, clause 137 covers only the income tax and capital gains tax treatment of short rotation coppice cultivation, confirming that it will be treated as farming. The amendments ensure that land and buildings used for the cultivation of short rotation coppice also rank as agricultural property for inheritance tax purposes and will qualify for agricultural property relief. That change will apply to transfers made or events occurring on or after 6 April 1995.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I simply want to congratulate the Minister on introducing two aspects of Labour party policy which were identified in 1994. The first aspect relates to inheritance tax. We said that we would introduce arrangements to protect bona fide family businesses and farms from being broken up as the result of a more effective operation of inheritance tax. The second aspect is part of our environment policy—"In Trust for Tomorrow"—in which we advocate the use of coppicing because we believe that it provides a useful source of environmentally-benign energy generation, as well as providing a use for land that is no longer required for food crops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The press release from the Inland Revenue says that the overall tax implications of that will be negligible and I should like some confirmation of that. Let us hope that the measure is used effectively by the Government. Perhaps it is another method by which the common agricultural policy can be pushed along a little way and reformed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding of clause 140 is that it will make legal, regularise, and give authority for, a practice that the Government have followed for some considerable time. The practice enables repayments of tax, including interest on overpaid tax, to be made out of tax revenue, rather than out of sums voted for tax management. I received an answer to that effect from the Financial Secretary on 17 January.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I first saw the clause, it struck me as a rather neat way of simultaneously reducing both the overall imposition of taxation and the overall level of public spending. Presumably it will have that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be interested to hear from the Paymaster General what sums are tied up in that procedure and why the need to regularise it has only now come to light. Have the Government been breaking the law since 1866? Can he assure us that the change introduced by the clause will regularise only that existing practice and not change anything else?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why is it necessary to make that change in the law now, when section 10 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866 has stood the test of 129 years? Suddenly, some lawyers say that Parliament have got it wrong or that, at any rate, the interpretation is wrong. We are told by the Inland Revenue, in their explanatory notes, that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Recent legal advice is that 'repayments' must be construed narrowly."</p></blockquote>
Why must they be construed narrowly when they have been construed broadly for 129 years and the system has worked perfectly well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The clause does not affect the amount of tax paid by any taxpayer, but it concerns the way in which the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise account for some of the payments that they make. In the normal course of their operations, both of those departments repay tax, and that may carry interest. The intention has always been that those payments should come out of the tax collected by those departments, with only the balance being paid to the Consolidated Fund. Recent legal advice says that, in some circumstances, that treatment is incorrect and that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0873">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>651</span>
payments should come out of the amount voted to the departments to cover their costs of administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear that that problem does not concern taxpayers. They are still entitled to be paid any amount owed to them by the Inland Revenue and the Customs and Excise. Under the law as it stands, those payments should be made out of voted money, but that would not be a sensible result. The payments can be large and their size and timing may be unpredictable. If the two departments had to find the payments out of their costs of administration, the amounts voted to the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise would need to be increased. Even then, their finances would be very difficult to manage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem arises because of the wording of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866. Section 10 of that Act allows the Revenue and Customs to deduct tax repayments from the amounts, that they pay into the Consolidated Fund, but our legal advice is that the term must be construed narrowly and so does not cover all the payments that they make. Exceptions include payments of VAT input tax to a trader, who is what is commonly called a repayment trader, payments of tax credits attaching to dividends to exempt taxpayers such as pension funds and payments of interest on tax by the two departments. The clause will extend section 10 to allow such payments to be deducted from amounts due to the consolidated fund. That means that the payments will not have to be made out of voted money. We have made the clause retrospective because, on the basis of recent advice, the Revenue and Customs are now seen to have wrongly accounted for such payments for many years. Those errors were inadvertent. Therefore, it is right to correct them retrospectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield asked why the 1866 Act should not stand as justified and without the need for amendment. I remind him that in 1866, VAT was not even a gleam in the House of Commons' eye. Indeed, VAT and the imputation system of corporation tax, which is the other tax affected, came in only in the early 1970s. Technically, therefore, incorrect payments have been made only since the advent of those two taxes. It is not the fault of legislators of more than 100 years ago that they did not foresee such eventualities. So that members of the Committee do not become too partisan or self-righteous, I remind them that the technical error persisted through Governments of all complexions. The last Labour Government were just as culpable as the present Government in not spotting the technical error.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Paymaster General agree that given that the Conservative party has been in office longer than the Labour party, it should accept a greater share of the blame? Will the hon. Gentleman also answer my question, namely, how much money is repaid under this mechanism?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No detailed calculation has been made because the change that we are inviting the Committee to make does not affect any taxpayer. The amount must be large because the first example that I gave was of VAT input tax, which is commonly paid to repayment traders where their input tax exceeds their
	<span class='label label-info column'>652</span>
output tax. In some cases, the sums are large. Over the years since 1973, a very large sum of money would be involved, but there is no need or point in going right back to the origin of VAT to calculate the total sum. Members of the Committee must all agree that it is a technical adjustment and that no one is either advantaged or disadvantaged. We are simply putting the law back to the position it was always assumed to be. Indeed, the legislators in 1866—if they had had foresight—would have allowed for such an adjustment when drafting the original legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend tell us more about the recent legal advice? Was it solicited and, if it was, why was it? If it was not solicited, why did anybody take any notice of it? Why do we need interfering busy-body lawyers telling us that we have got the legislation wrong when it has stood the test of time for so long?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat that the clear intention of the original Act was to allow all appropriate repayments to be made out of tax revenue. With the evolution of tax through time and, in particular, the advent of the imputation system of corporation tax and VAT, it was not spotted that, technically, repayments due under those systems of taxation and interest payments on the repayments were not properly covered by the 1866 Act. The error only came to light, almost inadvertently, during the prosecution of a court case last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield may be right—if we fail to make the correction, no one will be disadvantaged and we could sail on regardless. However, I think that it is right that, when an error is spotted, we should make the necessary correction to the law. Otherwise, the next time that it is spotted we could not say that the error was purely an oversight. Now that we know of it and have an opportunity to correct it, I invite the Committee to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Hoon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ashfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We often have discussions about retrospective legislation, although I do not think that I have come across retrospection that covered 129 years before—there is always a first time for everything. What difference would it make in practice if we eliminate the retrospective element and simply change the law as of today? Would not that be a more judicious way of proceeding?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The retrospection does not, in practice, go back to 1866—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When does it go back to?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have explained already. In those days, there was no VAT system and, therefore, no repayment traders receiving those payments. In practice, it should have become an issue only when VAT and a certain change to corporation tax were introduced in the early 1970s—which gave rise, in due course, to the repayments that were not covered by the 1866 Act. It seems sensible to validate the years since the early 1970s, but there is no great issue of practicality here. In principle, when the Committee spots an error it is in everyone's interest to put the law back to what had always been the intention and good practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Paymaster General's explanation has been wholly satisfactory. He
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0874">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>653</span>
did not tell us back to what year we were correcting the law. On my reading of the clause and judging from the Minister's attempt at an explanation, that year would be 1866, because presumably the tax authorities—the Inland Revenue or Customs and Excise—have always had to pay back some money, leading presumably to a gradually increasing, cumulative and, recently, huge sum of money being paid back without parliamentary authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The serious point that arises is that to deal with the matter in that way escapes normal parliamentary scrutiny of the Consolidated Fund. I invite the Minister to explain what scrutiny we can make of the repayments in addition to what would be available as normal scrutiny of the Consolidated Fund, and what difference would be made—as my hon. Friend the Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon) asked—if we were not to correct the matter retrospectively. Could a claim be made that Parliament had not discharged its duty properly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, there would be no practical difference at all. If the Committee is determined not to make the measure retrospective, we can look at the matter again, but I think that that would be unnecessary and unwise when we have an opportunity to validate what has always been the intended practice. I emphasise that originally after 1866 all the necessary repayments under the tax systems of the time were covered and the tax authorities therefore had legislative cover to make repayments out of the tax receipts and not out of the vote from the Consolidated Fund. All that we are doing is carrying forward that intention to include more recent taxes. I continue to invite the Committee to do that. The practicalities do not present any great issue because no taxpayer is affected and there is no possibility of a claim being made by any taxpayer, dead or alive, who might be said to be disadvantaged by any failure to make the measure retrospective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General has offered an interesting explanation for taking the issue back to 1866 and also of the effect intended by Parliament then. He has told the Committee that Parliament had no notion at that time, even as a gleam in its eye, of the taxes that are now causing problems. If those taxes were not thought of by Parliament, how does the Paymaster General know what effect it intended the clause to have on them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must own to not being a great student of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866, but I do know, broadly, that it was drafted to make it legal for all repayments to be made out of tax revenue. However, payment of input tax to repayment traders is not, strictly speaking, a repayment of tax. That is the legal advice that we have received. It may be a narrow point, even one that we could challenge, but it is more sensible for us to give legal effect to what would clearly have been intended at the time—that all repayments or their equivalent under VAT, or other taxes that have arisen since, should be legitimised and made legal. I persist in inviting the Committee to make the change. It may be slightly unusual—but is not, for that reason, undesirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the Paymaster General's explanation lacking in the detail and justification that we should have expected, not least with regard to the

That Act sets out the mechanism by which trust ports can be privatised. Part of that mechanism provides that before a trust port is privatised the business of the port concerned may be transferred to a new company. The privatisation will then be achieved by a sale of that company's shares. Under the Ports Act, half of the proceeds of the sale of the shares had to be paid to the Government who collected them as a levy. The clause permits the Government to reduce the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0875">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>655</span>
assessment from 50 per cent. to whatever level they choose. It also provides for a right of appeal by the court if a reduction is sought and refused by the Government and allows the payment to be deferred pending reconsideration of the appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why, after four years, have the Government decided to reduce the moneys collected for the public purse from the privatisation of the remaining ports? The Government originally decided, in debate on the Ports Act 1991, that they should receive a substantial proportion of the proceeds made by the imposition of the 50 per cent. levy. That was justified on the basis of the money that the state had invested in those ports over a period. Opposition Members objected to that; we wanted the money to be returned to local communities around the ports, so that they could reinvest the money. Those communities had also invested a great deal of money in their local ports. We seek an explanation of why the Government have decided to reduce their take from the sale of the remaining ports. Under what circumstances would that reduction be justified?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also contained in the Ports Act 1991 are provisions under which if, for instance, land associated with a port is sold for land speculation—thus allowing a much larger profit to the company that now owns it—the Government can impose a further levy on that land. In the absence of any earlier explanation, I should be grateful to hear the Financial Secretary's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Any effect the clause might have on such a MEBO would concern many people in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Representing an entirely landlocked constituency as I do, I make no claims to expertise in relation to the ports levy. However, it seems to me that new section 15A gives Ministers what I would have described in a previous age as an arbitrary power—no guidelines are given as to how the Minister will exercise the considerable responsibilities given to him in respect of the various ports. For example, subsection (2) says that the Minister may have:
	<br><blockquote><p>"reasonable grounds for believing that the amount of the assessment may be excessive,"</p></blockquote>
but I detect no indication of how he is to determine that. Moreover, subsection (4) states that the Minister may:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in any other case, if he thinks fit…confirm or reduce it."</p></blockquote>
Down the ages, Parliament has resisted such arbitrary power being granted to Ministers. To follow on from my hon. Friend—the hon. Member—I hope that that will be stricken from the record on the grounds that it may come back to haunt me. The hon. Member for Dover said that no one will be in a position to know how their liabilities
	<span class='label label-info column'>656</span>
may arise. That will allow the Minister to provide, in a quite arbitrary manner, different levels of assessment for different ports without any particular reference to the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause does not do the exciting things that Opposition Members think it might. It does not change the 50 per cent. levy; it does not change the amount that the port pays; and it does not change the amount that the Government receive. It enables the Government to obtain earlier what is due to them. We are doing this in response to pressure from the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee. I shall explain exactly what the clause does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause inserts a new section 15A into the Ports Act 1991 and repeals a group of sections of the Finance Act 1990. The inserted section 15A supplements the existing provisions for the assessment of levy on the disposal by certain port authorities of the securities of their successor companies. It empowers the appropriate Minister to reduce an assessment on his own initiative or on a request by the authority within the specified period. It enables a port authority to appeal to the courts against his decision on a requested reconsideration. It empowers a Minister to defer payment of part of the amount assessed pending reconsideration or appeal and makes consequential repeals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background is that the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee criticised the Department of Transport for the delay in collecting the Government levy from each of the four trust port privatisations that took place in 1992 under powers contained in part I of the Ports Act 1991. The NAO was concerned that the total levy payments of £114.6 million were deferred for six months while costs amounting to £1.6 million were disputed. The Department felt unable to issue an interim assessment for the amount of the levy which was not in dispute because its understanding of the Ports Act 1991 was that only one assessment was permitted. The NAO questioned that and recommended that in future the Department should issue interim assessments for amounts not in dispute. That is what the clause does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legal advice given to the Department was that the position set out in the Ports Act 1991 was far from clear and the new provisions will correct the position ahead of further privatisations under the Act. That would not impact on Dover unless the constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Dover had a dispute about how much of the proceeds of the sale were due. I cannot say whether that would arise on the sale of Dover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause simply enables the Government to get their hands on what they are owed at a slightly earlier stage than was permitted initially. Otherwise, it is entirely neutral.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
