<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome you to the Chair—I believe that this is the first time that you have presided here since the Committee started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor of the Exchequer is making two speeches this week. One will be made today when he will highlight the divisions in the Cabinet on the question of a single currency. The one to which I want to draw attention was made on Tuesday night when he discussed a number of matters, including a change in the way in which financial legislation is drawn up. He suggested that it would in effect be privatised and that barristers would be brought in to draft it instead of the parliamentary draftsmen who are employed by the Treasury. It was not clear whether the Chancellor intends that to be introduced this year or in the future. Legislation could be greatly improved, but as barristers cost around £200 an hour, it is not clear what savings would result for the public purse. Can we expect outside legal advice on the current Finance Bill which might lead to amendments being made by the Government? Perhaps the matter could be clarified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman probably knows more than I do about the cost of legal fees. Nothing that is said by any Chancellor of the Exchequer is a matter for the Chairman of this Committee. I could not and would not dare to advise the hon. Gentleman on the matter that he raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hilary Armstrong 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Durham, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 115, in page 24, line 41, leave out

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 117, in page 24, line 45, after "business", insert "in that capacity".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Hogg, to the Committee. I know that you started the day well in the Tea Room and you have now come to the reason for that substantial start. The amendments and clauses that we are about to tackle are the most impenetrable and technical that I have had to deal with. If I were being flippant, I would say that it is boring stuff. I shall do my best to lighten the burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are coming to clauses that are amendments to amendments to amendments to previous Acts and will change the way in which a small group of people deal
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>160</span>
with the taxation of land. When studying the clauses last night I wondered if this was what the good folk of northwest Durham had elected me to do. I wondered what they would think of my spending so much time on trying to understand a long, 13-page clause which is, I understand, intended to simplify legislation. It is hard to see how language of such complexity will ease the burden of the taxpayer who is trying to understand the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Historically, income derived from land has been dealt with under a separate schedule, different from those dealing with other sources of income. The object of the proposals is to put schedule A on as close a footing as possible to schedule B case I—I told you that this was an interesting subject, Mr. Hogg. Amendments Nos. 115 and 117 were tabled because people outside the Committee who are interested in such measures have raised specific issues with us which we want to explore. The Minister, in trying to simplify, may be able to help us to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 115 and 117 relate to a person who receives schedule A income from several properties in more than one capacity—for example, personally in respect of one property, as a personal representative of one or more deceased persons in respect of another, and/or as a trustee of one or more trusts in respect of a third property. Under the clause, all that income would come into one pot, which is not the way in which persons in several capacities are currently taxed. I can see that I am engaging your attention with these interesting and exciting matters, Mr. Hogg. The amendments are designed to simplify and clarify the system to a greater extent than the clause does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary could deal with a point raised by the Institute of Taxation about the clause and the attached schedule. As the hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Ms Armstrong) said, it seems ironic that more than once in the Bill where the Treasury is attempting to simplify taxation the result is extremely complex legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute of Taxation says:
	<br><q><p>"The amendment to the Schedule A charge to treat rent etc. received as a single business is welcomed as it will lead to a simplification of a complex area of tax law. However, an opportunity has been lost to implement the same changes for corporation tax. If the intention is to simplify a complicated area of tax law and make it easier for those liable to income tax to compute their income from property and to assess it under the new self-assessment regime, then the same must hold true for corporation tax under Pay and File.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>We believe that the maintenance of two differing sets of rules for income and corporation tax will lead to confusion, especially as the same Sections will contain two different forms of the legislation, one for income tax and one for corporation tax. If it is considered necessary to maintain the two sets of rules, then the legislation for each should be independent of the other."</p></q>
That raises two different points. First, why must we have two sets of rules—one for income tax and one for corporation tax? Secondly, if we are to have two sets of rules, can they be separate so that the legislation is clear?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could start by reminding the Committee of the interests that I have already declared in the register. I am an adviser to NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of the NatWest group; I am a director of Dewe Rogerson consultants; and I am the parliamentary adviser to the

Institute of Taxation in which capacity I was delighted to hear the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). I tried to listen closely to what the hon. Member for Durham, North-West said, but I am still not entirely clear what the intended effect of amendment No. 115 would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a particular interest in the matter, which is not of a personal or financial kind: on two occasions I have moved a new clause in the finance legislation, which would have had the effect of abolishing schedule A altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) for his support—he is an expert in real estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->It seems to make no sense, either in terms of economics or of equity, to tax business activities that are based on the exploitation of real estate on a basis that is different from that of other business activities. All such activities are equally useful. Schedule A is a curious historical relic in taxation legislation, and I have done my modest best over the past few years to question the rationale of its continuing to be in that legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that background, I welcome the decision of my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury to introduce in the Bill about three quarters of the reforms that I have been trying to realise. As I understand the clause—and I agree with the hon. Member for Durham, North-West that it is extremely obscurely expressed—its effect will be to ensure that schedule A income is computed on the same basis as schedule D. But those who enjoy schedule A income will not, when they trade as individuals, have the same capital reliefs that would be available to them if they traded under schedule D. What, therefore, is the reason for going three quarters of the way down the road of reform, but denying people the capital reliefs that they would enjoy if they engaged in any business not involving real estate? I might mention retirement relief, roll-over relief and business relief in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will ensure that individuals who trade as principals and who enjoy schedule A income will have that income assessed on the same economic basis as if they were trading under schedule D. I welcome that reform. However, that reform has not been extended to companies or incorporated persons anywhere in the Bill, so far as I can see. What is the logic of reforming the legislation in relation to individuals who are engaged as principals in real estate activities, but not reforming it as it applies to companies? Does not that introduce an extraordinary distortion between those who trade as principals and those who trade as incorporated persons? Is there any rhyme or reason for that distortion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the Taxes Act 1988 was not meant to induce people to change the basis of their trading activity from incorporated to non-incorporated, or the other way round. It is not the business of that legislation to introduce that kind of economic distortion into the structure of business in this country. I cannot see any rationale for not extending the welcome reforms to the incorporated sector. I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary for the useful reform that he has introduced, and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
I am glad that he has gone as far as he has done. However, will my right hon. Friend explain why he decided to stop some way down the path of reform? Why not go that last mile down the path?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made an honest attempt to follow the argument of the hon. Member for Durham, North-West. I am slightly bemused by the proposed impact of the amendment. I agree with her that some peculiar anomalies will be thrown up by the Government's decision to go so far down the road of useful reform, but no further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have no knowledge of a specific case to illustrate that, I shall use what might well be a realistic example. An individual is in partnership with a company in exploiting an agricultural estate, of which part of the income is derived from agricultural activity—and therefore subject to schedule D—and part is derived from let land, which is subject to schedule A. Will the portion of the profits attributed to the individual all be computed on a schedule D basis? Is it also the case that that individual would not be allowed the capital reliefs in respect of the part of the income deemed to be derived from schedule A? Curious questions of that sort will be raised by the anomalies created by the useful reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute of Taxation, which I have the honour to advise, will discover that its members gain a considerable increase in their incomes as a result of sorting out some of those questions, unless we receive clear answers to them when debating the Bill. The institute shares my opinion that we should take a longer-term interest in such issues for the sake of all those engaged in advising business and commerce. We should deplore unnecessary tax anomalies and deplore unnecessary costs of compliance being imposed on those engaged in legitimate and useful business activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in this morning's debate we will be able to establish the greatest possible measure of clarity on what might otherwise be regarded as confusing additions to the Taxes Act 1988.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Legg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly endorse the comments made by my hon. Friends the Members for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) and for Beaconsfield. I also welcome the attempt at simplifying this measure in relation to income tax. The main motivation behind the measure is that income tax will soon be worked out on a self-assessment basis and it will help those taxpayers who have to compute their income in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should note that corporation tax is moving to a pay and file basis. If there is a rationale for simplifying the system because income tax is moving to self-assessment, there is also a rationale for simplifying the system regulating corporation tax as it moves to pay and file. It is curious that, with the Taxes Act 1988, we will now have two sections 15—one to cover income tax and one to cover corporation tax. The hon. Member for Durham, North-West referred to the complexities of tax matters and the confusions that arise. But two sections 15 will not add to the understanding of that Act and will not help the business man, or his tax adviser, to conduct affairs efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we continue with the present corporation tax regime we shall not be flowing with the current of deregulation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0599">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>163</span>
being pushed by the Government in many sectors. In preparing the corporation tax computations, taxpayers and their advisers will have to adjust rental income, which has been prepared on a trading basis, to an actual basis. If they could use the same system as that advocated for income tax, there would be no need for such adjustments. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will consider what my hon. Friends and I have said about further simplification in order to reach some conformity between the systems for income tax and corporation tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also interesting to note that, under the new arrangement, non-resident companies will have a choice of regimes. They may decide either to trade under the income tax regime or to set up a company in the United Kingdom and be taxed under the corporation tax regime. We seem to have established a system in which there is not equity between overseas and UK corporations. I believe that the Government should give this part of the Bill further thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not sure whether the hon. Members for Milton Keynes, Southwest (Mr. Legg) and for Stamford and Spalding supported the amendment. It is important and useful in that it tidies up a complicated clause in an extremely complicated part of the Bill. I read through the clause last night and, as the Chief Secretary mentioned last week, I have some experience of living and owning property overseas. I tried to consider the implications of the clause to determine how it would operate in other countries of which I have experience. It is the most complex piece of legislation that I have ever seen and I speak as someone who has filled in tax forms on a self-assessment basis in other countries; but I shall come to that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to draw the Committee's attention to the worrying implications of the intervention by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding, who made a passionate appeal for investment in property, income from property and property as a whole to be treated on a par with income from other business activities. That was certainly the drift of his remarks. If we are seriously to consider that, we need a wider debate, perhaps on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main problems faced by the UK in the past 15 years has been the steady drift away from what one might loosely call income from work—that is, income from exchange value, from adding value, as opposed to income from forms of rent, whether those rents are overseas dividends, transfer payments—because they, too, are a form of rent provided by the state—or forms of investment in property. Figures I saw recently suggest—I should be grateful to be corrected if I am wrong—that 60 per cent. of income in Britain is generated by work and 40 per cent. comes from forms of rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that all forms of rent are work free or that all forms of rent do not represent, at some stage, some added value to the economy, but as we move from being a nation that earns its living to a nation that no longer does so because it secures forms of rent for its income, we are seriously adjusting the balance between a successful and a dependent economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman realise that rental income is so often income from assets that have been built up by those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
who have worked to buy or create those assets? Surely he realises that, in which case his distinction is somewhat phoney.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point about rental income is the balance. Logically, if we pursue the argument of the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman), and become a society entirely made up of rentiers, we would all be blissfully happy. But, unfortunately, in the real world—we encounter every day in our surgeries the victims of moving towards a rentier society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has genuinely misunderstood the whole issue of schedule A. Nobody is suggesting that capital relief should be available for investment income. My argument, which I have made before in this Committee, is that the active management, development and maintenance of property is a legitimate business activity involving the same amount of work and risk-taking as any other. There is, therefore, no logical reason to treat the income of persons or companies involved in the active management of property in a different way from that of other businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would, for the first time, allow the income of individuals involved in the active management of property to be computed on the same basis as schedule D, but they are denied capital reliefs. The clause incorporates no reform of that anomaly for companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fundamentally disagree with that perspective. It can often be difficult to draw a division in a property business which ranges from the owner of a small flat who treats the rent as an addition to a retirement benefit to the giant property companies, some of which appear in the Register of Members' Interests. If we open the door to allow investment in, and management of, property to be treated on an equal footing with the creation of businesses that add value, export goods and create extra employment, we will make a fundamental break from a principle of taxation that has held good for hundreds of years. That principle certainly holds good in most other advanced democracies, where there is a clear divide between the treatment of the management, investment and running of land and that of industrial, manufacturing and service businesses. I do not see how one can justify giving the same roll-overs and retirement reliefs to property speculators and investors in land that are given when somebody has to sell a factory or business that they have built up, or is dispossessed of it by compulsory purchase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the wider point that we have to look more seriously at the taxation of wealth under our tax regime. Wealth is mainly expressed in our society through the ownership of property, whether a house or a piece of land. I received this morning a letter that the Financial Secretary very kindly wrote to me about remarks that I made on venture capital trusts. I shall take up his offer of more information and further briefing, but, again, I should like him to consider a comparison with other more dynamic and successful economies in which property is subject to a wealth tax which treats it as part of one's patrimony rather than focusing on the revenue that might be obtained from it. Although no amendments have been tabled on that subject, perhaps we might return to it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0600">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>165</span>
Finally, I invite the Committee to support the amendment because, unless the Financial Secretary can explain the meaning of the adjective "particular", it would close—I see smiles on the faces of some Conservative Members—a possible loophole which may not have been intended by those who drafted the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sir George Young)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join others in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Hogg. Your heart might have sunk a little bit when the hon. Member for Durham, North-West said that there was something unexciting about clause 33 and schedule 6, the debate on which you preside over.

Friends the Members for Beaconsfield, for Milton Keynes, South-West and for Stamford and Spalding.

In the speech of the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) I noticed a hint of a wealth tax on anyone who owns property. It will be interesting to hear whether people who own property in this country would be subject to an annual wealth tax on the value of that property under a regime on which the hon. Gentleman for Rotherham is working. I am sure that the Opposition Front Bench team will want to reflect on that proposal and on whether they want to endorse it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause and schedule make changes to the income tax rules which apply to the taxation of income from property. The hon. Member for Durham, North-West will be pleased to know that they simplify a complicated area of taxation and will make it easier for those liable to income tax to compute their income from property and to assess it under the new self-assessment system, which comes into force in 1996–97. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West was right to make that link.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be pleased to learn that the changes have been welcomed by a wide range of representative bodies in consultation, and by a number of commentators and individuals as an example of real simplification. In order to prepare for the new system of self assessment, the changes will take effect from 6 April 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the clause and the schedule is to move away from the present artificial approach, which defines what receipts are caught and what expenditure is deductible, and ring fences income and expenditure according to the type of lease. In future, the starting point for the computation of income from property will be the application of commercial accountancy principles, as mentioned by my hon. Friends. The commercial profit will be adjusted under the computational rules that apply to trading activities. That does not mean that they will be taxed as a trade, and I shall present the argument for that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, income from property situated in the United Kingdom is taxed under schedule A, and income from furnished lettings is taxed under schedule D case VI. In future, for income tax purposes, it is proposed to bring all income from property situated within the United
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
Kingdom within the new rules for schedule A. Under the new approach, all that income will be pooled and expenditure incurred in earning that income will be allowed against the pooled income. That represents an enormous simplification and saving of effort for taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes introduced do not apply for corporation tax purposes. I was asked why that was the case. The reason is that at present companies have scope for sideways relief against other income for some property-related expenses through the charges and management expenses routes. The new schedule A approach would mean that, in future, companies would have all their property expenditure ring fenced as a schedule A deduction. They would therefore lose the flexibility that they have at the moment, which is why we have restricted the changes to income tax payers. The flexibility has been welcomed by many companies that would be denied that flexibility if we moved to a ring-fenced system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my right hon. Friend will agree that, were he simply to abolish schedule A entirely and tax all businesses' commercial activities on the basis of schedule D, he would solve his own problem. Companies would have the greatest degree of flexibility when examining costs and setting off their total costs against their total business revenues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right in that there is logic in what he says. But there are powerful reasons for not abolishing schedule A, one of which is that it would cost the Government about £450 million and at present we are not in that mode.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee may find it convenient if I mention in passing the Government amendment to schedule 6, although I shall move it formally later. The new schedule A regime imports the rules for computing trading profits. One of those rules is contained in section 82, which restricts the relief due to traders for interest paid overseas in certain circumstances. That provision would effectively make it impossible for landlords paying interest to nonresident lenders to qualify for a deduction against their rental income. It was not our intention to deny landlords a relief under the new schedule A regime to which they were entitled under the old regime, which was why the Government tabled the amendment. It is designed to restore the position and to ensure that rental businesses that borrow funds from abroad can continue to receive relief for the interest that they pay to non-residents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of complexity, the pooling of income and expenditure so that property sources of income are no longer individually ring fenced for income tax purposes will make life simpler. We believe that the changes are a simplification, which will be welcomed by income tax payers—the changes have already been welcomed by a wide range of representative bodies and several commentators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendments moved by the hon. Member for Durham, North-West is to ensure that, when an individual carries on more than one business, but in different capacities—for example, alone and in partnership, or as a member of two different partnerships—those different businesses will be deemed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>167</span>
to be one business, chargeable to tax under schedule A. That, I believe, is the import of the amendments, which have received some support from Conservative Benches. The concept of new schedule A business is that any number of schedule A businesses that are carried on by a person on his or her own account should be treated as one business. If one individual has many properties they will be pooled and treated as one business. That is separate from any schedule A business that is carried on in partnership. The partnership business will be treated as a different business from the one that is carried on in an individual capacity. In that sense, the businesses that a person carries on in a single capacity will be treated as a single business under the clause. However, we cannot accept that businesses that are carried on in different capacities should be treated as a single business. They are different businesses, and it would be too great a friction to try to treat them as one. The approach that we adopted in section 21(4) follows the case I treatment of farming businesses, by which any number of farming businesses that are carried on by an individual are treated as one. However, if a farmer carries on farming activities in different capacities, he or she will be treated as carrying on a separate farming business in each.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If schedule A businesses were treated as one, losses arising from individuals could be offset against profits arising to a partnership, and vice versa. That would be more generous for schedule A than is the present treatment of losses that are carried forward either for farming or for case I businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some technical deficiencies in amendments Nos. 115 and 117. They do not deal with the fact that business accounts may be drawn up on different fiscal bases, and those accounts may not necessarily tie up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dealt a moment ago with the point that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding. He asked why we would not extend the changes to corporation tax. At present, companies have scope for sideways relief against other income for property-related interest which is relieved as a charge. Investment companies have similar scope for those expenses of management that do not come within the narrow old schedule A expenses rule. Those companies that are members of groups have the further opportunity of setting their unused sideways relief against profits of fellow group companies. If the Government were to adopt the suggestion of my hon. Friend, the new approach to schedule A would prevent companies from relieving property-related expenses other than through ring-fenced relief against their own schedule A income. Companies would not want to lose these facilities. That is why we have restricted the proposed changes to income tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The treatment of companies without the new schedule A regime is, overall, still more generous than that for individuals within the new schedule A because companies will retain the charges of management expense facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend took his argument a step further, by suggesting that one could make income from property trading rather than investment income. The changes to schedule A are designed to simplify the rules for calculating profits in preparation for self-assessment. They do not address wider issues, such as the treatment of income from property as investment income. In any event,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
the present treatment of landlords as investors of property reflects the long-established distinction in our tax system between earned income and investment income. I accept that a landlord might put much time and effort into managing property, but rental income is derived less from what the landlord does than from the property itself. The rental income is a return on the capital invested in the property in much the same way as a dividend is a return on shares or securities. I am afraid that I cannot travel that last mile, as my hon. Friend invited me to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the member for Stamford and Spalding asked a complicated question about mixed partnerships of companies and individuals. The short answer to a long question is yes. Individuals will be taxed according to the new rules and the company will be taxed according to the old rules. For a partnership, there will be two computations; one by reference to income tax rules, to calculate the share of profit chargeable on the individual partners, and the other, by reference to corporation tax rules, to calculate the share of profit chargeable on the corporate partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, on the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West, I am not sure that he was right to say that non-resident companies have a choice of income tax or corporation tax regimes. They will have a choice only if they become resident or form a resident subsidiary. I agree that it is not ideal to have two sections with the same number, but the provisions make it clear which section applies to income tax and which to corporation tax. I hope that that is helpful to the Committee and not too complicated. I invite the Committee, if pressed, to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
to reflect points raised by the Institute of Taxation in its commentary on schedule 6. As has already been said, the schedule is very long and the institute suggested that there was some scope for simplification. There is much to be said for removing redundant parts and cutting the size of the Bill. The institute said that section 26 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 was redundant. Amendment No. 108, which was not selected because it was defective, was intended to get rid of that section.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The institute also made a point about paragraph 18 of schedule 6. It said:
	<br><q><p>"it is rather disappointing to note the effective preservation of the old rules relating to schedule A loss relief. If the intention is to treat schedule A as a quasi-trade, which appears likely, given the amendments incorporated in schedule 6, then we submit that loss relief should follow the normal trade rules."</p></q>
On that basis, I propose that we remove paragraph 18 from schedule 6 and reduce the size of the Bill accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend has said, the amendment would shorten the Bill, but there are good reasons for retaining section 379A. The amendment proposes to delete section 379A on the treatment of schedule A income tax losses. Broadly speaking, at present, excess schedule A expenditure on unfurnished property can be carried forward to a subsequent chargeable period, provided that the period is within the currency of the same lease. Case VI furnished lettings losses can be allowed against other case VI transactions of the same or later years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the new schedule A income tax regime is to do away with those artificial ring fences and to pool income expenses on both furnished and unfurnished property. The proposal in section 379A is that schedule A income tax losses will be carried forward against future schedule A profits. Any unrelieved schedule A losses under the old system and unrelieved case VI furnished letting losses at the changeover will be converted into a new schedule. A loss will be available to set against schedule A income for 1995–96 and later years, so the loss regime will be slightly more flexible than it is at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield does not, as far as I can see, provide for a replacement rule on schedule A losses. If his amendment were passed, there would be no mechanism for relieving losses, which would cause some difficulties. I am not sure why my hon. Friend might wish to do that. I hope that I have explained that it is in the interests of taxpayers to have such a mechanism and that he will not press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 119, in page 25, line 45, leave out "Board" and insert "Treasury".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the amendment, we simply ask that the drawing up of the regulations under the clause should be the responsibility of the Treasury rather than of the board of Inland Revenue. It is a minor adjustment, but, in a sense, it reflects the democratic deficit that we address whenever it appears. We do not understand why the Government wish to delegate authority from Parliament to the Inland Revenue to write the rules for the collection of tax. As long as we recognise that Parliament should have broad responsibility for such issues, it should be responsible for the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary has talked about the importance of these clauses in terms of self-assessment. When such profound changes are being introduced, authority should rest with Parliament and the Treasury rather than being delegated to the board. Such delegation to outside bodies that are not directly accountable to Parliament has led to all sorts of difficulties in other cases. The clause may be only a small part of the far-reaching changes, but, in the interests of safety and to ensure that we can tackle matters when we need to, authority ought to rest with the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 42A of the Taxes Act 1988 confers very wide regulation-making powers, including provisions relating to the basis on which appeals against the decisions of the board of Inland Revenue can be made, so the board would be responsible for more than just the regulations. Our point is a small but important one and I hope that the Government will accept the amendment to give the powers to the Treasury rather than the Inland Revenue. The Law Society feels particularly strongly about the issue and we know from what the Chancellor said yesterday or the day before that he intends lawyers and accountants to have more direct say in the business of, and the drawing up of, the Finance Bill. We need to ensure that that authority rests with Parliament and the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Milburn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Darlington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support my hon. Friend. The amendment is minor but extremely important. It has the great virtue of being understandable by members of the Committee, so the debate, unlike the previous one, will inform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the second time that I have spoken about regulations and the delegation of powers from the Committee and Parliament. In previous debates, I expressed concern about the way in which the Finance Bill contains powers to make law by regulation which will take from us, as public representatives, the ability to amend Government proposals. We have now reached a stage further and a stage worse. Not only will the Committee have no rights to amend the law, but Parliament as a whole will cease to take a part in the framing of extremely important regulations.

Clause 34 on page 25, lines 45 and 46 of the Bill gives the board of Inland Revenue substantial powers for
	<br><q><p>"charging, assessment, collection and recovery".</p></q>
Indeed, my hon. Friend made the important point that the board will be given powers to decide on the appeals procedure for appeals against its own decisions. During the past year, Parliament has been much vexed about such powers being delegated in other legislation, most notably the long-running debate about the Child Support Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not learnt any lessons about how important it is that, in taxation matters, the Committee and the House get full sight of the issues on which we vote. I would find it difficult to back proposals that enshrine in law the power for the board of Inland Revenue to make important regulations before we see those regulations in advance. I hope that, in his reply the Minister will give a favourable response to the amendment which would restate the authority of the Committee and Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Hoon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ashfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to repeat the arguments already used by my hon. Friends the Members for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) and for Durham, North-West, but merely to talk about the matter of appeals. The board of Inland Revenue is notorious among lawyers for pursuing its appeals as far as they can possibly go. Even when it has lost in the house of Lords, the recent practice has been to introduce amendments to subsequent Finance Bills to correct previous decisions of the courts about which the board is unhappy. Sadly, from year to year, we see examples of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington said, the real danger of the provision is that it gives wide-ranging powers to the board to change the regulations for appeals and to use the extensive powers set out in new section 42A. That will short-circuit the need to return to this Committee and to Parliament in order to change the law. I regard that as an extraordinarily dangerous power. The principle underlying our law has always been that Parliament delegates only procedural powers to institutions such as the board of Inland Revenue, not the substantive power to make law. That is a dangerous development: I urge the Committee to reject it and accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two members of the Committee touched on the question of appeals and we shall come to that later when discussing another group of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not keen on the amendments before us. I shall explain what the clause does and why the procedure for regulations follows precedent in giving the power to the Inland Revenue instead of the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause concerns a deduction-at-source scheme and, as is usual with all such schemes, it leaves the administrative details to be made in regulations by the Board of Inland Revenue. It provides greater flexibility for the future, making it easier for the arrangements to be updated and improved when necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is part of the self-assessment package and is one of a number of measures in the Bill to simplify the procedure for taxing non-residents and to align them with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
self assessment. It paves the way for the introduction of arrangements under which income of non-residents from property in the United Kingdom will be taxed through deduction at source. That will split the collection of tax from rents payable to overseas landlords into two clear and simple steps. First, the agent for the property or, where there is no agent, the tenant, will deduct at basic rate from the rent, net of any allowable expenses met by the agent or tenant. Secondly, when that does not result in the right amount of tax, there will be a final settling up with the non-resident through self assessment. For nonresidents who keep their tax affairs up to date a further simplification will be allowed. They will be able to choose, by agreement with the Inland Revenue, to pay tax wholly through payments on account and balancing payments under self assessment. There will be no deduction of tax at source in those cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new rule will replace the present arrangements under which non-resident landlords are taxed through their tenants and agents from the start of the 1996–97 tax year. They do not affect the tax charge, but they rationalise the way in which it is collected. The new arrangements will be simpler and more efficient for all parties concerned and have been welcomed by representatives of professional advisers and property agents who act for non-resident landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations to which the hon. Lady referred are concerned only with the administrative arrangements for the collection of tax at source. They do not affect the tax liability of the non-resident, which is determined under the rules in the previous clause which we have just discussed and other provisions. As with other such deduction schemes, it is right and proper that the regulations should be made by the Board of Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be consultation on the regulations before they are laid. The main proposals were developed in consultation with the representative bodies on the self-assessment consultative committee. Consultations are continuing with representatives of property agents of overseas landlords and with members of the self-assessment consultative committee on the administrative details which appear in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee will know, regulations concerned with administrative matters are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny before they are laid; they are laid under the negative procedure, but they can then be examined by Parliament when, and to the extent that, Parliament chooses. That is a sensible arrangement which avoids taking up parliamentary time unnecessarily with administrative detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warwickshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seemed that the Minister did not reply to the issues that were raised. In reading his brief, he did not reply to the concerns of my hon. Friends, which I and the Law Society share. Perhaps I should declare an interest as a member of that august body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter before us is one of principle. Now section 42A of the Taxes Act 1988 confirms very wide powers, including provisions relating to the basis on which appeals against decisions of the Board of Inland Revenue
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0604">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>173</span>
are made. It is an important issue of principle: whether we should breach long-term questions of natural justice concerning people not being judges in their own cause. The Board of Inland Revenue will have the right to decide the basis upon which appeals are made. It is no good the Minister saying that he will put on one side the issue of appeals because we shall come to it later. We shall come to it in a different way, but on this occasion we are dealing with who sets out the rules. There will be a democratic deficit if the board is allowed to make the rules. The Treasury should exercise the degree of control that we expect because the Treasury is far more accountable to Parliament—albeit in an occasionally limited way—than is the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of Parliament will be able to complain, criticise and question more effectively if the Treasury makes the rules than if the board makes the rules. Our concern is that if we pass that power to Inland Revenue officials who are pursuing their trade in the best way they know, both for their own purposes and for the purposes of collecting taxation for the Government, they may well fashion complex rules that suit the best means of administration without exhibiting the good common sense that Members of Parliament exercise on occasion. Members of Parliament are more likely to say, "This is much too complex; it is not what the ordinary citizen wants. He will not understand this and we must simplify the system".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expressed that concern in the previous debate. We did not succeed in unravelling some of the complexities—albeit for what may have been good reasons—but at least those complaints could be made. If the making of rules, especially on fundamental matters such as the way in which appeals are carried out, is moved one step away from supervision by Members of Parliament, that ability to simply complain about complexities in the way things are done is diminished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not deal with that issue in his reply. He did not deal with the whole question of appeals, which is fundamental to the amendment, and is not a matter that we can debate later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am worried about the Financial Secretary continuing to describe the arrangements and regulations—especially under new section 42A—as administrative. Clearly some—indeed, I am prepared to concede the majority—of the items contained in those regulations could be described as administrative, but some simply cannot be so described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about the board's ability to introduce important changes to regulations—not administrative or marginal changes, or changes simply to speed up the administrative process, but fundamental and important changes. Therefore I would argue strongly that the provisions of new section 42A cannot be described as procedural or administrative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my hon. Friends referred to the specific area of appeals. I find it difficult to understand why, after all the problems that have been encountered in that area and all the statements about the credibility of the Government
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
and of Parliament, the Government are still determined to pursue a course that will inevitably lead to that credibility being fatally undermined. I ask the Financial Secretary how it can be right that the board not only takes the decisions, but has the responsibility to decide the basis of appeals against those decisions. This is not a party political issue, but one of credibility. How can it be right for the same organisation that has taken a decision then to construct the basis on which an appeal against that decision is to be pursued? That inherent contradiction will lead inevitably to the undermining of the credibility of that organisation and of Parliament. I ask the Financial Secretary to consider that point extremely carefully when he responds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It therefore follows that, as well as that fundamental point being addressed, the appeal process should be put on a statutory basis from the outset and not left to the discretion of the board, as the current drafting would allow. I was accused of talking about a multi-faceted whammy the other day, but here we have a triple whammy. First, the board decides what the taxation will be—in interest or whatever. The second whammy is that when a person appeals, it is the board which decides the basis of the appeal. The third whammy is that, as far as I can see, it is discretionary whether the appeal should go ahead. I am sure that the Financial Secretary will correct me if I am wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat: the issue is not a party political one; it is a fundamental issue of the credibility of this important area of taxation. The question is whether Parliament should, at the appropriate stage, be involved in determining what regulations should be applied where, rather than leaving it to an obscure board. More important, that board should not be responsible for deciding the basis of any appeal against the decisions and, following from that, once the issue is clarified and, I hope, accepted by the Government, it should be put on a statutory basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 120, in page 26, line 2, leave out
	<br><q><p>"has his usual place of abode outside"</p></q>
and insert "is not resident in".
<br><br><!-- lb -->This amendment is another that has been suggested by the Law Society. The Government should consider it carefully, because it involves a disagreement about the meaning of the words in the legislation. It is the lawyers who will interpret the legislation, and if they are worried that the words in the Bill do not mean what they think that the Government want them to mean, there might be some trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lawyers have told me that "usual place of abode", which is used elsewhere in the Taxes Act 1988, is a somewhat archaic expression and is not necessarily confined to non-residents who do not reside in the United Kingdom. Clause 34 involves an enforcement mechanism, and needs to be applied only for payments to non-residents. It is the Law Society's view that the wording of the legislation should say what it was intended to say, so that there is no lack of clarity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate to disappoint the hon. Lady again, but I invite the Committee to reject the amendment. Deduction at source will apply where the landlord's usual place of abode is outside the UK. As the hon. Lady said in her opening remarks, the same wording is used in other provisions of the Taxes Act 1988—for example, in relation to the deduction of tax at source from payments of interest to persons outside the UK. The words have stood the test of time. They work well elsewhere and it is sensible to be consistent and to use the same test here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an additional problem with the wording proposed by the hon. Lady. The test to be applied under the clause is to be applied by the person required to operate deduction at source—the tenant or property agent in this case—so the test must be one that the agent or tenant can apply. The agent or tenant will generally know
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
whether the landlord lives in or outside the UK, which is what the current wording asks, but he may not know whether the landlord is resident in the UK for UK tax purposes because that would require insight into the landlord's personal tax affairs, to which neither a tenant nor an agent would normally be privy. That is why we believe that it makes sense to stick to the existing wording rather than using the phrase suggested by the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to push the Committee into the internecine warfare that is clearly taking place among the legal profession over definition.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In some senses, we have already debated the amendments, in that they specifically relate to appeals. As my hon. Friends have already said, we believe that the whole issue of appeals should be treated seriously. Those people who are responsible for determining the terms of an appeal should not be the same as those who have responsibility for hearing the appeal and carrying out the preparatory work. Therefore, we do not believe that regulations to appeals should be left to the discretion of the board of Inland Revenue. There should be clear provision made by Parliament for anything relating to appeals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While resisting the amendments, I hope to be able to give the hon. Lady a helpful reassurance, which may lead her to withdraw her proposals. The amendments are unnecessary and could create uncertainty about the operation of the deduction at source scheme. Subsection (4) of the new section 42A sets out a list of provisions which may be included in the regulations. As is usual with regulation-making powers, they are expressed in broad terms and the detail is contained in regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The list includes provision for appeals with respect to questions arising under the regulations. I assure the Committee that the regulations will include full provision for appeals, but I do not believe that it would be helpful to make them mandatory, given the broad terms that are necessarily used. It would not necessarily add to taxpayers' rights, which will be fully protected by the regulations. Against the background of that assurance that the regulations will include full provision for appeals, I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 35 deals with income from overseas property. It changes the income tax rules applying to the taxation of income from such property by aligning it with the taxation of income from property within the United Kingdom, which we agreed when we discussed clause 33. We have received representations from the Law Society and the Institute of Taxation about the clause. The amendment reflects the representations from the Law Society and would delete the words,
	<br><q><p>"which is treated for the purposes of that subsection as if it were a Schedule A business"</p></q>
and replace them with,
	<br><q><p>"the profits of which are to be computed in accordance with the rules for Schedule A businesses pursuant to S65(2a)".</p></q>
That is another interesting, comprehensive and riveting amendment. Amendment No. 124 would delete the word "actual".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society does not accept that there is any justification for a distinction being drawn between overseas and United Kingdom schedule A businesses. The society in unclear whether the intention is to deem all non-UK property to be managed as a single business. Clause 33, which we have now agreed—and with the provisions of which clause 35 seeks to draw overseas property into line—refers to "any estate, interest" and so
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
on, not to all estates, interests and so on. It is intended that the application of the schedule A computation rules to overseas property income results in new section 21(4) applying, so that all foreign property income is aggregated for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government claims that new section 65A(1) refers to
	<br><q><p>"any business which is treated for the purposes of—</p></q>
section 65(2A)—
	<br><q><p>"as if it were a Schedule A business".</p></q>The Law Society claims that that is incorrect and that section 65(2A) does not treat any business as a schedule A business, but requires overseas property to be computed in accordance with schedule A rules. The society says that the reference should be to the profits, which are to be computed in accordance with rules for schedule A businesses, pursuant to section 65(2A).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, Mr. Hogg, that is extremely technical, but it is an issue that the lawyers feel the clause, as currently drafted, does not get right. Our aims are to make sure that the Government have thought the matter through and that the clause actually does what they intend it to do. It is in the interests of pursuing that aim that the amendments were tabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful if I put the debate in the general context of what the clause sets out to achieve and, hopefully, pursuade the hon. Member for Durham, North-West that the amendment is unnecessary. The Law Society seems to have replaced the Maples memorandum as a source for Opposition Members speaches on the Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 35 concerns the taxation of income from property situated outside the United Kingdom. It introduces clear computational rules which broadly follow those which are being introduced by clause 33 for income from UK property. The provisions—like many others in the Bill—are necessary to pave the way for the introduction of self assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Income from an overseas property is assessable under case V of schedule D as
	<br><q><p>"income arising from possessions out of the United Kingdom".</p></q>
Typically, the property is a holiday flat which has some private use, and is let for part of the year. Usually, the income is also liable to tax in the country in which the property is situated, and credit has to be allowed against UK tax on it for the foreign tax paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, there is a lack of statutory guidance on the way in which this income should be computed for UK tax purposes. Relief is in practice given for some reasonable expenses. But the courts have found that interest on a loan used to purchase an overseas property is not allowable in computing the amount of income chargeable to tax; and relief for losses is available only on a concessional basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That position has been criticised as unfair as it can result in income being taxed without relief being given for the expenses of earning it. Moreover, from 1996–97 taxpayers will be required to assess their own liability to income tax under the new self-assessment regime, and will be subject to penalties if they make mistakes. It would clearly be unreasonable—and impractical—to expect them to do that without providing clear rules on all
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0607">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>179</span>
aspects of the assessment of income from overseas property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is logical to adopt for those purposes the rules that are introduced by clause 33 for the taxation of income from property situated in the United Kingdom. That will mean that taxpayers will in future be able to claim relief for all expenses that are incurred "wholly and exclusively" in the generation of income from an overseas property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may include interest on a loan to buy the property, but only if, and to the extent that, it satisfies the "wholly and exclusively" test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to prepare for the self-assessment regime, most of the changes will take effect from 6 April 1995. The remainder will have taken effect by 6 April 1998. The provisions will have a negligible effect on Exchequer receipts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions of the clause will bring the tax treatment of income from the letting of overseas property more into line with that from the letting of United Kingdom property. They will remove a perceived unfairness in the present treatment, and provide taxpayers with the clear rules that they need to assess their own liability under the self-assessment regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 123 and 124 are drafting preferences that were proposed by the Law Society, and would not have a substantive effect. I have been advised that the wording in the Bill achieves precisely the same results as the wording in the amendment, and should be preferred because it is more helpful to the reader. On that basis, I invite the hon. Lady not to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. If I understood him correctly, the reform would provide a more generous tax treatment to owners of second homes abroad, who may choose to take income by way of rent. Typically, people in that situation use their home abroad for their own use for two or three weeks in the summer, and rent out the property to others for the rest of the year. That would constitute the business that is referred to in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are determined to hit hard those people who are struggling to pay the mortgage on their first home in the United Kingdom. Does the Minister think it right to make a concession to those with second homes, when mortgage payers in the United Kingdom are paying more for their mortgage, by having their tax reliefs restricted? Why are the Government making that concession to people who probably have a home in the United Kingdom, as well as a second home abroad?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I explained when I moved the clause, the Government are trying to bring the taxation of property outside the United Kingdom on to the same basis as that inside the United Kingdom. In the example that the hon. Gentleman gave, if the second home happened to be in the United Kingdom, the owner would get relief for interest, but if the property were outside the United Kingdom he would not. It is difficult to defend a situation whereby one is taxed on income as a business, but one cannot set off against it some of the expenses that are incurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
I want to make it clear that there is no tax relief for private expense. Relief for expenditure will be due only when an owner carries on a business of letting an overseas property, and expenditure will be allowed only in the computation in the tax on the income from that letting, and only to the extent that it is incurred "wholly and exclusively" in earning that income. It will not be available to set off against any other income that the taxpayer has. It is ring fenced. It brings the treatment of property outside the United Kingdom into line with the treatment of property in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I enjoyed hearing that the existing wording simplifies matters and helps the reader.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause provides that the value of accessories designed solely for use by the disabled and fitted to a company car shall not be taxed as a benefit in kind. As drafted, the clause is either sloppy or miserly and misguided and I would not suggest that the Financial Secretary is any of those. I achieved a certain notoriety at the Liberal Democrat conference of 1992 by referring to him as a "very nice man". I hope that he will be a very nice man today and accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it stands, the clause allows tax relief on the benefit of certain adaptations made to company cars, for example, had accelerators, joysticks or other gadgets, widgets or gizmos—I am not sure whether "gizmo" is a parliamentary word, but it is in the spellchecker of my word processor—specifically added to a vehicle in order that a disabled person can drive it. A box on top of a car with an electrically powered mechanism to enable a driver's wheelchair to be carried around would be allowed under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would add to the eligibility criteria certain standard options that a particular disabled person
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0608">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
needs to be able to drive. I am thinking in particular of automatic transmission, power steering and electric windows, but hon. Members may be able to think of other options that should also qualify in particular circumstances. My hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale (Ms Lynne) is especially keen to make seat warmers eligible for people who suffer from illnesses related to cold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday I spoke to my constituent Susan Townsend about the clause and the amendment. Mrs. Townsend suffered from polio as a baby and as a result has only one leg. She is now in her 40s and has had over 40 operations for various complaints. She is capable of holding down a job and she has a car with a wheelchair box on the roof, but because she has only one leg it is impossible for her to drive a car without automatic transmission and power steering. Her husband Tony has a weakness in his arms and needs a joystick to drive a car. Mrs. Townsend pointed out to me that a disabled person who uses a hand accelerator or a joystick is also likely to need electric windows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the amendment, especially his estimate of the cost to the Treasury should it be accepted. I do not believe that it will cause a run on the pound. Surely we should, in principle, remove barriers to employment for people with disabilities. It is in the Treasury's interests for a disabled person to be employed and pay taxes rather than sit at home drawing benefits. The amendment would increase the chances of some disabled people to gain employment and I commend it to the Committee for that reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our amendment No. 125 is grouped with amendment No. 81. I support amendment No. 81 and will speak in support of our amendment No. 125.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides that accessories which convert a car for a disabled person are to be excluded from the accessories which increase the assessable benefit charged. The exclusion applies only to equipment designed solely for use by a chronically sick or disabled person. The Financial Secretary has received representations from the Automobile Association and the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation about the problems experienced by disabled car users who need specific alterations to their cars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty with the clause is the use of the word "solely", meaning for sole use. Although amendment No. 81 attempts to clarify that, we are not happy with it because although it deals with the principle, it does not use the definition "chronically sick or disabled" which is specified in other legislation, in particular the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970, which is used as the touchstone for defining who is liable for consideration. The clause does not define a chronically sick or disabled person. I presume that the Inland Revenue will interpret that phrase in the light of precedents set in VAT matters where the same wording appears in group 12 of schedule 8 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994. It is important that the Financial Secretary confirms that the definition will be taken from the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are left with the problem of the use of the word "solely". The hon. Member for Cheltenham (Mr. Jones)
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
mentioned circumstances in which automatic transmission or the addition of power steering to a vehicle, although intended for the use of a disabled person, was in fact not solely used by that person. Nor would the addition of seat warmers be used solely by the disabled person; they would benefit anyone who sat in that seat. The same would apply to electric windows or assistance to turn the steering wheel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The AA and RADAR have told the Financial Secretary that there is an anomaly in the provisions. Disabled drivers are discriminated against in tax legislation vis-à-vis able-bodied drivers because the changes that they require are counted as adding value to the vehicle and they are taxed accordingly. The AA and RADAR pressed the Financial Secretary on that. In the third paragraph of his reply to Bert Massie of RADAR, the right hon. Gentleman makes it clear that the changes are a direct response to representations received about the anomaly arising from the taxation changes last April and that the Government intended to ensure that alterations that were solely for the use of a disabled person would be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that all hon. Members accept that the Government are trying to provide regulations to ensure that disabled drivers are not discriminated against. However, by using the word "solely" in the Bill, they have inadvertently provided for discrimination against certain groups of disabled people. Given the Government's commitment—and, I hope, their support for the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill which will come before the House on Friday—I hope that even if they cannot accept the amendments, they will agree to look again at the clause and reassure the Committee that disabled people will not be discriminated against.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I oppose the amendment. Although some members of the Committee may say that that is not surprising, I wish to make it clear that I am committed to improving the conditions of disabled people. Disabled groups in Sutton can bear witness to the representations that I have made on their behalf. I am concerned with the broader picture and, in particular, the precise wording of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the clause, which will be very much appreciated by the small number of disabled people who have a company car that has been adapted for them. Such adaptations have, until now, been regarded as a luxury rather than a necessity. It is quite appropriate for the Government to make a clear distinction between the two and to give every possible assistance to companies that want to help disabled people. Disabled groups to which I have spoken have said that they very much appreciate the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger arises if we take a broad definition. The clause rightly uses the words:
	<br><q><p>"designed solely for use by a chronically sick or disabled person".</p></q>
It is clear at whom those words are aimed. The amendment refers to enabling
	<br><q><p>"a sick or disabled person to use the car",</p></q>
which gives a much broader definition of "sick".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who can be defined as sick? It could be someone with flu or someone with an illness that does not really affect

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
their ability to drive, but which could be used as a lever to obtain concessions for useful and attractive accessories that can also be used by able-bodied people. Electric windows, for example, are a luxury to some and a necessity to others, but they can be used by the able-bodied. Relying only on the expression "sick" leads one down a long and awkward avenue. "Chronically sick", however, clearly refers to those who come within the definition of the registered disabled. Even within that category, there are sub-divisions; one can refer also to people who are "severely handicapped"—if I may use a term which some might describe as politically incorrect, but which, to my mind, is the clearest in terms of meaning.

One can find oneself going down a very awkward avenue. For example, someone who has a broken arm could be described as disabled in the context of the amendment. A broken arm heals; it is a temporary condition. The clause as it stands clearly refers to a permanent, long-standing condition that will not get better. I am genuinely concerned that the amendment could open the way to people who are not genuinely eligible obtaining the concession. It could also lead to litigation and dispute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The clarity and precision of the clause prevents our going down an avenue of argument, debate and dispute, and prevents people from gaining access to facilities to which they have no right. In this highly contentious area, it is absolutely essential that we are clear in our own minds about who is chronically sick or severely disabled, and that we stick to that definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Milburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Lady read the wording of amendment No. 125? Her concerns appear to be about the definition contained in amendment No. 81, and she is right to be concerned. That definition includes the word "sick" and may therefore be deficient, but the whole thrust of the hon. Lady's argument has been that she will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
support any provision that includes the definition "chronically sick". Therefore, I presume that she supports amendment No. 125, which stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not a clear interpretation of my remarks; in fact, the hon. Gentleman is simply attempting to twist my words. I am saying that when trying to provide facilities for disabled people it is important that we make totally clear who qualifies. The term used in amendment No. 81 is so broad and vague that it would create more problems than it solved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite frankly, I am amazed at the speech of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, and I shall refer to it during my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try not to choke on the words, but I want to congratulate the Government on moving at least some way toward amending the Taxes Act 1988 in the provisions that we are currently debating. The taxation of benefit in kind and the definition of accessories contained in the clause are undoubtedly steps in the right direction. There is no argument between the Government and myself on that. I wish to make that clear before I continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "solely" is the problem. Far from being quite clear and very precise, the current wording is exactly the opposite, as a number of examples given by hon. Members have shown. I am sure that many of us could call on our own experiences of contact with people with disabilities and I shall speak briefly of mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My agent of many years was a paraplegic. The best way for able-bodied people to understand better the problems faced by people with disabilities is to have such an experience, as I am sure we all agree. His car had to have a wide door so that he could get in and out from his wheelchair. Had it not been for that wide door, he would not have been able to get in and out; but it also enabled me, with my bulky frame, to get in and out. It was vital for my agent that that adaptation was there because he was paraplegic, but it was not solely for his use because I could use it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that, although it may not have been solely for his use, it was designed solely for his use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Chief Secretary gives us that interpretation it may go a considerable way to allaying our fears. I look forward to the Financial Secretary qualifying that point, which I recognise is important. However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman accepts that, while the door may have been designed solely for the use of my agent, it could also be used by able-bodied people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the amendments, we seek to take a further step and build on the Government's changes to the 1988 Act, on which I congratulate them. The definitions in the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 are an excellent basis on which to clarify further the wording of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it—this is an important point and I would welcome some comment on it from the Financial Secretary—the present wording puts the onus of proof on the person with a disability in the event of a dispute over what could be considered to have been designed solely for their use. For many years, people with disabilities have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0610">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>185</span>
been faced with having to prove their disabilities rather than society accepting that it needs to prove the contrary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The onus of proof is entirely the wrong way round. If I understand the wording correctly, the burden remains on people with disabilities. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam shakes her head. If I am wrong, I look forward to being so advised by the Financial Secretary because it is an important point. Why should disabled people, who suffer enough in their everyday lives—in this instance, we are talking about the benefit in kind of company cars—once more bear the burden of proof? We should address that very important issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify what he means by the burden of proof? Is he suggesting that the disabled person should decide on the degree of his disability? Does he not agree that it would be more appropriate for medical experts to analyse the degree of impairment and say how much assistance is required?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my contention is incorrect—and I repeat that I look forward to some clarification on the point from the Financial Secretary—there may be merit in what the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam says. But if my contention is correct, we should examine the whole system that places the burden of proof on disabled people. I accept that it is a complicated area and I am not trying to simplify it. However, it seems that the burden of proof to show that an accessory is designed solely for the use of a chronically sick or disabled person rests with that person. In principle, that is the wrong way round. Indeed, I would quote in support of my opinion the words used by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam when she said that if we were not careful, we would encourage the not genuinely disabled. Most, if not all, Committee members are fortunate enough not to suffer from chronic sickness or disability but, for many years I have listened to people who do suffer in such ways and I know that they are heartily sick of able-bodied people telling them about disability and the problems faced by the disabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Olga Maitland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the definition is so broad that those big lists of 6.5 million registered disabled could include someone who suffers from minor attacks of epilepsy or someone who has lost a digit or two? It could be something very minor and such people should not be treated in the same way as someone who is chronically sick and disabled. The hon. Gentleman is trying to put them all together and make minor disabilities equal to major ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never cease to be amazed at the hon. Lady's ability to construe an argument where none exists—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] She is entitled to her opinion and we are entitled to disagree with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat, because the hon. Lady does not seem to have heard me, that the definitions in the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 are a good basis on which to begin to examine the question of the burden of proof. She demeans the debate when she suggests that we want people with flu or a broken arm to benefit. Are we being asked to take such comments seriously? They do no good
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always appreciative of hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was commenting on what the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said about people with flu. The intervention by the hon. Member for Cheltenham puts her comments in context. It is ridiculous for the hon. Lady to introduce such arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect to the hon. Member for Cheltenham, who moved amendment No. 81, I believe that amendment No. 125 has greater merit because it refers to
	<br><q><p>"a chronically sick or disabled person"</p></q>
which brings into play the definition contained in the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. I am not an expert on that Act, but I suspect that its definition does not include people with flu.
<br><br><!-- lb -->I was encouraged by what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South. She referred to the interpretation that she believes is being placed on the subsection that reflects the definitions contained in various regulations covering VAT. If that is the case—and we would welcome confirmation of that—it would appear that the Government have accepted that the words "designed solely", which are to be inserted in the subsection, are in need of further clarification. Amendment No. 81 and my preferred amendment, No. 125, would assist the Government; they would not be an obstacle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my constituency there is a very active branch of the disabled drivers' club. Within that club, which I have supported for many years, many courageous people have been able to overcome considerable disability so that they can work. My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam referred to disability being permanent or temporary. I could give examples of people who have been seriously injured in car accidents who have eventually overcome very severe disabilities, including spinal injuries. The debate is rather sterile because such matters are adequately defined in

legislation and it is not necessary to dispute who should qualify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great sympathy with the amendments. Perhaps the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham goes a little too far in that it does not deal with chronic sickness and disablement—that is defined in other legislation. I prefer the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith). I shall listen carefully to what my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary says on whether the amendments are necessary to achieve the objective that Opposition Members and I want—that any adaptations that are necessary for disabled people should not create liability for a tax charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Oxford, East—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman used the word "necessary", which is in the amendment. It will be interesting to hear whether the Financial Secretary supports the amendment. We agree in principle on the group to be identified; our discussion concerns the currency of the words. I hope that if both sides agree on a matter of principle and one side comes up with a better form of words, they will be accepted. I hope that the amendment will not be opposed simply because it came from the Opposition. I hope that the Financial Secretary will consider the significance of the words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is a great dispute between us on what we want to achieve. I am not sure that the amendment of the hon. Member for Oxford, East would achieve what we want because the test should be whether the vehicle is being supplied to an employee who is chronically sick or disabled. At the moment, the clause seems to apply the test to the adaptation rather than to the person who is the employee in receipt of the benefit of the adaptation. Perhaps neither of the amendments would achieve what we want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has touched on an important point. Nothing in the clause states that the company car must be used by a disabled driver, so any company car with an automatic gear box would be eligible for the relief under amendment No. 125. If it was altered to have an automatic gear box, that would be a "related" alteration "necessarily installed to permit" certain categories of disabled people to use the car.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the point that I was trying to make. My hon. Friend is right in saying that there is a danger of that interpretation being made. I do not believe that any member of the Committee wants that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to hear my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary explain whether we are adequately ensuring that if a disabled employee has a company car which has been adapted to enable him to drive the car for the purposes of his employment, that will not give rise to a tax charge. If neither the clause nor the amendments will achieve that, I hope that my right hon. Friend will undertake to table a suitable amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Liddell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monklands, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause relates directly to company cars that are amended and accessorised to assist the disabled, and only a very small number of people will be affected. What projected revenue is associated with the reform? The comments of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West suggest that there is a broad consensus on the subject. Notwithstanding the comments of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, the Government should show a degree of magnanimity. The projected revenue is likely to be extremely small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On first reading the clause, my initial reaction was to give the benefit of the doubt to the Government, which is not something that I do regularly. It appeared that the clause had been drafted without fully taking into account its impact on the disabled. If a company employer—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Lady was not trying in any way to be churlish about the Government's proposals. We should all accept that the Government are trying to do something that is thoroughly desirable. Although the Government's efforts might not achieve every objective, we should be grateful to the Government for the effort that they have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I must clarify the situation. I said that when I initially read the clause, I felt a degree of magnanimity towards the Government. However, that was somewhat reduced when I heard the speech by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, which seemed to be a little out of kilter with other comments on the clause. Her tone was rather different from that of the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an employer allows his or her property—the corporate property—to be amended in such a way that it can be used by a disabled person, and if that employer is magnanimous enough to allow the family of that disabled or chronically sick person to use the vehicle, it seems rather unfair of the Government to intervene by using the taxation system to disadvantage those people, who are already disadvantaged enough. I shall not detain the Committee further on this matter, but I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would explain the rationale behind the proposal, and give us an estimate of the revenue that is likely to be collected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause relates to company cars. I do not know how many disabled people drive company cars. However, the proposal is obviously a modest one when it is put in the context of all the policies that the Government have advanced to make transport generally more accessible to disabled people. I welcome the proposal to have low-floor buses and to make all taxis accessible to disabled people. It is obviously also important that cars should be adapted to cope with the particular requirements of the disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the clause, which is a useful step forward. It will ensure that when a disabled person has a company car, which has had equipment added that is, as the Bill states:
	<br><q><p>"designed solely for use by a chronically sick or disabled person",</p></q>
the money that was used to add the equipment will not be added to the value of the car to arrive at the taxable benefit. That is the main effect of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interestingly, the clause does not state that the car must be driven by a disabled peson. For instance, if the car were given to an employee who was able-bodied but who had a wife who was disabled, it would still be possible for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>189</span>
him to benefit. That seems to be entirely reasonable. Although I am sympathetic in principle to what the amendments are trying to achieve, the problem is that neither the clause nor any of the amendments refers to the person who will drive the car. Therefore, when a car is changed in some way so that a disabled person can drive it, the amendments would disallow that amount for the purposes of taxable benefit, even if no disabled person were to drive the car. If a manual car was converted to an automatic, that conversion would come within the wording of amendment No. 125 because it would be an alteration necessarily installed to permit a disabled person of a certain category to use the car. I support the clause as it stands because although the amendments are well intentioned, they go too far and might allow a form of tax avoidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is appropriate that we are debating this amendment on the day when many of our constituents are likely to be lobbying us later about civil rights for disabled people. These issues arouse enormously strong feelings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make two brief points about the clause and the amendment. First, as I understand it, both the clause and amendment No. 125 relate to precisely the same people in precisely the same terms—bodi name
	<br><q><p>"a chronically sick or disabled person"</p></q>
as the beneficiary of the change. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said that amendment No. 125 widened the scope, but I do not agree. The terms of use by the clause and that amendment are identical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I have a question. If a person needed a car with automatic transmission in order to drive it, would the cost of fitting automatic transmission qualify under the terms of the clause as it stands? I think that it would be argued that automatic transmission is not designed solely for use by chronically sick or disabled persons. Therefore, at first sight, automatic transmission would not qualify under the terms of the clause, whereas it would qualify under amendment No. 125. That is the benefit of the Opposition amendment and that is why I support it. If the Financial Secretary can tell us the cost of automatic transmission and similar alterations would qualify under the terms of clause 38, that would be helpful, but the amendment standing in the name of my hon. Friends appears to do the trick in a way that the clause as it stands does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree with some of the points made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield about the precise meaning of the clause, and I shall demonstrate why. I have some sympathy with his comments on the Opposition amendment. I hope that we shall eventually get to the point where the Financial Secretary is willing to re-examine the form of words used in amendment No. 125, which achieves what most people want to be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the phrase in clause 38, "designed solely for use", is that the adverb "solely" applies to both the design and the use. The equipment must be both designed solely for and used solely by a disabled person. In other words, no one other than the disabled person can, should or will be able to use that particular adaptation. If some other meaning was intended—that the word
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
"solely" applied only to the design—then it would be in another place; the phrase would be "solely designed for the use of. That would carry different connotations; where the adverb is placed has an effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government's intention is that the adaptation must be designed so that a disabled person, and no one else, would have it fitted—such as a larger door, as mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson)—the words "solely designed for use by a disabled person" would have been used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as the wording stands, I do not believe that a larger door would fit within the definition of "designed solely for the use" because other people could use that larger door. I do not think that the Government intend to exclude such adaptations, which differ from adaptations such as hand controls that aid those who have difficulty with exerting power on pedals. Such controls require additional attachments on the steering wheel and special training is needed to use them. No one else can easily drive a car that is fitted with those adaptations. Hand controls such as those I have described would fit within the Government's definition, but the larger door would not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Financial Secretary will give some thought to that. There may be a genuine problem with the wording, which excludes some adaptations that he might want allowed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point about the word "solely", but that was not my point. I understand that equipment might be for the sole use of a disabled person, but would a car? Would it be right to allow automatic transmission if a car was not to be used by a disabled person?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a reasonable point. We might consider whether our amendment is so wide that it would cover all automatic transmissions, which would permit a disabled person to drive a vehicle even though it may not be intended for a disabled person. I was trying to think of parallels to compare with the difficulty of examining adaptations that are made to meet the needs of disabled people. Certain adaptations may be such that anyone could use them, even if they choose not to, but they are a necessity to disabled people and not a luxury, as was suggested by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only parallel I could think of was the regulations that apply to council tax—to which there are exceptions for adaptations to a property that enable a disabled person to use it—which result in the banding of the property being reduced by one band. Those regulations are based on the criterion that the adaptation must be required to meet the needs of any qualifying individual. The word "required" is important. Perhaps we should consider not only the design but the use to which an adaptation is put and the needs of the individual. Perhaps we could add to amendment No. 125, which deals with the problem from the point of view of the needs of the individual, the words, "and required by that individual."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the approach taken by the council tax regulations governing adaptations for the disabled. It is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0613">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>191</span>
sensible approach because judgment as to whether an adaptation should qualify is made on the ground of whether it is required by the individual rather than on whether it is solely designed for and solely used by a disabled person. The latter approach is unduly restrictive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To give one further example, I return to adaptations to the steering wheel to allow an individual who is unable to use his feet to accelerate and brake the car—an adaptation falls within the Government's definition. If power steering is added to such a car—in many vehicles it is essential for an individual who must also steer the car by an additional adaptation on the steering wheel to enable him to manage the controls—would the power steering qualify under the Government's rules? Power steering is not only designed for the use of a disabled person but, without power steering, the other hand controls added to a car for a disabled person would probably be ineffective. There are complications and the Government's wording does not deal with them. We may find that the wording restricts the use of the discretion to give adaptations to disabled people and enable them to drive their cars.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

One point that has not been made is that this provision is especially important for those who are chronically sick and disabled because, if they are in work, they are most likely to require a car to get to work.
