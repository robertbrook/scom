<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was explaining before we adjourned that the tax approval rules for occupational pension schemes are very flexible and allow what is generally regarded as a reasonable replacement of income when people retire. That is why the maximum pensions that a tax approved scheme may pay are related to earnings in the period leading up to retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general limit on such pensions is two thirds of final salary. There is no magic about that figure, but given that the controls on occupational pension schemes relate mainly to the money that can be paid out rather than the money that is paid in, some limit is needed. Two thirds of final remuneration is generally considered to be reasonable. I remind the Committee—although I am sure that many members are aware—that the cost of the present reliefs on pensions amount to no less then £7 billion a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>734</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should make plain, as I tried to do during my original speech on the new clause, that I do not quarrel with the two thirds rule. The question is, two thirds of what? Should the two thirds rule be two thirds of final salary, although the effort made by the pensioner during his working life would be better reflected by a higher level of earnings which he might have received before that period? The issue is whether the two thirds rule should be applied merely to the final salary or to the best years of employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend will allow me to continue, I shall touch upon, if not answer, his detailed concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax reliefs cost £7 billion a year. That substantial sum must limit the extent to which we could go—in mandatory or discretionary regimes of approved pensions—substantially beyond what is already provided for. It is worth drawing attention to that figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tax law gives broad discretionary powers to the Inland Revenue relating to the approval of pension schemes. The tax approval rules have been adapted over the years to reflect changing patterns of pension provision. If they are now complicated, that is in part due to the willingness of the Revenue to adapt the basic rules to the needs of employers. In order that people know what is normally acceptable in the rules of a tax approved scheme, the Inland Revenue publish detailed guidance that explains, for example, that pensions may be broadly based on the best years' earnings in the previous five years before retirement or an average of any three or more consecutive years' earnings for a period ending up to 10 years before retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite changing patterns of work, those definitions of final remuneration meet almost all situations. The first option is normally favoured by most occupational pension schemes, because it suits people with normal work and earnings patterns. The second option can help those whose earnings tail off in the final years of their career. Taken together, the options available under the tax approval rules cover most circumstances and ensure that benefits can reasonably reflect earnings in the period up to retirement, and so provide an appropriate replacement income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) and for Milton Keynes, Southwest (Mr. Legg) mentioned a number of aspects to the tax rules that are of concern. I shall try to respond to their points. The position of people who suffer serious illness in mid-career is one that might give rise to such concerns. In such cases, and where a person can no longer continue his or her career, the scheme may allow early retirement. The pension may then be based on the normal definitions of final earnings that I have already described, and on the number of years service that the person could have completed up to the scheme's normal retirement age. In other words, benefits do not have to be limited to the period of employment up to the date of early retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now elaborate on that introduction. A person who has retired because of ill health may recover sufficiently to return to work. In such cases, it is normally a requirement that payment of the pension should be suspended if the person wishes to accrue further benefits
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0921">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>735</span>
under the pension scheme. When the person later retires at the normal scheme retirement age, the pension can be based on total service completed and the earnings at final retirement. However, if the person would be worse off on that basis, there is no obstacle to the scheme providing a pension equal to the earlier retirement pension that was given up, increased from the date of suspension to the final retirement in line with the retail prices index.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also considerable flexibility for those who change jobs. Most pension schemes give benefits that accrue at one sixtieth of final salary for each year of service, so that the maximum pension would be earned after 40 years. With such a scheme, when a person changes jobs the accrued pension can be based on the length of service completed and on earnings received at that time. On moving to a new job, someone can join that employer's pension scheme and the tax approval rules will allow benefits to accrue at a faster rate of up to one thirtieth of final salary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a very generous and, indeed, expensive level of benefits, which allows the two thirds of final salary pension to be earned after just 20 years service—half the normal time. The benefits, in keeping with the principle that the two thirds figure represents a reasonable benefit for a whole career, must then be adjusted to take account of pensions accrued under tax approval schemes of former employers, so that the total is kept within the two thirds limit. Given the costs of pension tax relief to which I have referred, that is not an unreasonable result. However, it is recognised that if a person suffers a reduction of income on moving to a later job, the pension could suffer. To overcome that difficulty, an occupational pension scheme can always give a pension of up to one sixtieth of final remuneration for each year of service, no matter how large the pensions from previous jobs might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding recognised, I cannot recommend acceptance of the new clause as drafted. As he rightly said, it contains technical flaws that would preclude it from having a meaningful effect. More seriously, it is possible that the definition would constrain the Revenue's discretion to use other definitions of final remuneration that might be more generous in many circumstances. Clearly, that would be undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given a brief description of what is possible under the tax approval rules for occupational pension schemes. It is, of course, for each employer to decide what benefits the scheme should provide, and how they should be calculated. Indeed, many pension schemes, for reasons of cost, provide benefits that are smaller than the tax rules would allow. Alternatively, there is nothing to stop an employer from being more generous. In such a situation, no special tax reliefs will be available, but that is not unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my explanation of the tax approval rules helps my hon. Friends. We do not claim that the present system is perfect, but from practical experience it appears to work well in almost all situations, and it allows people to accrue a good level of benefits with tax relief without getting in the way of employers who want to be more generous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Legg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>736</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am not anticipating my hon. Friend's intervention, but I want to mention personal pensions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Would the Minister address the Chair? He has a very attractive rear to his head, but I would be most grateful to see his mouth working.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Winterton, I apologise—no discourtesy intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West raised the idea of a level playing field between occupational and personal pensions. He said that taking out a personal pension would overcome the problem. Occupational and personal pension schemes have different tax rules. The former is limited by the benefits that it can pay while the later has limits on the contributions that can be paid in. Both types of schemes have their advantages and disadvantages, but taken overall each is capable of providing a similar level of benefits because of the flexibilities available under the tax rules for enhancing the accrual of pensions under occupational pension schemes or higher age-related contribution limits for personal pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those remarks satisfy my hon. Friends. I can only reiterate that, with the tax relief costing £7 billion, it is our broad intention to ensure that the two thirds of final salary over a whole career is not exceeded unfairly. Given that the rules provide for mandatory and many discretionary approved schemes, we have got the balance about right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. Both my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding and I—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding is clearly finding it difficult to hear because of the buzz of conversation in the Committee. I am similarly finding it difficult to hear what the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West is saying. Please could the Committee show courtesy to the speaker and to the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding and I are concerned in particular about an employee who has to change his job, for example if he has been made redundant. When he enters a new employer's scheme he will not be able to have earlier higher salaries taken into account when his final pensionable remuneration is calculated. However, if he remains with his existing employer and his salary falls off, he will be able to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I understand the point. The intention of the scheme and the law is that there should be a catch net so that people do not fall below the one sixtieth per annum provision. But equally, they should not be able, through a series of different jobs, to accrue, with the benefit of tax relief, entitlements to pensions at various stages based on accelerated contributions—that is, more than the one sixtieth provision. Some pension schemes can provide accelerated entitlement to two thirds of salary pension for someone who has not worked for 40 years, but half that time. For example—I hope that this is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0922">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>737</span>
relevant to my hon. Friend's point—if someone were to work 20 years for one firm and accrue two thirds of pension entitlement because of the accelerated scheme, move to another job where, with an accelerated pension entitlement, he could earn, with tax relief, a further two thirds of that salary, he would not be able to collect both sums on retirement and enjoy the benefit of full tax relief. That would obviously be unfair. However, there will be circumstances in which people have peaks of earning, not necessarily at the end of their career, but during it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why would it be unfair?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be unfair because the total of the two pension entitlements would exceed two thirds of one final salary. Consider the example of a person who worked 20 years on a constant salary of £90,000, with an accelerated accrued pension entitlement scheme. That person would be able to leave with a secured two-thirds entitlement of £60,000. If he switched to another job with an identical approved accelerated scheme, he would collect, on retirement, another £60,000 and receive a total pension of £120,000. Through those two accelerated schemes, he would gain more than the two thirds to which he would have been entitled, had he contributed on the one sixtieth approved basis throughout the whole of the scheme, working for one company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I take encouragement from my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To complete my point, there is a limit on the extent to which the Revenue can provide tax relief on contributions, even accelerated contributions. However, it is recognised that certain approved schemes must have accelerated contribution rates either because people are approaching retirement or because they are in a particular type of career in which they need to attract such contributions earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked about fairness because it is a novelty to hear Conservative Members putting arguments about fairness. Does the Minister's objection really relate more to the fact that the Treasury would be giving tax relief twice than to fairness?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The objection probably relates to both. It would be unfair to allow some people to organise their pension entitlement through approved schemes on changing job so that overall, with the benefit of tax relief, it exceeded two thirds of their salary over that period. That is not intended. Tax relief rules exist to provide people with a reasonable pension on retirement, earned over their lifetime. The flexibility provided in the discretionary rules under section 591 also takes into account that people have different peaks of earning at different times in their lives. A derivatives trader may be burnt out in his 30s, a North sea diver may be redundant in his 30s and a pilot in the armed forces may be redundant in his 40s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not make value judgments about people's activities, but it is recognised that different people have different peaks of activity and earning potential at different times in their careers. There is no intention to
	<span class='label label-info column'>738</span>
deprive people of their entitlements at the end of the day because they changed job or have an earlier peak earning power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West said, people can, on changing job, take out a personal pension. Contributions to such a scheme are limited. The final amount payable under such a scheme would not be restricted in the same way as entitlement under an occupational pension scheme, for the reasons that I gave, but the scheme input is limited to 17½ per cent., whether it is the employee or the employer who makes the contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to put the new clause to the Committee and to my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West for his support. With his characteristic lucidity and mastery of a complex brief, my hon. Friend the Minister of State almost succeeded in persuading me that my new clause was misconceived. However, despite his great charm and persuasiveness, I believe that I am the victim of that old-fashioned lawyers trick, the aunt Sally. Someone puts up an aunt Sally and then knocks it down believing that he has destroyed his opponent's case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Acceleration is not material to my case, which is simple. The present rules deny the full benefit of a pension to people who earned one in respect of a certain employment for no other reason than that they have earned a pension from a previous employment, which happened to be at a higher level of pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the example given by my hon. Friend the Minister of State, of a person who earned £100,000 a year during his good times. Suppose that no acceleration was involved. If that employee, and, of course, taxpayer—and subsequently pensioner—retired from his first job at the age of 50, he would not get two thirds of £100,000, namely £66,000, but whatever he was entitled to for the years that he worked. Suppose that sum is £50,000. That would be deferred until he was 60. However, he might take another job at the age of 50, which he did for 20 years, on a salary of £20,000 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On my hon. Friend's arithmetic—I was doing calculations while he was speaking—because of the one sixtieth rule, he would be entitled, in relation to his second job, to one sixtieth for each of the 20 years that he worked on £20,000, which comes to £6,000. Had he not had a previous record of employment but had done exactly the same job for 20 years, he would have been entitled to £10,000. The man in that example has therefore been deprived, of £4,000 for no reason other than that, at an earlier stage of his career, he earned at a higher level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alternatively, one could put the point the other way. He would be penalised for his decision to work in two jobs instead of one. That is unfair, and it is economically perverse. Something should be done about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to my hon. Friend, but I know that the Committee is anxious to make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will appreciate that the decision of the person to take a second job may not be his own. He may have been made redundant in his early 50s and sought alternative employment. In my hon. Friend's example, that would prejudice his entitlement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0923">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>739</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that good point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in something of a quandry. I am not persuaded that my case does not have merit. On the contrary, I am confirmed in the belief that it does. However, I have already acknowledged that my new clause is almost certainly technically defective, and I apologise to the Committee for that. It is also clear from the debate that we need to think more about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling)—to whom I do not often pay tribute—asked a pertinent question. We should know how much my proposed reform would cost the Inland Revenue. I recognise that it would be completely irresponsible to accept changes to tax law in Committee without being aware of the costs. I suspect that the cost of my proposed reform would not be enormous. However, that is a purely personal hunch, and I have obviously not been in a position to get a clearer assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not press my new clause to a vote but I hope that I will have an opportunity to discuss the matter in greater detail with my hon. Friend the Minister of State. I hope also to discover, perhaps through parliamentary questions, whether the costs of the proposed reform would be prohibitive, or whether we should move in a direction that the Committee generally acknowledges would be rational. As a result of that quantitive analysis, and whatever deliberations may take place in the meantime, it might be germane to bring forward a better-drafted amendment to next year's Finance Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to add a postscript that I hope will help my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding. The pension scheme of the final employer may pay benefit of up to one sixtieth of final salary for each year of service. If that is done, it is not necessary to take account of benefits from earlier employments. In that case, the person could have the full benefits accrued under the pension schemes of his past and present employers, even if that exceeded two thirds of the final salary scheme from the final employment. That option will help people with large pension entitlements from previous employments. It would be difficult to go further.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In light of your recent strict guidance, Mr. Winterton, this is an auspicious time to address the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As unpaid director of Job Ownership Ltd., I have a non-pecuniary interest to declare in this matter. New clause 17 is also in the name of the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) who, Mr. Winterton, may seek to catch your eye later in the discussion. I am also grateful to Field, Fisher, Waterhouse, the firm of lawyers that drafted the proposal. I realise, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding has done with his proposal, that the new clause could prove defective. We shall see about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw to the Committee's attention the fact that I am no stranger to the subject in the sense that I have espoused the cause of employee share ownership almost since becoming a Member of Parliament. When I examined the background in preparation for my remarks, I found that one element of new clause 17 appeared in new clause 25, which I moved on 19 June 1986 to that year's Bill. My involvement with the subject, therefore, goes back a little way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 17 and new clause 19—which is also in my name and that of the hon. Member for Rotherham—are designed to help sustain employee share ownership in this country in companies where it is already established. Those companies could be described as partnership companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ironically, once established, an employee share-owned company can encounter the problems of success. As share prices rise, for example, it can become harder for new employees to afford a similar size shareholding to those employee share owners involved in the original employee buy-out. It is important, therefore, that, through the mechanism of tax law, we aim to encourage not only the original establishment of employee share ownership but its continuation. That should be done within sensible limits. Both new clauses in my name are aimed at companies that are not less than 30 per cent. employee owned—in order to direct our attention towards all employee share schemes and not only a privileged few—and, where employee share ownership satisfies current statutory conditions relating to employee eligibility and share distribution. I have always been keen on schemes that are the sons and grandsons of the Finance Act 1978 not the Finance Act 1984. I say that for those in the Committee who have followed such matters over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am emboldened to move the new clause by the fact that I came across an excellent speech in my mail bag only yesterday that was made by a distinguished Member of Parliament whose name I shall retain for the moment, just to give members of the Committee an indication of the support that the proposal receives. That right hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Wider share ownership by employees has a vital role to play in business success. This is particularly so in the global market place of the 1990s, where a motivated and committed workforce is one of the determining factors in securing a competitive advantage. By actively engaging the enthusiasm and initiative of their employees, employers can help not only to secure their commitment to the business, but also to enhance their job satisfaction, and promote a greater sense of identity with the needs of the business. In short, effective employee involvement is directly linked to business success."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>742</span>
I very much agree with that, and, in moving new clause 17, to which I shall now turn, the Committee should bear in mind the wise words of my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 17 seeks specifically to encourage all employees, not just some, to borrow with the aid of tax relief to buy shares in the company for which they work and to do so at any time, not only within the first 12 months after the original employee buy-out. That would put employees of what I have described as partnership companies on a par with professionals, such as accountants, solicitors and others, who borrow with the benefit of tax relief in order to buy into their partnerships. I estimate that the cost would be minimal in the early stages because, as with all other previous tax law schemes to encourage employee ownership, it is likely to grow gradually and organically. Therefore, I do not envisage a large cost to the Exchequer in the initial stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to take a belt and braces approach, the new clause proposes that the amount of eligible borrowing should be limited to, for example, a sum equal to 50 per cent. of annual salary with a total cap of, perhaps, £30,000 in any year. So the provision could not be used infinitely; it would have to be used in a capped and controlled way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three key general points in favour of the new clause. The first is that it will facilitate the further broadening of individual ownership and contribute to solidarity in our society—a theme which should commend itself to Opposition Members. Secondly, it will help to create conditions in Britain's businesses in which all employees, whether managerial or shop-floor, feel that they are real stakeholders in the business, and thus enhance their commitment to the business and to corporate performance. Thirdly, the new clause will contribute to individual freedom and opportunity, thanks to the spread of personal wealth that employee share ownership, like any other form of share ownership, is likely to bring and, possibly, through the cascading of personal wealth down the generations, which, I believe, Conservative members of the Committee strongly support. With those general arguments in mind, and in the interests of brevity, I commend the new clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to make a short speech because, of course, one of the advantages of employee share ownership schemes is that one does not need long diatribes from either the top or the base because so many problems are resolved through partnership and dialogue. I am hopeful that the Financial Secretary will give some indication of the Government's view on the new clause, which is in a tradition of modest steps forward to promote employee share ownership. Such steps have been under way since 1978 when the then Chancellor, now Lord Healey, legislated for the first time in favour of an ESOP-type tax relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard many clause IV speeches today, notably from Conservative Members, so the new clause is a modest step in the direction of creating
	<br><blockquote><p>"a community in which wealth, power and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few."</p></blockquote>
It is a step forward in the direction of stakeholder capitalism, patient capitalism and partnership capitalism and in the direction of the management of companies based on solidarity rather than on the short term. It also draws examples from overseas, especially from the United States where some of the most successful companies in the manufacturing and the service sectors are ESOPs and, indeed, from Europe where, again, some of the most successful companies grant their employees
	<span class='label label-info column'>744</span>
the possibility of owning or buying shares. In Sweden, we have the example of Volvo. Sweden is a small country, but it still has its own car industry. We have not managed to keep a British-owned car industry under the present Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is a step forward which will consolidate many of the developments in favour of the market economy that have taken place in recent years, and which an incoming Labour Government would do so much to encourage and develop. I hope that in his reply the Finance Secretary will draw notice to its cross-party support. Before the hon. Member for Dover gets to his feet, I ought to declare an interest because I, too, am a director of the job ownership scheme, Job Ownership Ltd.—however, I am an unremunerated director with no share options at all. It is a modest new clause which will not cost the Treasury much and is part of an on-going process which cuts across parties and Chancellors. I hope that the Committee will support it and new clause 90.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that the Government will consider further all the matters relating to the development of employee share ownership plans and I look forward to hearing what my right hon. Friend has to say about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, shall be brief. Labour Members welcome the new clause. As the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington and my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham have said, wider share ownership among employees is to be encouraged. We favour giving people the opportunity to share in both the responsibilities and the rewards of ownership. We believe that that will be good for company performances and, for the sort of partnership economy that we are keen to create, which transcends some of the historical divisions and antagonisms between owners and work force. Such an economy appreciates the common interests of both and anything that enshrines that real interest by spreading the ownership of a company more widely is to be

welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in what the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington said about his preference for the 1978 scheme. That point is not lost on us. I think that there would be general agreement that that scheme did more—and did it better—than subsequent schemes to incorporate people's share ownership with the longer-term interests of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will echo the words quoted by his hon. Friend earlier about what a good thing share ownership among employees is. I hope that he will also tell us what estimates of the cost of share ownership have been given to him and what part of that might be a deadweight cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sir George Young)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I begin by explaining why I did not seek to reply to the debate when my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington sat down? My hon. Friend said that the hon. Member for Rotherham might reinforce what he said and I thought that I detected some movement from the other end of the Committee Room when my hon. Friend sat down. I wished to respond to the whole of the debate rather than having to speak twice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a tribute to the respect in which the Committee holds my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Mr. Conway) that without even hearing the Government's case, half the Committee followed him in voting against my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by paying tribute to the work of my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington in pioneering employee share ownership. The movement's good progress owes much to him and to the others who have championed the cause in Finance Bill proceedings. My understanding was greatly assisted by a meeting that I had a week ago with my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Rotherham, among others, at which I was given some of the background to the new clause. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for quoting a speech that I made recently. The speech went widely unnoticed, but it paid tribute to the concept of employee share ownership. The Committee has had several debates on that subject, and hon. Members appear generally agreed that employee involvement in a firm is a good thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been so polite to my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington that he will suspect—rightly—that I cannot advise the Committee to accept the new clause, for the following reasons. My hon. Friend will know that tax relief is available in certain circumstances to help people set up new businesses or to establish an employee buy-out. In such cases, the tax relief is fairly sharply focused on the circumstances of the establishment of a new business. There is a time limit within which qualifying loans must be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause goes further than that. It does not have a time limit, and it is not linked to the establishment of any new businesses. It is potentially expensive, as I shall explain in a moment, and also it basically subsidises the transfer of shares from one employee to another without being linked to the injection of new capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>746</span>
The Government's broad policy is to phase out individual tax reliefs. In fact, it is 12 years since we introduced a major new tax relief. The whole thrust of Government policy, as my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington will know, is not to promote tax breaks of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause could give rise to unintended cost effects, and the Exchequer costs could be high. If relief had been restricted to full-time employees, the cost probably would not exceed £10 million a year, but the new clause as drafted would make it possible for a person whose relationship with a company was relatively tenuous—for instance, he might work for it for only one day a year—to benefit from the access to the loan. A number of other technical reasons, about which I should be happy to write to my hon. Friend, reinforce the case for resisting the new clause, but the basic principle is that tax relief for individuals—which by and large the Government aim to phase out—must be sharply targeted. The new clause offers a rather widely focused relief and, despite the powerful case made by my hon. Friend I invite the Committee to resist it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad, Mr. Winterton, to have caught your eye again, and I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, although the generosity of his opening remarks made me suspect that he would not accept the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand my right hon. Friend's reasons for not recommending acceptance of the new clause. My right hon. Friend made special mention of the time limit and of the new clause's lack of an exclusive link to the formation of new companies. However, I stressed in my opening remarks that the main thrust of new clause 17 and the related new clause 19 was that, given that employee share ownership is established satisfactorily in this country, it should be sustained. Both new clauses were designed with that purpose in mind. That is why the organic link to the foundation of a new company and the lack of time limits formed part of my arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend made a more weighty point about the broad thrust of tax policy. He is right to say that I have always argued, both in Committee and on the Floor of the House, for a tax system with the fewest possible reliefs consistent with good order. Such a system would have the lowest possible rates and the broadest possible base. Since that is my view, I am rather hoist with my own petard. There are always good grounds for exceptions to a general position—such as with pension arrangements, for example—but my right hon. Friend has brought sufficient fire power to bear to cause me to beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion. However, I have had the opportunity to air the issue and to remind the Committee of the arguments which continue to attract all parties to the principles of employee share ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>'5A (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 4 and 5 above, this section shall apply to reduce the effective rate of capital gains tax on disposals made by individuals and by trustees.
	<ol>
	<li>This section shall apply where the person making the disposal has held the asset for a continuous period since acquisition of at least three years.</li>
	<li>When this section applies the effective rate of capital gains tax will be reduced as follows:</li>
	<ol>
	<li>if the asset being disposed of has been held for a continuous period of more than three years but less than four years the rate of capital gains tax shall be 80 per cent. of the effective rate;</li>
	<li>if the asset being disposed of has been held for a continuous period of more than four years but for less than five years the rate of capital gains tax shall be 70 per cent. of the effective rate;</li>
	<li>if the asset being disposed of has been held for a continuous period of more than five years but less than six years the rate of capital gains tax shall be 60 per cent. of the effective rate; and</li>
	<li>if the asset being disposed of has been held for a continuous period in excess of six years the rate of capital gains tax shall be 50 per cent. of the effective rate.</li>
</ol>
	<li>The effective rate of capital gains tax is the rate that would have been charged in respect of the chargeable gains arising on the relevant disposal as if this section was not in force.'.".—[	<i>Mr.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the hope of provoking some response from the Government, I thought it would be appropriate for us to
	<span class='label label-info column'>748</span>
debate the subject of capital gains tax in general and how it might be reformed. I want to probe their thinking on the subject. There is widespread agreement on both sides of the House that the present regime of capital gains tax is unsatisfactory. It has been widely criticised, including by the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, of which I am a member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is anomalous that someone who spends 10 years building up a company and then disposes of it is subject to the same marginal top rate of taxation as someone who makes an overnight gain on the currency markets. That is not a sensible way of conducting our tax affairs. To tax capital gains, which are often the product of many years of endeavour by entrepreneurs, at the highest marginal rate of personal income tax and at a rate that applies to someone who has made an overnight killing is patently absurd and almost nobody else would think of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system was introduced by my right hon. Friend the former Chancellor of the Exchequer some years ago substantially to eliminate abuse. There was certainly much abuse of the tax system at that time. The rate of taxation for capital gains was substantially lower than income tax rates, which were high. Many felt that they could, with the help of their sophisticated advisers, convert income into capital gains and reduce the tax payable. There was, therefore, clearly an advantage in equating the rates of personal taxation with those of capital gains tax. That was certainly true as far as the Revenue was concerned because it eliminated the incentive for tax avoidance schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, however, gone too far the other way. Given that people pay the same marginal rate of tax whether they leave their money in a company for several years or take it out immediately, there is an advantage in taking it out immediately. That has led to many of the phenomena that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have criticised. That is why people pay themselves excessive salaries, rather than leaving their money in the company; that is why excessive dividends are paid; that is why so many option schemes exist. At present, it pays to strip one's money out early—the opportunity cost of the money is not foregone and the effective rate of tax can be lower. We should not tolerate such a situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This country has a lower savings ratio than any of its major competitors except the United States, in part because of the capital taxation regime. That is a serious disadvantage. Although the savings ratio has improved in recent years, it is still lower than that in Japan, Germany, France, and Italy and that cannot be allowed to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must, therefore, devise a system of taxation for capital gains that gives people an incentive to leave their money in businesses and help them to grow. As many hon. members have said, most growth in companies comes from retained profits, but there is no incentive to retain profits as long as the fruits of such a course of action are taxed at the top marginal rate of taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not pretend that the proposals in new clause 18 are the only way to solve that problem. They represent one way, however. Nor do I suggest that we should abolish capital gains tax altogether. Although that would undoubtedly have economic advantages, many people would again seek to exploit the system by converting income into capital gains, which would be undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0928">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>749</span>
Instead, we need a system that taxes capital gains, but rewards people for leaving their money in the company. Under the new clause, people would have to leave their money in a company for a minimum of three years to get any reduction in the 40 per cent. rate that they currently pay. If they did that, they would receive a reduction of 5 per cent. for every year thereafter that they left their money in the company or the investment, and the rate of taxation would fall, therefore, to a mimum of 20 per cent. after six years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That combines all the advantages we need. It means that the gain is deferred sufficiently to prevent people from converting immediate current income into a capital gain. It means that there is a reward for leaving one's money in over the long term, and it also means that some tax will eventually be payable, even if the money is left in for more than six years.

I believe that something along those lines would greatly encourage further investment and would discourage all the unpleasant features that have been criticised by so many members of the Committee, especially the very high dividends, which are an unsatisfactory phenomenon in the British economy. I therefore hope that the Government will respond positively, at least to the spirit of the new clause. I look forward to hearing then-response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support my hon. Friend's new clause. He has advanced some strong arguments in favour of reform of the capital gains tax system. The current system is not working overall. We have a plethora of reliefs, a very complicated system and, at the end of the day, very little revenue is collected. Last year we collected a yield of only £710 million from capital gains tax. The Red Book shows that estimates of the yield for the current year are of a similar order, as they are for next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, therefore, running a system of taxation that raises very little revenue and has a high administration charge. The Inland Revenue annual report shows that the administration costs of running the capital gains tax system run at about £42 million a year, which is some 6 per cent, of the yield. There are further, hidden, costs of administering the present complex system within the private sector. Very few taxpayers—or tax advisers—can understand the complexity of current legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a plethora of reliefs—retirement relief, indexation, rebasing and roll-over relief. The Bill includes extra shelters such as venture capital trusts, personal equity plans, which provide a shelter for quoted investments, and enterprise investment schemes. The current numerous shelters, therefore, are for both quoted and unquoted shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington has made a welcome step towards significant tax reform. He began by referring to some of our competititors who have higher savings rations; they included Germany, France and Japan. All those countries have a capital gains tax system that distinguishes between short-term and long-term gains and the desire to do that here is at the heart of the new clause. If we had a system that made that sort of distinction, this country would enjoy a better attitude towards the accumulation of capital
	<span class='label label-info column'>750</span>
and investment and, as my hon. Friend said, there would then be a bias away from consumption. He was right to claim that there is currently no incentive for people to leave their money in companies. The incentive is to take it out in high salaries and there is thus a bias in favour of consumption. The new clause, or one similar to it, would go a long way towards redressing the imbalance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Personally, I should like the new clause to go further. I should like the rate of capital gains tax to be reduced to zero. If after, say, five years, people have invested on a genuine long-term basis, especially in unquoted companies, they should have the benefit of relief from capital gains tax. With regard to venture capital trusts, the Bill would provide total tax relief after five years, as happened last year for enterprise investment schemes. Going a little further would be even more beneficial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to the matter of turning income into capital. The capacity to do that exists mainly in unquoted companies where directors are actively involved in running the company. Many of our reforms in the capital gains sphere are intended to provide incentives for people to invest in such unquoted companies on a tax-free basis. So there is a contradiction in our capital gains strategy. A thorough-going reform, which my hon. Friend's new clause would produce, would be most beneficial in the creation and accumulation of capital in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly because I know that the Committee wishes to move on. My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West has raised an important issue. It is clear that capital gains tax is the most economically damaging of all taxes. All taxes, of course, are economically damaging to a certain extent. Capital gains tax is the most damaging because it is a tax on risk-taking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to add to what my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West said. If we went down the route that my hon. Friend suggested—of abolishing capital gains tax on all long-term capital gains—it would be a wonderful tax simplification, which would help people honestly to fill in their tax returns. How on earth my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Treasury Bench believe that little old ladies in my constituency can cope with the weighting of securities when there is a part disposal of a line of stock bought at different points and different prices in the past, I simply do not know. How in the world they think that those old ladies can cope with indexation of capital gains under present arrangements, I really do not know. It is wrong and dangerous for this House to connive in fiction—that a taxpayer is capable without professional advice, often disproportionate in price compared with a capital gain of more than £5,000 a year, to understand the tax rules and to make an honest return. I do not believe that that is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West suggests reducing the prospective rate of capital gains after six years by 50 per cent. That would certainly reduce the economic damage, though it would not deal with the problem that I just raised. However, it might be especially attractive to my right hon. and hon. Friends in the Treasury who are rightly trying to maximise Government revenues as its impact on public revenues might be positive. Those who are currently not crystallising capital gains because they do not wish to pay capital gains tax at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0929">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>751</span>
40 per cent. might be tempted to do so when capital gains accrued over more than six years would be taxed only at half that rate. The Government might find themselves with a windfall revenue gain. I hope that Ministers will take that into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend hit upon a very important point—the economic distortion that a high rate of capital gains imposes. It prevents people from making investments which they would otherwise make. Is my hon. Friend aware that when capital gains tax was cut in the United States, the yield rose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not know that but I am grateful to my hon. Friend for the confirmation of the supposition that I made in my remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my three hon. Friends the members for Stamford and Spalding, for Milton Keynes, South-West and for Carshalton and Wallington for introducing such an important debate about capital gains tax and its implications for the working of the economy. I agree with many of the points made in our debate—for example, the need to promote a strategic long-term look at the requirements of the economy and the need to ensure that small businesses have access to funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would make a major change to our capital gains tax system through the introduction of tapering. I should like my hon. Friends to reflect on a number of issues before they decide whether to press the new clause. First, a cost is associated with the measure. We estimate that the cost would rise to £400 million, a substantial sum. We need to consider carefully whether we want to promote a measure that would potentially increase the public sector borrowing requirement by that sort of figure in the years ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with some of the other points raised. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West referred to the cost of collection. The cost yield ratio is 4 per cent. and, hopefully, as the yield increases the percentage figure will decrease. The figures have been relatively lower than they might otherwise have been in the past few years because of the point we had reached in the economic cycle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the cost, I invite my hon. Friends to reflect on two other points—first, whether a tapering measure is actually appropriate; and secondly, if the case were made for changes and the resources were available, whether tapering is the right method. On the question of whether tapering is appropriate, we must consider the matter from the point of view of the ability of a taxpayer to pay a bill. Whether the gain is short term or long-term, the resources available to the taxpayer and his capacity to contribute are the same. From the point of view of equity and ability to pay, whether the gain is short or long term is not relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must also take account of the fact that many investors do not pay capital gains tax—for example, institutions and overseas investors do not. In fact, only 100,000 people pay capital gains tax, so the impact of the changes on the investment strategy of the country as a whole would be relatively small.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>752</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend confirm that the majority of those who pay capital gains tax are the proprietors of small businesses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rather than give an off-the-cuff reply, I should prefer to give a more authoritative answer after examining the sources of those who pay capital gains tax. I emphasise that only a small minority of the total tax-paying population—100,000 people—pay capital gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to draw the Committee's attention to the complexity of the new clause and contrast that with the plea for simplicity that has been a major theme of our debates during the past two months. To introduce a system of percentages that bite in after a given number of years would be complex and it might not fit in easily with self-assessment. If the case were made for lightening the regime, would not there be better ways of doing that—for example, looking at the indexation, the exemption or, indeed, the rate as a whole—than introducing a tapering system?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned other countries. They may have lower rates or a different rate for long-term gains, but they tend not to have indexation or exemption, which we have. When those factors are put into the equation, they bring the headline rate of 40 per cent. down to an effective rate of closer to 25 per cent. It is indeed the case that a number of shelters exist. In defence of the present regime, I would argue that we have finely targeted exemptions—roll-over relief and retirement relief—which may be a better way of promoting economic policy than simply reducing the rate for long-term gains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we cannot discard the argument that a lower rate for long-term gains creates a locking-in effect. People would hang on to underperforming assets in order to reach a more gentle fiscal regime, whereas the economy might be best served by their transferring their investment into higher-performing assets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend accept that a 40 per cent. tax liability pregnant in an asset is a disincentive for the investor to move out of that asset and to put his cash into an asset that would provide a better rate of return for the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes—unless that investor was able to benefit from the roll-over relief. If my hon. Friend wants to deploy that argument, he must also concede the force of mine, namely, that a decreasing series of rates is an incentive to the investor to hang in there until he reaches the gentler fiscal regime. One of the consequences of moving from the present system to a tapering system would be to aggravate the locking-in effect, which encourages an investor to hang on to an asset in order to shelter the gain and pay less tax, which may not be best for the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friends to reflect on the cost—£400 million—on the complexity and on my arguments. I suggest that the new clause should not be pressed further at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his courteous and considered response. However, I am disappointed that he did not give a commitment that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0930">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>753</span>
Treasury will look in some detail at the possibility of reforming the tax. I had hoped that, at the very least, he would admit that the present situation was unsatisfactory and required further consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, in the normal pre-Budget considerations it will be open to my hon. Friend—or, indeed, anyone—to come up with fresh proposals for capital gains tax, which we would consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for that limited assurance, although he did not go quite as far as some of my hon. Friends and I might have hoped. I accept that the principal disadvantage of my new clause is that it does nothing to simplify the present situation and in some ways it makes it more complex, but I am not convinced by many of the other arguments put forward by my right hon. Friend in defence of the present system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On costs, I accept that if we took the simplistic view that there would be a total negation of a proportion of the gains arising out of the reduction in tax rates, it might be possible to make a theoretical calculation to show that it would cost £400 million. I do not believe that any such figures would be arrived at in practice. As my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West has said, experience in the United States has shown quite the reverse—the yield on capital gains tax has increased substantially as a result of a reduction in the rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor do I entirely accept that the very high rate which we have in this country—higher than that in any other major western country—is sufficiently offset by the indexation allowance. None of us would want to tax purely inflationary or paper gains—it is quite right that we tax only real gains—but the rates in other countries are very different. In France the rate can, admittedly, go up to 19.4 per cent., but in many cases an investment is entirely exempt. In Germany, if shares are held for less than six months and then paid in full, income tax rates apply—but, with only one or two exceptions, for shares held for over six months no tax at all is paid. In the Netherlands the rate is also nil. In Italy, the rate is 25 per cent., but there are several exemptions. Only in the United States do the levels that my right hon. Friend was talking about apply. The maximum there is 28 per cent., but in many cases the rate is less than that because such gains ar taxed at the marginal rate of the taxpayer and the marginal tax rates in the United States are generally low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are still uniquely highly taxed on capital gains in this country by any method of reckoning. There is an urgent case for changes in the regime for the benefit of the British economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend and I am listening carefully to his very powerful arguments. Is not one of the most telling points—which he has made by implication—that the tax catches only 100,000 taxpayers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. Those 100,000 taxpayers tend to be the entrepreneurs in our society. They pay tax on the fruits of their labours and they, uniquely, have very little means of avoiding that tax. It is the small business men who are most affected. Large business men—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One way in which entrepreneurs can avoid such tax is to leave the country, because we have a
	<span class='label label-info column'>754</span>
uniquely high rate of capital gains tax. Does my hon. Friend agree that if we reduced the rates of corporation tax, more entrepreneurs would be likely to stay in the United Kingdom, thereby increasing revenue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. It is a fact that a high proportion of successful entrepreneurs—faced with very high levels of capital gains tax if they have built up an extremely successful company—leave the country for several years and become non-resident for tax purposes to avoid paying the tax, with a considerable loss to the United Kingdom. Not only would we lose the tax on the capital gain but we would lose the benefit of their continued presence in the United Kingdom and their stimulus to our economy. It is mainly small entrepreneurs—people running small businesses—whose gain is not sufficiently large to warrant leaving the country for several years and who do not have the sophisticated advice that is available to some large entrepreneurs who end up paying the tax. That is why the numbers are small and I shall be interested to hear what my hon. Friend says about who those people are, according to Treasury records.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for reform is undeniable. It is made by all the leaders of business opinion in this country. The Confederation of British Industry wants reform; the Institute of Directors wants reform; chartered accountants want reform; the Law Society wants reform. Almost everyone in this area believes that reform is long overdue and I hope that the Government will reconsider the position and bring forward their own proposals in the near future. In the meantime, I accept that the new clause may not be satisfactory, but I hope that the debate has been interesting. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I can be even more brief than when I was discussing new clause 17 and I hope that the tall hon. Member across the way—the hon. Member for Romerham—will catch your eye, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the new clause, which is disarmingly entitled, "Employee share ownership", is to deal with problems that can arise with employee share ownership trusts. The present position is that shares in an employee share ownership trust must be distributed within 20 years. The new clause would enable a proportion of the shares in a partnership company, such as that to which I referred in relation to new clause 17, to be indefinitely retained in a statutory employee share ownership trust. The balance of the shares would men be distributed to all employees as required under current legislation. Partnership companies such as the Baxi Partnership or Tullis Russell, the papermaker in Scotland, which want to retain some shares indefinitely in their employee share ownership trusts as a way of sustaining partnership characteristics, could do so free from the complexities which would otherwise be associated with the current legal position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman proposes to allow a trust to hold 30 per cent. of the ordinary shares, whereas at present a trust can hold 15 per cent. Will he explain why he chose 30 per cent. instead of 50 or 25 per cent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite simply, 30 per cent. constitutes a substantial employee shareholding and would enable the trust to act as guardian for employee share interests in the company in question. It is thought to be a reasonable figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a company wishes to do that, it must set up, in addition to an employee share ownership trust, a general employee benefit trust. That necessarily leads to some duplication and extra costs. It also unnecessarily complicates the employee ownership structure of a company such as Tullis Russell and brings benefits only to lawyers, accountants and other professional advisers. Although I advise the Institute of Chartered Accountants, as you know, Mr. Winterton, I believe that public interest clearly lies with this small blow for clarity and simplicity in tax law as it affects employee share ownership and I commend the new clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington is now proposing that a share ownership plan should have an on-going existence—should exist in perpetuity. The construction of the new clause and the way in which it interacts with existing legislation mean that it would be possible for the ESOP, once it had acquired a 30 per cent. stake in its founding company, to hold 99 per cent., which it could hang on to indefinitely. That conflicts with the original conceptions of ESOPs which were that they should be a vehicle for the relatively speedy transfer of shares from the trust to the employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend came to see me, he said that it would be helpful to have a trust that could make a market in the shares. There are other ways of achieving that objective—by writing the articles of association to oblige employees, when they want to sell their shares, to offer them initially to the trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can we get one point absolutely clear? Are the Government opposing the idea of employee share ownership trusts which would be a new form of ownership within our market economy? I am in favour of them, even though they are only a modest step in the right direction. I want to get it absolutely clear—perhaps for future reference—whether the Government do not like employee" share ownership trusts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We like ESOTs and believe that their objective is to pass the shares through to the employees. That is why they were originally conceived. If the hon. Gentleman reads last year's debate, he will see that the promoters of employee share ownerships were clear that they should not have an on-going existence, which would be created by the new clause. There is a risk that an ESOT would be able to hold on to 99 per cent. of the shares for ever instead of passing them through to the employees. That philosophy inspired my hon. Friends when they pushed the initial legislation through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many disadvantages if the trust exists for ever and hangs on to a large number of shares. In the United States, such schemes can be used to thwart takeovers, which was not the original objective. Although I understand the reasons for the new clause, it goes beyond the initial reasons for employee share ownership. For that reason, I advise the Committee not to vote for the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the Financial Secretary replied. I want to make only a brief contribution, although I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for reminding me about the hon. Member for Esher. I was wondering where he was. I understand that he has been promoted to better things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
ESOTs are to be encouraged and promoted. My concern about what the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington is promoting is the same as the Government's concern. If the trust can hold up to 30 per cent., which is, as the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington said, a substantial holding, it changes the nature of what I understand a trust to be, which is a holding operation while the shares are transferred to employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in what the hon. Gentleman said about genuine partnership. The partnership that we want to encourage is that between employees who ultimately hold the shares and the company, rather than that between the company, the trust and, I suppose, some of the employees. It is not clear why we should increase the amount that trusts can hold to 30 per cent. I was not convinced by the hon. Gentleman's argument. The important thing is to get the shares into the hands of employees, because one would then have a genuine partnership. We want to encourage that useful form of ownership. We seem to be creating a tripartite relationship between employees, the trust and shareholders. I am not sure that that is desirable. The hon. Gentleman may persuade us when he sums up, but we are not persuaded at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that three points of importance have been made in this mini-debate. I should like to say how those points relate to the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary is absolutely right to say that the proposal represents a change of emphasis when it is compared with the proposal that was advanced successfully by my hon. Friend the Member for Esher last year. However, as my right hon. Friend will appreciate, many different kinds of employee share ownership are legally possible. Some of them are more attractive than others to people in the corporate sector in the United Kingdom. One of the more paternalistic forms of employee share ownership, which tends to rely more on the trust than on individual ownership, has its own legitimacy, and needs a shout from time to time. I am trying to give it a shout in my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, my right hon. Friend quoted an example that I shall call a limiting case—Ministers are wont to do that. He said that if the new clause found its way on to the statute book, a trust might hold on to 99 per cent. of stock indefinitely. Of course, pigs could fly and all sorts of other weird and wonderful things might happen. However, in the real world, I am reliably informed by people who are keen on employee share ownership and who want to sustain it. As I said earlier, a 30 per cent. holding, which is mentioned in my new clause, would be perfectly adequate. The proposal might be a bit paternalistic, but it would ensure that employee share ownership is sustained, and that what is interesting about it is not lost sight of among other market developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to my third point. It was suggested, I think by my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, and by others, that perhaps the proposal could be used as a
	<span class='label label-info column'>758</span>
method to prevent takeovers—particularly contested takeovers. I must put my hand up and say, "Yes, that is correct." There will be times when it is in the interest of employees and of companies, especially those that are successful, to resist a takeover that may not be conducive to a firm's local or employee interest. That point commends itself to small firms in outlying parts of the United Kingdom, such as Tullis Russell, which is represented principally in Scotland, as Opposition Members will know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existence of an employee share ownership trust, with its own substantial holding, can ensure that a more balanced view is taken of an outside bid if and when one is made. That is not to say that the bid will not succeed; it means that the interest of employees, shareholders and customers will receive equal representation in the consideration that is given to any bid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Across the water in North America, the idea of employee share ownership first arose in the Polaroid Corporation, where it was a poisoned pill, as they say in the United States, to prevent a hostile takeover that was not in the interests of the company or of that sector of the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my three points will convince my right hon. Friend—if not this year then in future years—that there is a case for arguing that employee share ownership should not be subjected to one template or to only one approach. There are many forms, all of which are valid and legitimate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The story that I want to tell shows how the tax system is inadequate in terms of helping businesses to invest and allowing relief for capital allowances. Lengthy appeal procedures incur high costs which, in the case of my constituent's company, have extended to £200,000 and may grow much larger. The Inland Revenue and the Government are having to incur substantial appeal costs. There have been delays within the Inland Revenue because the matter that I raised last year has still not been dealt with. The perverse effect is that a win in the special commissioners' court by my constituent's company has not produced the logical outcome of—as one expects from established procedure—the law being returned to what it then was. It is perverse that my right hon. Friend the then Financial Secretary, who replied to the debate last year, and the Inland Revenue, it its press releases have said on various occasions that they never intended a change in the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year the Committee was told that clarification was needed on capital allowances because people were able to claim them on buildings by claiming them to be plant and machinery. There was some doubt about the dividing line between buildings and plant and machinery. My constituent won a case at the special commissioners' court that his investment in car washes was plant and machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government said that it was not intended to change the law, but to clarify it as it then was. In so doing, the Government ignored a decision of the special commissioners and sought to change the law. That happened last year. The purpose of my proposals was to avoid there being a change in the law and to establish the position so that my constituent is not legislated against retrospectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>760</span>
I point out to my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary that the new clauses will not benefit my constituent's company in any way if they are passed today unless the High Court holds the appeal to be just and valid. It must support the special commissioners' decision. I am not proposing to change the law as of 30 November. However, if the High Court confirms the special commissioners' decision to put the law back to what it was on 30 November, the legal position should remain as it was before the Budget and before last year's Finance Act. Certainly, that is what Ministers have said in statements and what my right hon. Friend, now the Secretary of State for National Heritage, said last year. That is also the situation according to last year's Inland Revenue press release. The then Financial Secretary said that the new rules were not intended to change the treatment of assets that qualify as plant at present as a result of court rulings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, there was a court ruling, in so far as the special commissioners are a court. I would be interested, as, no doubt, would the hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon), who raised the point last year, to know whether the Financial Secretary regards the special commissioners as a court for this purpose. Are they a court that determines and supports the law? Do they interpret the law, as the Minister said last year? If they do determine the law, and the Minister said last year that it was not the Government's intention to change the law, surely the clauses should be accepted by the Government today and incorporated in the Finance Bill, which would only ensure that there was no retrospective legislation last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background is that my constituent's company has been very successful during the past 20 years in developing car washes in the United Kingdom. The company currently employs 400 people, many of whom are young people and people in their first jobs. Many of them are taken off unemployment registers. It is a good way of giving employment to people who might not otherwise have jobs. The business now has 135 branches from Inverness to Eastleigh and, in 1994, 6 million cars were washed and the company had a turnover of £9.5 million—.just the sort of enterprise that I thought the Government wanted to encourage. It is a growing and successful business, which is clearly in demand from consumers, and it is environmentally friendly because the water is recycled. One of the reasons why the water is recycled is because there is heavy investment in plant and machinery in the installation of the equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It costs £150,000 to set up the car washes, which involve extensive engineering work. I consider it grossly unfair that the capital allowances system does not recognise the fact that such a large investment is required in what is essentially plant and machinery. A considerable amount of time has been wasted because the case has not progressed at all since I raised the matter in Committee last year. Much paperwork has been exchanged. I have two pages detailing letters exchanged between the Inland Revenue and my constituent's company's solicitors. Letters have gone backwards and forwards. I shall give the Committee a small sample of the correspondence. On 19 April, the company's solicitors sent letters to the Inland Revenue's solicitors' office suggesting agreements on nil assessments for 1986 and 1990 as the basis on which the matter could proceed. By 13 June, no reply had been received to the letters of 19 April. The solicitors,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0934">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>761</span>
Denton Hall, chased up by telephone replies to letters of 1 June, 26 May and 19 April. They had received no replies by 13 June.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 13 June—I believe at midnight—a letter from the solicitors' office of the Inland Revenue was faxed to Denton Hall, which contained acceptance of an agreement on nil assessment. The significance of that is that, for two months, my constituent's company's solicitors tried to get the case progressed so that the affair could be moved forward. Nothing happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Jumping forward a little to July, we find that Denton Hall were again chasing the Inland Revenue solicitors office for responses to letters sent in the middle of June. A letter was sent on 12 July that referred to a letter of 16 June to which there had been no reply. A copy of that earlier letter was also sent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In late July-early August, we finally received some agreement from the Inland Revenue solicitor's office. The matter had dragged on through May, June and July, but my constituent was finally able, by October, to have a case put together by the special commissioners so that the matter could be taken to the High Court. However, when the final version of the case was stated on 10 January by the special commissioners, we discovered that the Inland Revenue had been in no hurry to seek a decision from the High Court. My constituent's company is the respondent in the action, and the Inland Revenue is the appellant, but that company has had to press the High Court for the case to be brought forward. A year has passed and the case has not reached the High Court. The uncertainty and delay have cost the taxpayer a lot of money and had a detrimental effect on my constituents' company. He wants only to run his business, invest in it and help the country's economy and employment position by expanding opportunities in the car wash sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As members of the Committee are not able to help with delays in dealing with the correspondence of my hon. Friend's constituent, does not my hon. Friend agree that it would be a good idea to refer the case to the Revenue adjudicator, Mrs. Filkin?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point. The way in which the matter has been handled may need to be reviewed, but I wanted to make it clear that such problems can become ludicrous and unjust. That would not have been the case had last year's Finance Bill made it clear that the Government would accept the role of the special commissioners, with the result that the law would have been in place by 30 November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not act retrospectively. We should accept that the special commissioners have made a reasonable decision in this case, and we should encourage capital allowances to be allowed in such circumstances. They are commonly allowed in the rest of Europe, and United Kingdom businesses are therefore in an uncompetitive position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Binder Hamlyn in Germany advised my constituent that a similar investment by a company audited in Germany involved in conveyor car washes could be depreciated "with full tax effect". It has also been confirmed that tax allowances in that sector are permitted
	<span class='label label-info column'>762</span>
in Germany, France, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain and Portugal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only an appeal to the High Court by the Inland Revenue is preventing a similar permission from being implemented in this country. That appeal is of questionable merit, given that the special commissioners' case is well argued and well understood. Why should British business be at a disadvantage relative to businesses in Germany, France, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain and Portugal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The special commissioners' decision was very clear, and I draw the attention of members of the Committee to column 615 of 	<i>Hansard</i> last year. I also referred to Lord Justice Templeman's decision in a case at column 615. That decision was quite clear: items such as these should be regarded as plant and machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clauses 20 and 21 accept the law as determined by the special commissioners. I hope that the High Court will confirm that position and will throw out this ludicrous appeal. The Government should also accept that position when the law is confirmed, and I hope, therefore, that members of the Committee will agree that justice demands that they support the new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Hogg, your predecessor, Mr. Winterton, invited us to accelerate, although accelerating in a car wash is dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) has championed his constituent's cause with vigour and determination for a second time in our deliberations. His comments deserve a serious reply. The key issue is that the Inland Revenue has never accepted that the buildings and the tarmac area are machinery or plant and they are, therefore, not eligible for capital allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is to go before the High Court. Changing the law concerning a case that is currently before the courts could be problematic. If we change the law, as my hon. Friend proposes, we might extend plant allowances to assets—which the Government do not accept are or ever have been plant—in advance of a court ruling to the contrary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best way forward is to say that the Government will carefully consider the implications of the court's decision and to invite my hon. Friend to withdraw his new clauses in the meantime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make two points, however. First, tax commissioners cannot make law by precedent; the only bodies that can make law are the courts—that is their prerogative. Schedule AA1 last year cannot have changed the law simply because it was contrary to a tribunal's decision. It would be perverse to do as my hon. Friend wants and suggest that the commissioners can make law. It has been known for two sets of commissioners to reach different decisions in virtually identical cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 21 would make the law contradictory and uncertain, and I cannot believe that that is what my hon. Friend wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, if the special commissioners had made their decision, and the Revenue did not appeal, the Revenue would be saying that that was the law. The fact that the Revenue has appealed, however, means that it perhaps wants to query whether the commissioners' decision was right in law. If the Revenue loses that appeal in the High Court, the special commissioners' decision
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0935">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>763</span>
will have been confirmed and they will appear to have got the law right. As of 30 November, therefore, the law should not be changed if the Inland Revenue press release and the Minister's statements last year are to be supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The key point is that the special commissioners are not the courts. The press release on Budget day referred specifically to court decisions. Tribunal decisions do not set legal precedents. Two outcomes are possible in the scenario before us: one is that the courts find in favour of the Revenue. If that happens, accepting the new clause would substantially weaken the existing boundary between plant, and buildings and structures. If the final court decision favours my hon. Friend's constituent, the law will have been changed by the Finance Act 1994. I repeat what my right hon. Friend said last year: we will consider the issue again when the appeal is finally decided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To accept the new clause now would, as I said, substantially extend the boundary of entitlement to allowances. There may be precedents in Europe, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dover mentioned, but the new clause would represent a very substantial weakening of the stance that the Inland Revenue has always adopted and it would have cost implications. The best advice that I can give to my hon. Friend is to invite him not to press—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary tell us what the cost implications are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The cost implications could be substantial. Buildings that qualify for 4 per cent. allowances would qualify for the allowances of plant and machinery. I will endeavour to get a direct answer to the hon. Lady's specific point, but the new clause covers not only my hon. Friend the Member for Dover's car wash, but all similar products. That is why one must consider the broader implications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point about cost is that it effects any decision that had been decided by the special commissioners but had not been decided in a Court of Appeal. Have I in my constituency probably the only case in the whole country that had actually been decided in a company's favour by the special commissioners but had not been decided by the Court of Appeal? There cannot be that many cases that the Revenue has taken to appeal. In effect, we are making law that might affect one specific case in the whole country, which happens to be that of my constituent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the question that I was asked about new clause 20 is: costs not known, but could be substantial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend the Member for Dover examines the new clause, he will see that it inserts in the Capital Allowances Act 1990
	<br><blockquote><p>"expenditure on the provision of a conveyor car wash including surrounding surface area integrated into the design of such conveyor car wash".</p></blockquote>
That would extend allowances to cases where they are not currently eligible. The Revenue's attitude is that the car
	<span class='label label-info column'>764</span>
wash is not plant and machinery, but a building, and, therefore, the regime is different. There are cost implications of conceding the principle in new clause 20.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to summarise the situation, as I understand it. Is the Financial Secretary saying that if the taxpayer is ultimately vindicated in court, establishing a legal precedent, last year's Finance Act changed the law to the detriment of the taxpayer? If it did, what action do the Government intend to take to put matters back to how they would have been had the courts been able to decide the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That question was posed to my right hon. Friend last year and I answered it a few moments ago when I said that I would consider the issue when the appeal was finally decided. That is the best way to proceed. My hon. Friend the Member for Dover wants us to prejudge the outcome of that decision in a way that would substantially extend allowances to an area which has not previously been allowed. I think that that would be wrong. The right tiling is to invite my hon. Friend to with draw the new clauses and to reconsider the matter when the High Court has decided. If it decides in favour of the Revenue, the position is relatively straightforward: we did not change the law last year. If the court finds in favour of my hon. Friend's constituent, the Government would have to reconsider the matter in that light.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is very convincing and has almost convinced me, but not quite. I accept that there might be a problem with new clause 20 because it might open up other possible claims—although I would suggest that the cost effect of new clause 20 would be very small, but, possibly, greater than one small claim before the courts—but I question why I should withdraw new clause 21. New clause 21 simply states that if a case was ruled on by the special commissioners and the Revenue accepted that ruling and did not appeal, the law should be as it was at that time. If the Revenue appealed against the ruling, the Government would not have to worry about looking at it again; they could accept the decision when the appeal was determined and that would become the law. Surely, new clause 21 should be acceptable on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me try again on new clause 21. Its impact goes way beyond car washes. It gives the force of legal precedent to commissioners' decisions. Does my hon. Friend intend that? Any tribunal decision made before 30 November 1993 that an asset was plant, would have to stand if there was no appeal or if the court subsequently upheld the decision. Hundreds of tribunals throughout the country make thousands of decisions annually. The Government could not possible know what items might fall to be considered as plant if the new clause became law. The cost to the Exchequer in lost tax could be enormous. It is not unknown for two commissioners to reach different decisions in virtually identical cases. The clause would make the law contradictory and uncertain. I cannot believe that my hon. Friend wishes to secure that objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>767</span>
regards his own new clause as much the most important—his little pet hobby-horse. However, the advantage of mine is that it raises a matter that has been referred to throughout our proceedings. I therefore need not detain the Committee long; there have been continual obiter dicta on the subject in our debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is the second largest Finance Bill ever, following a Budget that most people said was a little short on content. Last year's Bill was the largest Bill—it was so big that it could not be stapled together and had to be published in two volumes. There are two factors: the Bill's sheer length and its complexity. Other hon. Members have complained, quite rightly, about the complexity of the legislation, the fact that it continually refers back to previous legislation and the difficulty of following its meaning—I think that the time has come to address that issue, with which I have been concerned for many years. I know that my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary agrees because he said so the other day when he was speaking to an Institute of Taxation conference. There is no disagreement about that, but a consensus that something needs to be done—the only question is what.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled a new clause proposing the introduction of a tax law commission, but it was not called because it would involve public spending. The new clause proposes that the Inland Revenue should review the matter, consider all the arguments and determine the best way forward. I am not entirely happy with having the Inland Revenue do that because I regard that organisation as part of the problem—although I hope that it will be part of the solution. The solution needs an independent element, however, so that whatever emerges from our proceedings, the people who have to use the legislation will also be involved in the review process and in agreeing the solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, as a chartered accountant, also support my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). I have not worked on the tax practice side of accountancy—I tend to be on the audit side—but I have always marvelled at the way in which lawyers and accountants manage to spend enormous periods of time poring over intricate legislation, innumerable Bills and Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One problem is that the outside world perceives tax legislation in terms of loose-leaf binders—if there is a change, they take out the old page and put in the new page. We, as my hon. Friend said, legislate around stapled-up, bound Bills. Until we tackle that issue—of not bringing in massive amounts of new pages every year, but replacing existing pages—we shall never have the luxury of being able to debate existing law in Committee by having it readily to hand. The same problem occurs outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fervently hope that my hon. Friend's new clause will receive serious consideration. One solution, albeit rather simplistic, would be for Parliament to consider passing a Bill into law consolidating all tax legislation, keeping it in loose-leaf form and amending the legislation only by replacing sheets. Then we would have a full understanding of the law in relation to specific clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to comment on new clause 26, which stands in my name. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>768</span>
agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield on the need to introduce elements of simplicity into the complexity before us. No one would claim that our deliberations are riveting listening for people wandering into the Room by mistake. Despite my misgivings about the adequacy of our adversarial procedures for dealing with complex technicalities, at least primary legislation receives some scrutiny, however technical and complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, regulations emanating from the legislation that we pass do not receive a satisfactory degree of scrutiny. Indeed, if they are debated at all, it may be on the Floor of the House where, even if technical inadequacies are exposed, there is no opportunity to amend them. At the end of the debate, it is a question of voting for or against the motion. I am not sure that that is a helpful way to deal with such inadequacies. We can all get advice from professional bodies; we can all try to adopt that advice; and we can all bring it into the debate and put forward our case on the regulations. But there is a better way, so I hope that the Minister will give it serious consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute of Taxation made a useful suggestion. Just as the Government have set up the Social Security Advisory Committee because they believed that advice on technicalities would be helpful, so a similar advisory committee to consider regulations emanating from various Taxes Acts would be helpful to all Members of Parliament, not least to Government Members. It would enable technicalities to be examined for possible flaws and passed to Ministers for proper consideration before regulations are brought to the House. The new clause would, as I say, benefit the Government. It might ensure that mistakes are not made, making it unnecessary to return the following year to introduce further legislation to correct avoidable mistakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary may say that there would be problems in putting all regulations through that procedure; he may say that there might be occasions when obvious loopholes are seen by the Government or when unintended hardships are caused and there is, therefore, a need to legislate quickly. That may be the case, but I am sure that exemptions could be built into the process to deal with such circumstances. Exemptions could be built in for a regulation that involved a simple change of rate; my suggested process would not then have to be gone through for such simple matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would, however, suggest that the proposal is interesting and worthy of consideration. It would help the legislative process in an area where there is not proper scrutiny. If the Government are interested in taking correct decisions openly, with maximum advice from all hon. Members, they will accept the new clause. If, however, they are intent on secrecy, hiding away decision making and not allowing full advice to be available to all hon. Members, perhaps they will reject it. I hope that they will accept the new clause or at least, if the wording of the new clause is unacceptable, give a clear indication that they have a similar alternative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much as I agree and sympathise with the intentions of both new clauses, I believe that they are unnecessary.

	<span class='label label-info column'>769</span>
My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary and, indeed, our right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor both have the power to short circuit the whole process and to move rapidly, perhaps in next year's Finance Bill, towards what I believe is described as purposive legislation—if I have the correct adjective—in contrast to the current legislation, which takes the belt and braces approach to every conceivable tax avoidance and other eventuality. That view has been held for a long time by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which, as the Committee knows, I advise. That profession would, I think, regard such a change sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a brief contribution to the debate. The new clause of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield seems to have much merit. If he were to press the matter, who knows, he might win the support not only of Opposition Members but of one or two of his colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to support the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts). It would set up the equivalent of the Social Security Advisory Committee with regard to tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has often been pointed out, tax law is becoming very complicated and, in some areas, provides unnecessary complication. As the hon. Member for Dover said, that means that while lawyers and accountants might have a field day, taxpayers find it difficult to thread their way through the various pieces of legislation. The point would have particular importance if self-assessment were to proceed further; the taxpayer is entitled to know where exactly he or she stands before the law. Much tax law is not politically controversial, but it is the subject of party-political controversy. It would, therefore, do no harm to provide an opportunity to consult and to review the way in which the law is framed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, East (Mr. Brown) used to make the point that half the Finance Bill could almost be included in a technical Bill which could be examined by a Committee. I do not know whom he would volunteer to serve on such a Committee, which might be less than exciting, but a number of our hon. Friends might thrive on such activities, thus leaving the exciting political stuff to another Finance Bill Committee. I am not sure, however, that that is the correct way to proceed. Things that may be dull and not immediately exciting on first examination may in fact be quite controversial. Given the fact that most of us have no specialist technical expertise, to consult, where that is possible, and to receive outside advice as to impact might be greatly beneficial in the long run, not only to the House but to taxpayers and to the general body politic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will concede the point that was made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. It has the advantage, to both Front Benches at least, that it would incur minimal expenditure and it can therefore be welcomed. The proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe seems to have substantial merit and ought to be accepted by the Committee. Both new clauses, then, are worthy of support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no difficulty with the principles behind both new clauses. The plea for simplification from my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and the plea for consultation from the hon. Member for Attercliffe were noted. However, I have
	<span class='label label-info column'>770</span>
reservations about the need to enshrine in legislation that both hon. Members want to be shorter, these two extra clauses which enjoin us to do just that. I hope that I shall be able to explain that what the Government are doing meets the objectives of both new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield made a clear short speech and hoped that legislation might follow his example. I agree with him, and I have much sympathy with the new clause. Coming relatively lately to the field of tax, I have been struck by the complexity of the legislation and have been lost in admiration for those members of the Committee who seem not only to understand but to enjoy it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause focuses on legislative simplification, but, as my hon. Friend knows, there are other ways in which the Government can make life simpler for the taxpayer—for example, by taking people out of tax, by introducing deregulatory measures to reduce the burden on business or by simplifying the system. Already, some 5.4 million taxpayers pay tax at a rate of only 20 per cent. We have made it clear that, as improvements in the economy allow, we shall continue to look for ways in which to reduce the burden on individuals by taking more people out of tax altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deregulation has a role to play, and the Bill contains some deregulatory measures. Self-assessment should simplify the system for a large number of taxpayers by removing the rigmarole of estimated assessments and appeals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the thrust of my hon. Friend's speech, which is the problem of the legislation itself. One new proposal, which might help in future, is to be more flexible in the way in which legislation is drafted. As a means of piloting one possible approach, we are now giving serious thought to contracting out to the private sector the drafting of some parts of next year's Finance Bill. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) has recently tabled a number of questions asking how that exercise will be conducted and I shall make a detailed statement in a written answer shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a growing feeling throughout much of the developed world that much more needs to be done on the language of tax law. Both Australia and New Zealand have recently launched major exercises to rewrite their entire tax codes in a more user-friendly format. The objective is to minimise a range of costs, both public and private, associated with tax legislation which is both complex and difficult to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since becoming Financial Secretary I have become conscious of how strongly many tax professionals feel that the United Kingdom should move in the same direction. Reflecting that concern about our tax regulation, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has recently formed a tax law review committee with a wealth of experience, expertise and talent. The Committee's stated objective is to keep under review the state and operation of tax law in the United Kingdom. One of the projects that it has recently put in hand is to rewrite part of the tax code in a shorter, simpler, more user-friendly form. It will also be specifically examining the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington about the whole question of purposive legislation. The special committee of the tax law consultative bodies has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0939">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>771</span>
embarked on a project similar to the one that I have just described, which is to rewrite the tax code in a simpler form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am following the work of the TLRC and of the special committee with interest, and I am happy to say that the Inland Revenue is giving their work its full, active and enthusiastic support. The timetable for the work means that, by the end of the year, we shall only just be starting to see the first fruits of much of the work that is now under way. Given the importance and wide-ranging nature of the issue, we must be sure that we have all the information before making any decisions on the potential for making progress on an extensive simplification of tax legislation. For that reason, I do not want to be bound either to the timetable or to the format suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield in his new clause. As I hope I have made clear, I support my hon. Friend's underlying objectives but do not want us to be constrained in our means of achieving them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn finally to new clause 26. The argument is that we should replicate the SSAC with a comparable body to examine tax law, but the hon. Member for Attercliffe is not suggesting such a wide-ranging role for his proposed tax Acts advisory committee. Given the diversity of the direct taxpaying population, I am sure that that is right. The key point is that the Inland Revenue already consults widely on secondary legislation, because each set of regulations tends to have a well-defined set of interested parties. Recent examples include regulations relating to the tax rules on foreign exchange gains and losses and the consultation on the construction industry tax deduction scheme. Both are specific examples of the Inland Revenue consulting directly with the interested parties. Large chunks of the Finance Bill were published in draft and made available for comment at the same time as the relevant primary legislation was published in draft or appeared in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both on simplification and on consultation, there is no serious disagreement in the Committee on the need to seize opportunities with both hands, but I do not want to add complexity to the legislation by incorporating the new clauses, or to be constrained in the precise way suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that what I have said will give some confidence to those who have moved the new clauses and convince them that they need not press them. The Government are determined to make progress on the arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that we are not embarking on an exercise similar to that being conducted in Australia and New Zealand. They are getting on with the matter and the time has come for us to do the same. I am sorry that my right hon. Friend cannot accept that. The Inland Revenue is obsessed with the possibility of losing control. It is a rare Government Department in which the same people are in charge of policy and the execution of policy. There are virtually no tax policy people in the Treasury—they are all in the Revenue, and they also have the responsibility for collecting tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation is unhealthy and I am not sure that farming it all out to the private sector will help. As Ian Barlow, head of UK tax at KPMG wrote in 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> yesterday
	<span class='label label-info column'>772</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"My suspicion is that the problem may actually be more to do with the complexity of those instructions than the skills of the draftsmen.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>There appears to be a determination to load every new piece of legislation with widely drawn, complicated provisions designed to prevent what the Revenue and Customs and Excise perceive as avoidance."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington asked why we could not have purposive legislation. We will have to move towards that, otherwise we will be overwhelmed by the volume and complexity of legislation in years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
