	<p>	<i>Question proposed [this day],</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Mr. Legg) was on his feet when we adjourned for lunch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Legg 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Milton Keynes, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we broke for lunch, I was explaining that the clause makes the Inland Revenue responsible for making wholly judgmental decisions about the appropriate financing of substantial companies that have been established in the United Kingdom by overseas investors. My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary made much of the arm's length principle. We are handing over all judgments on the arm's length principle to the Inland Revenue. Even if one has complete knowledge of a company, it remains a question of judgment what level of finance one believes would be provided at arm's length by a third party. As anyone in the corporate sector knows, if one shows various financiers and bankers a balance sheet, one receives completely different answers as to how much any financier or banker will lend to a company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, members of the Committee may be aware that, recently, Pentos allowed its subsidiary, Athena, to go to the wall. It was surprising that a public company allowed its subsidiary to do that. It does not often happen because it is usual for public companies to stand behind their subsidiaries. That is another factor that will be taken into account when the Inland Revenue, looking at groups of companies and subsidiaries, form a judgment on how much finance they may obtain. It will ask whether the parent company will stand behind its subsidiary and what the attitude of that public company's directors will be. There is a range of uncertainties and the Inland Revenue will be in the driving seat deciding what capital structure is acceptable for overseas investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies), who referred to the insertion of section 808A into the legislation, especially when much of it is effectively spent. That is a good point because it adds to the uncertainty surrounding the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was also good enough to refer to amendment No. 190, which I tabled, and which was not selected for consideration by the Committee. It set out safe harbour provisions, with which some members of the Committee may not be familiar. Basically, safe harbour
	<span class='label label-info column'>396</span>
provisions set down firm guidelines for overseas investors so that they know how much debt they can put into an overseas operation in the United Kingdom and receive tax relief on the interest. Many countries provide such safe harbours, which are an added attraction to external investors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Hoon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ashfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would those overseas companies be able to put aside any more debt than the amount that they invested in the United Kingdom in the first place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is basically my argument. There should be certain defined levels of debt which can be put into UK companies, but companies should be able to put further debt if they so wish—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because that is a commercial decision. If companies put in higher levels of debt, they would be able to agree with the Inland Revenue whether the interest on that extra debt should be treated as a tax deduction. A number of countries operate safe harbour provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is talking to the clause stand part and not seeking to speak to an amendment which was not selected and which therefore does not form part of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite right, Mr. Winterton. I am speaking to the clause stand part. Unfortunately, the clause does not deal with safe harbour provisions. This is a deficiency in the clause. Japanese legislation provides for safe harbour provisions, as does that in many of our continental partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overseas investors often choose whether to invest in Germany, Spain, France or the United Kingdom. Both of the countries in the examples that I have given have safe harbour provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have another question which follows from the hon. Gentleman's answer to my earlier question. If the hon. Gentleman accepts the idea that a foreign company should be able to offset more debt than its expenditure in the United Kingdom by way of safe harbour provisions, is not he really saying that the British taxpayer should be subsidising overseas companies to set up operations in the United Kingdom? In that case, is not he a late convert to the idea of the state supporting such industries to locate in the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon) has misunderstood my point. Safe harbour provisions would provide guidance to outside investors. If they wished to exceed those provisions, they would have to justify the matter to the Inland Revenue, and prove that they were doing so on an arm's length basis and that the level of debt was the same as that which a domiciled company could achieve. If they could not agree with the Inland Revenue on a level of debt or if they went above the level that the Inland Revenue had decided on the arm's length basis, that interest deduction would be disallowed and it would be treated as a distribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several of our competitors on the continent have such provisions. Germany is a particularly interesting example
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0730">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>397</span>
because, in the case of holding companies, the safe harbour provision runs up to a nine to one basis. That means that a holding company set up in Germany can have nine times more debt than it has share capital. That relates to the point made this morning by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) about tax allowances and balance in the economy. The possibility of such high levels of debt and interest charges in Germany does much to mitigate the high levels of corporation tax that apply there. The Government would do well to consider the safe harbour basis, because it provides a degree of certainty to outside investors. Most of us know from our dealings with Japanese or German investors that they appreciate such certainty and a system that is rule based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will be interested to hear what my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary has to say and whether he can give us any details of what informal guidance ratios the Inland Revenue may use. Some tax practitioners believe that the Revenue works on an informal one-to-one basis. I do not know whether my right hon. Friend can confirm that or if he feels that some different informal level would be appropriate in the future. If the Inland Revenue is working informally on a one-to-one basis, it is in marked contrast to the acceptable debt levels among some of continental competitors to which I referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Stamford and Spalding and for Beaconsfield raised interesting points about consultation this morning. I am sure that the Minister will tell us whether consultation took place. I am unsure whether it did; if it did, it certainly seems to have been inadequate, judging from the representations received by many members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise only briefly to add to the remarks made by my hon. Friends the Members for Milton Keynes, South-West, for Beaconsfield and for Stamford and Spalding. In particular, I support my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding in his extremely robust remarks about the inadequacy of the parliamentary drafting. As a long-standing campaigner for simplicity in financial legislation, I hope that my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will be able to reassure us that never again will any Finance Bill Committee have to deal with provisions that are so opaque. I echo the criticisms made by my hon. Friends who have already spoken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that I heard the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) make a noteworthy remark. He appeared to suggest that a future Labour Government would contemplate using such provisions to impose swingeing tax increases. The hon. Gentleman's speech—like many of his speeches—will be worthy of the close attention of those involved in the industry in general, and in taxation advice and accountancy in particular.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alastair Darling 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if the hon. Gentleman would quote the words I used that could possibly be interpreted as he seeks to do—the exact words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, I cannot do so. However, I am happy to accept the hon. Gentleman's challenge, and I shall answer that challenge on Thursday, when the 	<i>Hansard</i> for today's proceedings has been produced. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>398</span>
listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's speech and I look forward to being able to quote his exact words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seemed to me that, yet again, we had weasel words from the hon. Gentleman. His words will be subjected to close analysis by those involved in taxation advice, because they need to be aware of the great risks in store for those who want sensible investment in British industry, especially from companies seeking to make inward investment. It was that section of the hon. Gentleman's remarks on which I concentrated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman think that any strength in what he says is undermined by his inability to back up his remarks. By making wild allegations that he hopes he might be able to substantiate in future, he makes a nonsense of everything he says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have responded to the hon. Gentleman's challenge by saying that I will quote him, chapter and verse, as soon as I have the copy of 	<i>Hansard</i> in front of me. It is difficult to answer him now, because one cannot take a contemporaneous note of everything the hon. Gentleman says. Even he will accept that, like many lawyers—I am one myself—he tends to speak rapidly, and it is difficult to take a contemporaneous note. In the section of the hon. Gentleman's speech dealing with inward investment, he made it absolutely clear that he foresaw that there would be scope for attacking foreign companies' investment in tins country. I look forward to being able to answer his challenge in detail on Thursday morning, when I will have the copy of 	<i>Hansard</i> before me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sir George Young)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Minister of State this morning, the Committee might like to know that my hon. Friend has arranged for copies of the press release referred to in the debate on the establishment of a gilt repo market to be made available to members of the Committee. They can be collected from the Clerk's Table.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 75, as you may have noticed from today's debate, Mr. Winterton, will not win the clause of the year prize for clarity of purpose and tidiness of construction. I should like to deal with the four issues that have been raised in this interesting clause stand part debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West, from whom, having repositioned myself, I now operate at arm's length, asked whether we should have the policy of certainty—the safe harbour policy—or the current policy of flexibility. That theme ran through our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second theme concerned whether the clause has to be as complex as it is. The third concerned whether the Inland Revenue was being as helpful as it might be and whether guidance would be published on the rules. There was also a general point about consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worthwhile putting once more on the record that, of all the companies that invest in the UK, we reckon that fewer than 500 will be affected by the clause. That puts things in perspective. The vast majority of companies that invest in the UK do so under rules that are wholly unaffected by the clause's provisions, and those companies are happy with those rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0731">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>399</span>
A point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West that was reinforced by several other members of the Committee concerned whether we should operate a safe harbour policy, which would provide certainty. My hon. Friend said that if clear rules were published about the relationship of debt to equity, potential inward investors would know where they stood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That proposal presents difficulties: however the ratio is fixed, there is a risk that it will either do injustice to taxpayers by being too generous to the inward investor or do an injustice to the inward investor. Our flexible system is preferable because it examines the relationship between the two companies and comes up with the right formula. As my hon. Friend conceded, even countries that have chosen the safe harbour formula have had to top it up with alternative arrangements. The arm's length relationship is understood, is included in most of our double taxation agreements and has not deterred the massive inward investment into the UK over the past few years. Given the choice between safe harbour and flexibility, I prefer flexibility. It is interesting to note that the Law Society, which has provided helpful briefing to the Committee, also wants to preserve the current approach, with detailed negotiations with the Inland Revenue, as opposed to the safe harbour guidelines suggested by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend for giving way to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman was the only member of the Committee on his feet and the Minister gave way. That is why I identified him and called on him to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful, Mr. Winterton. There was one point that I made this morning that the Minister did not say that he would deal with in his remarks, but that was particularly relevant to the issue with which he is now grappling. I am talking about the issue of predetermination. Will my right hon. Friend assure the Committee that, in future, potential investors in the United Kingdom who are concerned—as they all will be—about the application of the clause's provisions, can apply to the Revenue for a predetermination of their case so that, before they take an investment decision, they are certain that the financial structure that they propose for their UK subsidiary will be acceptable to the Revenue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I outlined the four issues that I plan to address, the third involved whether the Revenue was being as helpful as it might be. I shall deal with that point in due course. I give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West, to whom I thought that I had given way last time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way. I think that he may have lost sight of one of the main points in my speech—that there can be no right debt equity ratio. The idea that the Inland Revenue will be able to find the right debt equity ratio for every company that puts in an application to it is fallacious. I am concerned that such a matter will be left to the judgment of the Inland Revenue and that, in many cases, it will inevitably get that judgment wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Inland Revenue has to operate within the framework of the clause's provisions. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
clause sets out the criteria to follow when coming to a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system that my hon. Friend criticises has been operating for some time and many companies are happy with it. They prefer that system to his alternative, which is much more rigid and precludes the opportunity of negotiation between the Inland Revenue and a potential company, which is a flexibility that they very much welcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The system that I advocate does not preclude flexibility. Having set debt equity ratios, I still allowed for my provision to go beyond those ratios should that be justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But my hon. Friend begins to demolish his case, which was based on certainty not flexibility. However, he now says that certainty needs the addition of some flexibility because his system cannot be constructed with inflexible rules. Our system has that flexibility, it is familiar and it has worked quite well. I do not agree that there is a case to abandon that system for one which we have not tested, which is not in our double taxation agreements and which has not precluded the successful attraction of inward investment from countries such as America, which are happy to operate the existing system. If my hon. Friend wants to persist with his argument for a safe harbour, he is free to do so. I have, however, examined that in some detail and have consulted with those who operate the system. I am supported by the Law Society, which also prefers our system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me move on quickly to the matter of complexity. One of the themes running through the debate was that people wanted to know where they stood. One reason why the clause is so long is to try to give that certainty. For example, the hon. member for Edinburgh, Central asked what was a relevant connection. It is defined in (8C)(a) and (b). We tried, within the framework that I have described, to give an element of certainty. We wanted to reassure investors that the approach to the arm's length test contained in the clause constitutes no change from the approach that previously applied for most investors. Taxpayers and their advisers are familiar with section 808A which is why that section is incorporated in the clause. Some of the complexities will give investors certainty about how the arm's length test will apply in cases where the United Kingdom company has relationships with other companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We went round the course with all the representative bodies mentioned earlier in the debate. Having listened to the points made and having discussed them with the draftsmen, we concluded that it was not possible to simplify the clause without jeopardising some of the objectives outlined. The complexity is with us. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield was speaking in jest when he suggested that it might be best to withdraw the clause. That would merely inject uncertainty where it is not needed. I hope that on reflection he will agree that that is not the best way to proceed if we want to continue to attract inward investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A serious point emerged about whether the Inland Revenue is being as helpful as it should be in giving people predeterminations—advance notice—of their tax position. A number of hon. Members asked whether we plan to issue guidance. My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding asked whether the Inland Revenue
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0732">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>401</span>
was prepared to rule in advance that the particular financing arrangements envisaged by a multinational company planning to invest in the United Kingdom are unlikely to fall foul of the arm's length principle enshrined in the clause. I am pleased to tell him that for many years investors have been able to approach the Inland Revenue and obtain such guidance based on the precise facts of the case and intentions of the parties. As I said in our earlier debate, Revenue officials are already assisting taxpayers by determining how their financial arrangements sit in relation to the clause. I must tell the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central, that the Inland Revenue intends to publicise its understanding of how the provision will operate in its tax bulletin publications in due course. I hope that that will also give potential inward investors a greater certainty about the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A broader debate exists, which my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding has invited me to embark on, about pre-transaction rulings and post-transaction rulings, not related to this clause but across the tax regime generally. We are making progress with pre-transaction rulings—we are piloting them in certain parts of the country. We are also making progress with post-transaction rulings, precisely for the reason given by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding, to try to inject an element of certainty into the tax regime by enabling people to contact the Inland Revenue, explain what they want to do and obtain an answer on the tax consequences of their planned actions. I attach great importance to the Inland Revenue being as helpful as it can to potential investors by giving them the knowledge necessary to decide that the United Kingdom is the country in which to invest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the matter of consultation, I should make it clear that other countries have not consulted us when they have changed their thin capitalisation rules. As there is an element of eliminating tax avoidance, we did not consult in advance. As I said before, however, we have discussed the drafting of the clause with a range of representative bodies and taxpayers, including all those mentioned by hon. Members earlier. Having gone through that with them in detail, we concluded that one could not restructure, simplify or shorten the clause without forgoing some of the advantages and objectives that I have just mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt with the main themes that have emerged in this most constructive debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the issue of consultation, do the remarks of the Financial Secretary show that the comments of the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding—who made calumnious charges in alleging that there had been inadequate consultation—were correct, and that there was inadequate consultation? Why could not the principles of the legislation be a matter of consultation with inward investors without involving the risk of avoidance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principles are already well established. We are extending the principles that applied to 99.5 per cent. of inward investment to the 0.5 per cent. that was not covered, because of the complex interaction of our tax law with the double tax agreements with the countries in question. We are extending a principle that is well established, and about which we have consulted
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
endlessly—for instance, in the context of double taxation agreements—to the 12 countries where inward investment, if it were structured in a certain way, could result in a tax loss to the United Kingdom. I am not sure with whom we should have consulted without giving, in effect, advance notice to potential investors that if they were quick, they could restructure their inward investment so as to gain a tax benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much revenue does the Financial Secretary think the Revenue would lose if the clause were not enacted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to estimate the revenue in a moment. First, I should put right what I said to may hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding about pre-transaction and post-transaction rulings. Post-transaction rulings are being piloted in various parts of the country, and we hope to make progress with pre-transaction rulings later in the year. Inadvertently, I put it the other way round.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary for saying that the Government are moving ahead with pre-transaction rulings. He will agree that those rulings are essential in investment decisions to eliminate uncertainty. It is most lamentable that the Revenue has not been able to provide the service that the Internal Revenue Service has provided in exactly comparable circumstances to potential investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Revenue had consulted with the businesses that are targeted by the clause—namely, major investors from the 12 countries—why should tax avoidance have been the result, as my right hon. Friend just suggested? The companies might just as well restructure their United Kingdom subsidiaries in order to meet the clause's requirements in advance. Surely, the whole object of the operation is to get such businesses to change their financial structures. It seems a little perverse to give that as the reason for not consulting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will understand that if one consults on anti-avoidance measures, there is a risk of alerting companies, and of generating a campaign to stop the loophole from being closed. When one considers protecting the tax base, it is not conventional to consult in advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Legg</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the issue of tax evasion, we are discussing not loopholes but companies structuring their balance sheets in a way that is acceptable to the Inland Revenue. Overseas companies that invest in this country want to structure their balance sheets so that they obtain tax relief. There is no benefit in incurring too much debt and having interest disallowed. Consultation about that matter is beneficial to this country, as the recipient of the investment, and to the overseas company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I agree with my hon. Friend. Thin capitalisation is all about tax avoidance. All countries have introduced rules to deal with thin capitalisation to protect their tax base. I do not accept the premise from which my hon. Friend started.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting my right hon. Friend again. I am becoming more, not less,

concerned about consultation. We had understood that the Government had decided that the Revenue, as a matter of course, would consult before making significant changes to the Taxes Act 1988. Now we are told that it will not do so if the changes cover actual or potential avoidance, but most changes to the 1988 Act cover some form of actual or potential avoidance. On what principle will the Revenue consult in future and on what principle can we expect consultation to take place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principle has to be that, where it makes sense, there will be consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I think that I have carried the Committee with me on that first premise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be circumstances in which the Revenue does not want to consult or cannot consult. In such circumstances there will be no consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to the that when unintelligible gobbledegook, which will act as a barrier to inward investment, is stuck before the people, that is when the Government do not want to consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will not overseas investors draw a clear conclusion from the fact that the Labour party consulted them when the Government chose not to? Is the Minister now in a position to tell us the cost of not accepting the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman reminds me of the question. The answer is that the cost is not easily calculated, because it depends on behavioural effects. I hope that he agrees that that was worth waiting for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a useful and wide-ranging debate and the time may have come for the Committee to decide whether the clause should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make two comments. First, the Government have set out their principles on consultation, which was extremely useful. We shall bear that in mind, as well as the assertion that the cost is not easily ascertained. Having told us that it was an anti-avoidance measure and that the cost could not be easily ascertained rather undermines that assertion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree with what the Government are trying to achieve, but we are concerned that the measure will discourage inward investment. This country needs inward investment, contrary to what the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Hawkins) tried to impute to my earlier comments. Regrettably, I cannot be in the Committee on Thursday morning because I shall be addressing the National Association of Pension Funds in Eastbourne, but I shall look forward to reading the hon. Gentleman's grovelling apology on a point of order first thing on Thursday morning, should he catch your eye, Mr. Winterton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The few minutes since our earlier exchange has given me the opportunity to look back at my notes and I can help the hon. Gentleman with the section of his speech that I was attacking. It was the section in which he tried to suggest that changes in taxation policy would not cause any diminution in the amount of inward
	<span class='label label-info column'>404</span>
investment. Had I had the opportunity to intervene then, I would have pointed out that under the previous Labour Government, because of their taxation strategy, there was a substantial lack of inward investment and a brain drain. That is what the hon. Gentleman was suggesting to me and, I suspect, to others who read the proceedings of this Committee, would happen again under a future Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised that the hon. Gentleman had to give up the law and come here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It strikes me—I dare say that it has struck the majority of members of the Committee—that the clause is not well drafted. The Minister said that it is not exactly clause of the year, which is an understatement. It is badly drafted and we should not pass into law measures that do not lend themselves to ready interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of progress, we should leave the matter there, but we will test whether Conservative Members who spoke so vociferously and with such feeling were doing so from genuine feeling or were expressing hot air.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Government amendment No. 223.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will know of my longstanding interest in the world of higher education. I was briefly a Minister responsible for that area of education policy. Since then, in my period on the Back Benches, I have been an adviser to De Montfort university in Leicester. The Committee should bear in mind those two facts when listening to what I have to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am naturally sympathetic to the case put by the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals. I believe that all members of the Committee received the briefing from the CVCP in advance of today's debate, and that will inform, to a considerable extent, what I have to say in support of the amendment in my name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure, Mr. Winterton, that in Macclesfield, as in Carshalton, qualifying index securities are not on everyone's lips in the Dog and Duck on a Friday evening, but they are an important financial instrument to the world of higher education. It is clear that clause 77 would unintentionally catch those universities which quite properly and legally have used those schemes to improve their financial position, especially on the capital expenditure side. The Committee may be interested to know that more than a dozen higher education institutions have issued QISs with a total value so far of £300 million. These are relatively early days, but those instruments are proving to be a cost-effective and sensible way of funding and financing some much needed capital expenditure in a higher education system where the number of students has grown by nearly a half since the beginning of this Government's time in office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The higher education institutions have sought to use QIS's to secure a stable form of long-term finance for essential capital projects at the best available rates of interest. That has been done most notably for new student
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
housing, although the activity has not been confined to that. The use of the instrument is especially important as universities are not able to use public funds for such purposes. The private sector has been brought in to take some of the strain of what has been a rapid expansion of capital expenditure by many of those institutions. For example, De Montfort university—which I have mentioned already—has expanded very rapidly in recent years. It was a polytechnic before the binary division was abandoned, and now has about 26,000 students, which shows how big some of the institutions have become.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The universities have also been encouraged to explore what the Chancellor calls his private finance initiative as a means of raising money for necessary capital expenditure in the higher education sector. As many as 18 interested universities have been co-operating recently with financial institutions in work towards the issue of a new universities' bond for such purposes. They had hoped that the idea would come to fruition soon, because it appears to be an effective and promising way forward that will enable more private finance to be drawn into the capital side of higher education. Not only have a significant number of institutions become involved, but members of the Committee will have received many of the same letters that I have received from institutions as diverse as the London School of Economics, King's College, London, the University of Portsmouth and the University of Aberdeen, to name just a few. All those institutions support the spirit and purpose of my amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, the amendment would exempt universities from the effects of the clause. That is necessary because they belong to a special category, as they have charitable status as autonomous and largely non-profit-making institutions. Also, it would prevent unintended conflict with the private finance initiative, which Conservative Members support strongly and want to be taken further. That is a worthwhile aspect of Treasury policy, but it appears to be cut across by some elements of the clause. The amendment would also retain the exemption for the longer-term insurance business. As my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary will have noticed, we do not seek to delete that subsection of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before preparing my notes, I had hoped that my right hon. Friend would have felt able to accept the amendment without demur, but he has recently tabled his own amendment, Government amendment No. 223, which is being taken with this batch of amendments. I shall say a word or two about that amendment because it constitutes the Government's rather inadequate response to the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend will correct the if I am wrong, but Government amendment No. 223 offers an alleviation for higher education institutions until 1 April 1996, giving them a temporary breathing space before the main provisions of the clause take full effect for universities and other bodies that use QIS's financial instruments. According to the universities, that is not as good a concession as that which Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals and the institutions would have wished for. In the spirit of charity—and he knows that I am a charitable man—I welcome the measure as a small step in the right direction; however, it does not go far enough for those in higher education and does not meet the needs of the hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0735">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>407</span>
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend should reconsider the case for the longer-term exclusion of higher education institutions from this aspect of the tax regime. He should do that if he really cares—as I am sure he does—about the capital expenditure needs of those institutions and if he really wants the private finance initiative to succeed not only in the transport sector, where it has had some early success, but also in higher education, health and the other parts of the public sector in which Ministers have sought to apply it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This change in the rules that affect private finance for higher education, which is implicit in the rather small concessions that my right hon. Friend has seen fit to make in Government Amendment No. 223, will not do enough to enable higher education institutions or the financial institutions with which they co-operate to meet the pressing need to move ahead quickly with the capital building programmes of those rapidly expanding institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who follow such matters, such as the hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith), might say that higher education institutions are not expanding as rapidly as they were some years ago, and I must concede that that is true. They have entered a period of consolidation. None the less, if they are to cope with the human consequences of the rapid expansion that has taken place in the past five or 10 years, it will be necessary after an appropriate time lag—and these matters always involve leads and lags—to continue with those capital projects. Were clause 77 to be agreed to as originally drafted or with the my right hon. Friend's minor amendment, it would not adequately meet the needs of the higher education sector at this sensitive time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I hope that my right hon. Friend will accept at least the spirit, if not the letter of amendment No. 178. To do otherwise would send a negative signal to the universities and to the financial institutions with which they co-operate so positively on private sector initiatives. It is in the national interest that those building programmes go ahead, not least because it can save the taxpayer a great deal of money if the private sector takes the strain. I hope that those few words will persuade at least some members of the Committee of the strength of the case being put forward by the higher education institutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman) has demonstrated both the feeling and experience with which he speaks on such mattters. He referred to his time as a Minister responsible for higher education. I had the pleasure of shadowing him in that capacity and while we did not always agree on aspects of Government policy, I can certainly attest to his dedication to the interests of the higher education sector. I hope that Conservative Members will listen carefully to the powerful case that he has set out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly would not suggest that we do not need the amendment and do not need to exempt higher education institutions from the provisions of the clause on the grounds that the need for additional accommodation has somehow flattened out. I know from my constituency—as will other hon. Members with higher education institutions in their area—that such has been the increase in student numbers, such is the pressure on the local
	<span class='label label-info column'>408</span>
housing market that that has brought about and such is the inadequacy of the accommodation which many students are presently in that an on-going programme of construction of student accommodation is highly necessary. It is unfortunate that the Government should be putting obstacles in the path of that with this measure, and retrospective obstacles at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 78 would exempt from the provisions of the clause borrowing undertaken by educational institutions, registered housing associations, charities and other not-for-profit organisations. Amendment No. 77 would exempt the debts incurred by those institutions before 29 November, eliminating that retrospective element. Amendment No. 79 provides a definition of the bodies to which the other measures would relate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that, in general terms, we support the Government's aim in the clause of clamping down on the exploitation of tax avoidance, but the institutions to which we refer in the amendments are not guilty of anything which could meaningfully be called tax avoidance. They are guilty merely of using in good faith the provisions of the law the better to advance a laudable and public purpose. It is unfair and wrong that they should be penalised in the way that the Government are proposing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand that the legislation is aimed at the trading subsidiaries of banks which take advantage of the present law to defer and minimise taxation on what is economically interest, either by its being realised at the completion date of the loan or by its being restructured as a capital gain. We have no argument with the principle of the Government's attempt to tackle that avoidance, although even on those grounds there is a real argument about whether retrospection can be justified. I look forward to the justification that the Financial Secretary gives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our principal concern is for the effects on not-for-profit organisations. I should like to stress the impact on housing associations as well as on universities and other not-for-profit organisations, which are innocent victims of the change and will be hit hard—in some cases very hard. I agree with the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, who said that while Government amendment No. 223 is of some limited help, it does not go nearly far enough towards recognising the difficult situation of the bodies affected and the compelling case for them to receive particular consideration. Even within its limited terms, the Government amendment does not extend to charities in general, only to educational institutions and housing associations and it is plainly inadequate because it does not change the economic realities which will confront those institutions: a form of borrowing to which they are contractually committed and which was cheaper is now to become much more expensive. The Government amendment merely gives them a year or so to try and reorganise their affairs to soften the impact of the blow, rather than changing the fundamental nature of the blow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing associations and universities are particularly badly affected. Housing associations have raised considerable sums through qualifying index securities and other discounted securities. The National Federation of Housing Associations puts the total sum raised at more than £130 million and there is no doubt that the extra tax charge that will result from the Government's proposals is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0736">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>409</span>
all too likely to fall on borrowers rather than lenders because of the way in which such contracts are drafted. That will result in significant financial difficulties for several housing associations and schemes that are financed through those devices, and it will force up rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Federation of Housing Associations consulted its members on the likely effects of the provision on schemes financed by qualifying index securities. Sanctuary Housing Association believed that rents on affected properties would rise by 14 per cent.; Jephson Homes rents would rise by 16 per cent. and Touchstone Housing Association rents would rise by 38 per cent. The Peabody Trust calculated that the measure could cost it £2 million. The Peabody Trust did not translate it into a rent increase, but said that it was the equivalent of an extra 56 family-sized homes. It said that the homes lost,
	<br><blockquote><p>"would be permanent accommodation for families in London who are possibly at present either in bed and breakfast or temporary accommodation."</p></blockquote>
As a former housing Minister, the Financial Secretary will know the importance of the provision of housing through housing associations and oilier means in order to meet social needs. It cannot be right to impose additional financial pressures on associations and, in the case of universities, to do so retrospectively. We are talking about agreements that were entered into in good faith in full accordance with the law of the time and during a period when the Government were actively encouraging housing associations and other organisations to have recourse to private finance to fund their schemes. Furthermore, the securities issued were especially suited to the needs of housing associations because they were structured in such a way as to provide a hedge against inflation and to match the pattern of repayment to the association's typical cashflow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Federation of Housing Associations stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is nonsense to suggest that housing associations were in some way involved in tax avoidance or the exploitation of a loophole. Qualifying index securities were issued by housing associations strictly in accordance with the provisions and—as far as they were able to tell—the spirit of recently introduced legislation. Each issue was made only after so-called 'section 9 consent' (under the Housing Associations Act 1985) had been given by the Housing Corporation (which even includes a box in which details of qualifying index securities issued have to be recorded on financial monitoring returns). A number of issues were brought for specific clearance to officials of the Treasury and the Departments of Health and of the Environment. Finally, in a number of conversations, the competent officers at Inland Revenue Technical division expressed the view that these instruments are ideally suited for financing housing associations because of the long term nature and characteristics of their cash flows."</p></blockquote>
Having complied with the law, having entered those agreements in good faith and having received that guidance from the Government, are those associations not justified in feeling that they have been led up the garden path and that they are being badly let down by this change in the law, which can only have a serious effect on their activities and tenants?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To strengthen the case about guidance from other parts of Government, is the hon. Gentleman aware of the document recently issued by the Department for Education entitled "Education means Business" which
	<span class='label label-info column'>410</span>
specifically relates to private finance in education? The document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Universities and colleges have traditionally relied upon public funding for all significant capital spending projects but this is now changing. Government spending plans allow for capital funding from HEFCE to rise by some 20 per cent. in real terms between 1993–94 and 1996–97 but substantially increased capital requirements can be met only with further injections of private sector finance."</p></blockquote>
That really strengthens the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely—the hon. Gentleman provides further and compelling evidence for my case. Organisations, whether housing associations, are right to feel, not only seriously let down, but misled over agreements into which they entered in good faith and in the best interests of the tenants and students whom they serve. There have been many representations on this matter from housing associations and universities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must emphasise that the Government's response—this meagre amendment—is wholly inadequate, because it fails to answer the fundamental point that the cost of financing those schemes will significantly increase as a consequence of the Government's proposals. Given that the main target of the measures were subsidiary activities into which the banks were entering and that we have a clearly identified group of organisations which are serving the public interest and not making profits for shareholders, why cannot the Government simply exempt that group from the provisions, as we propose in our amendments?

The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington spoke about the special needs of universities and I should like to reinforce his remarks in terms of the powerful case advanced by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals of the Universities of the United Kingdom. In its brief—which other members of the Committee will have received—the committee alluded to the important fact that student numbers have increased dramatically in recent years, which has resulted in an increased need for student accommodation, yet universities cannot have recourse to public funds for the provision of such accommodation. Where else are they to look but to the most efficient and best value ways of borrowing to fund the provision of the accommodation needed? They, like housing associations, would arguably have been in default of their fiduciary responsibilities if they had not sought the cheapest and most efficient means of funding those schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals points out that the institutions headed by its members are charities and would therefore be unable to abuse those schemes for profit—there is no question of them doing so. They have simply been trying to get the best deal for the public and for the students whom they serve. As the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington pointed out, they have been actively encouraged by the Government, and especially by the Department for Education, to borrow in order to finance that sort of expenditure, and to borrow from the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his advice.

At the end of the day, that is how we can help those institutions and those whom they serve, who have been so unfairly affected by the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give examples of the specific effects on universities. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) drew the Government's attention to the particular difficulties confronting the university of Aberdeen. He received what I can only describe as an unhelpful reply from the Financial Secretary. The right hon. Gentleman's letter was dated Valentine's day, but it was clear that there was no love lost as far as the argument was concerned. The letter stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our proposals aim to bring the tax liability on the lender of such securities broadly in line with what it would have been had the bank involved lent the money directly. Nothing in this directly affects the borrower, although it is not uncommon for the contract to contain terms imposing new obligations on the borrower in the event that the tax advantage hitherto enjoyed by the lender is eliminated. If Aberdeen University has chosen to borrow on this basis, I imagine that the consequences of our proposal are unwelcome, but it would have been apparent from the outset that the borrowing rates achieved depended critically on particular tax rules remaining unchanged and were accordingly insecure."</p></blockquote>
There we have it: the Government put a particular tax regime in operation—they introduced those instruments and rules in the mid and late 1980s—and have the nerve to change them retrospectively, disadvantage people, then turn round to them and say, "You should have known all along that you couldn't trust us on taxation." People have learnt that lesson. It is something of an admission, however, to read it in the Financial Secretary's own letter. He went out to state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is entirely desirable that universities should borrow money from private sources, and I do not particularly complain that they should do so on terms structured to secure an advantageous tax position for the lenders. In such circumstances, however, they must accept the risk—along with other borrowers—that tax law will subsequently change to remove that advantage. It follows that I do not see any basis for simply excluding universities, or any other particular class of borrower, from the scope of our proposals—even where the securities in question were issued before Budget Day."</p></blockquote>
The Financial Secretary will have to do better than that in his reply to the Committee today if he is to persuade us and those housing associations, tenants, universities and students affected that the Government understand the meaning of natural justice and are prepared to abide by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other universities face difficulties similar to those to which my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North drew attention when he spoke of what is happening in Aberdeen. The Financial Secretary's response will be equally unwelcome there. It is important to spell out such things so that rhetorical or debating flourishes in the Committee or vague notions for amendments to the Bill, have real and serious consequences for people affected by the Government's bad faith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>412</span>
Manchester university has used qualifying index securities to build accommodation for 9,600 students. Rents have been calculated on the basis of the financial package arranged, not unreasonably, through qualifying index securities. If the Government's proposals are enacted, rents at Manchester will need to increase by nearly 7 per cent. We all know the pressures that students are under due to the contrast between the low levels of student support and the actual costs of being at university. We know how hard many students find it to make ends meet. To threaten them with a rent increase of 7 per cent. banged on in such a way is totally unfair and unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through a qualifying index security, the London School of Economics has built a £10 million student residence complex at Bankside. If there is no exemption of the sort that we are arguing for, the LSE estimates that rents will have to increase by £9 a week to take account of the increased costs incurred. How does the Financial Secretary imagine that students will find that money?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred on Second Reading to what is happening at Portsmouth university. That university arranged a qualifying index security but has yet to issue it. However, it has already incurred professional charges of £530,000 for legal and financial advice which it has had to pay up front—that money will be lost, wasted and thrown away if no exemption is granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals of the Universities of the United Kingdom estimates that more than a dozen universities have issued qualifying index securities at a total value of about £300 million. If we do not provide exemption, there will be a severe impact on particular schemes for universities and housing associations. Yet the cost of such an exemption would be minimal compared to the sums the Government would get back from the agreed closure of the loophole which affects the wider activities of banking subsidiaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our case is based on elementary fairness and natural justice. The effect of the Government's proposals on institutions serving public needs and not operating for profit is indefensible. They are as unfair as they are damaging. Housing associations and universities provide an invaluable public service. Both are under considerable financial pressures as a consequence of Government policies. At a time when the Government should be helping those bodies, they are instead administering what can only be called a kick in the teeth. It would be fair to exempt housing associations, universities and not-for-profit bodies. At the very least, they should have been exempted from the retrospective effects of the Bill. The Government should reconsider the matter. We will press our amendments to a vote and we will support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington if it goes to a vote because this involves a fundamental issue of fairness. The Government are inflicting wanton damage on institutions that deserve better.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington and the hon. Member for Oxford, East expressed concern about the effect of the provisions on universities and other non-taxpaying entities. I should like to highlight one or two other aspects. Universities that build halls of residence using that type of finance are involved in projects that continue over several years. Those projects are not designed to be one-offs because a hall of residence is not built quickly. With finance being removed mid-project, which is what the clause will do, the universities will be left with the problem of replacing that finance in a way that will allow them to provide cheap accommodation for students. There is a shortage of such accommodation, not only in London but in other large cities with famous and well-established universities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us are worried about the retrospection element of the provision. As has been said, most of the instruments will have measures to allow banks to pass on additional costs to the borrower if the tax regime alters. Banks will not suffer the cost of the alteration, but the borrower will have to bear the full amount. That will penalise those institutions that most of us want to be able to access funds because they will find the cost difficult to afford which will cause them to cut back elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of us find the basis of retrospection objectionable. Government amendment No. 223 tries to meet the problem of retrospection by making the commencement date 1 April 1996, which will alleviate the problem to some extent. Will many of the instruments have a life that extends beyond 1 April 1996? If the universities and housing associations could consider restructuring the instruments so that they are not affected adversely—they might have to borrow for new projects and the continuation of existing problems in a different way—most of the problems of retrospection would be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem is that the clause will tax subsidiary banks. There is a question whether banks have been the only issuers of that type of instrument. That point was raised by the British Bankers Association, which is worried that other entities—venture capital entities, and quasi-banks—have issued that type of paper. Does my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary think that it would be appropriate to consider that matter, and to broaden the clause so that it taxes banking subsidiaries and the other subsidiaries that might have issued that type of paper?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carrington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not suggesting that for one instant.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary should review the clause to see whether the issue of retrospection needs to be reviewed, and whether exemption should be made to allow non-taxpaying interests to readjust their affairs and to replace borrowing with different sources of finance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Margaret Hodge 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barking)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall start by declaring several non-pecuniary interests. I chair a housing association, I am the governor on the board of the London School of Economics and a member of the governing body of the university of London. I must apologise to you, Mr. Winterton, because I shall have to leave after making my short contribution to the debate. I waited patiently through the lengthy discussions today—the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West, who has now disappeared, spoke at length. I had hoped that we could have had a longer debate on this issue, about which members on both sides of the Committee are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary said earlier that he consults where it makes sense. It might have made sense to consult about this matter before the proposals in the Finance Bill came at us like a bolt out of the blue. Had he consulted, he might have seen the trap into which he has now fallen. He might also have avoided the incompetence of which he is accused, because of the detrimental effect that the proposals will have on housing associations, universities and charities. All those bodies have been using the instruments—and have been following Government policy—to encourage private finance investment in public initiatives. It seems odd to say the least—and one could use stronger words—that the proposals will make it much more difficult for the private finance initiative to be a success just when the Government were hoping to revive it. That could be avoided if the amendments in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East and others were accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As other hon. Members have said, the instruments that have been used by housing associations and universities have been used to further their objectives, not to avoid taxation. The deep discount securities were introduced in the 1984 Budget and the deep gain securities in the 1989 Budget. Housing associations started using these instruments in 1989—five years after they had first come in. By that time, one can assume, the Government would have had some knowledge of whether the banking institutions were using them as a tax avoidance scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When housing associations first started using these instruments, they of course sought the correct permission from the Housing Corporation with their section 9 consents, which were granted after a thorough investigation. Had the measure been a tax avoidance one, one would have thought that the Housing Corporation—the Government's own agent—would identify the fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing associations also work with health authorities to provide accommodation for junior doctors and nurses. Such schemes were thoroughly vetted by the Department of Health and the Treasury. Nobody said that they were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0739">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
wrong or that they were seen as mechanisms for avoiding tax, but legislation is now being brought in on the assumption that institutions such as housing associations, universities and other charitable organisations are using the scheme wrongly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the concerns of some of my hon. Friends over retrospective legislation and I should like to comment briefly on Government amendment No. 223. Various interested parties have advised me that simply giving a further year to reschedule debts will not assist housing associations or universities in any way. The existing loans have years to run and it will therefore be difficult for the organisations concerned to do anything other than pay the tax that will then be due. It seems odd that the change in question should apply to subsisting debts rather than new ones that could be incurred in future, when other tax changes are not to be retrospective. Will the Financial Secretary consider that, at least as an interim compromise?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, East has spoken of the impact on the LSE, which is one of the organisations with which I am connected. The LSE says that if the schemes were abandoned, it would no longer embark on any new schemes to make provisions for students. We all know that, given the state of the housing market in London, that is an important ingredient in ensuring that there are healthy higher education institutions in the capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing associations have used approximately £130 million of these securities, £85 million of which has gone into deep gain and deep discount securities. If the Government's proposals were introduced, the Treasury would gain the interest on the tax being brought forward. The other £50 million has gone into qualifying index securities. If we assume that inflation is running at about 3 per cent. and that tax will take about one third of that—1 per cent.—approximately half a million pounds would be lost to the Treasury if the current securities which housing associations have taken out were excluded from the provision. That is a trivial sum—I have seen millions and billions of pounds floating around on the pluses and minuses as we go through the Bill—to ensure that we maintain this important private investment in housing associations so that their rents are affordable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing associations have taken advantage of such security because it is sensible in terms of their business. Tenants pay low rents and the earning investment necessary to create affordable housing is high. Deep discount or deep gain securities are good because they provide the opportunity for low repayments in the early stages. Housing associations must ensure that they have the money at the end of the day to repay loans and they operate in a market in which rents change unpredictably. QIS's reflect a prudent financial strategy on the part of housing associations for coping with the risks that they incur in bringing private finance to play on their investments. That strategy is a good hedge against inflation and interest rates. Most importantly, it has probably saved the Treasury some money because it has allowed housing associations to provide housing at affordable rents which means that the housing benefit bill is probably lower than it would otherwise have been and people have been kept out of bed and breakfast, which is an alternative that would have had to have been used and which would have cost local authorities and the Treasury more money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>
It would be sensible for the Financial Secretary to reconsider his proposals, especially in relation to housing associations and to exclude them from this attempt to close a tax avoidance scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concur with the hon. Member for Fulham that the Government's proposals will not achieve their objective because they attack not a category of investor but a category of investment. The institutions that have become involved in QIS's will escape and housing associations, higher education institutions and so on will beaver away trying to find other investment institutions through which to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that they have lost £100 million in tax revenue, but it is not reasonable, because some people have acted improperly to avoid tax, to attack bona fide long-term borrowings that have met the Government's financial and policy objectives and the objectives that we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision deals a double whammy to housing associations in the form of penal double taxation. The deep gain and QIS's will be deemed to be disposed of and re-acquired every year at market value. If a security has a value of £90 in year one and £110 in year two, tax will be payable on the £20. If the value goes down to £90 in year three there will be no tax, but if in year four the value rises to £110 tax will again be payable. That element of double taxation should be examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition amendments would enable the Government to deal with tax avoidance by the associates of banks and to close the loophole without damaging charitable institutions—housing associations and higher education institutions—or undermining the very purpose that the Government wish to pursue and which we support through the private finance initiative. I urge the Financial Secretary to show some common sense and perhaps to use this Committee as a consultation process. He must rethink the proposals, not cause great damage to the housing association movement, to higher education and to other non-charitable institutions, which use private finance to create new assets from which the community can benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is an important debate and I hope that the Financial Secretary is taking note of the points being made and giving them serious consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One specific issue that has arisen is that, while there is general consensus among all members of the Committee that tax loopholes should be eliminated—there are differing opinions on how and where, but the basic principle is agreed—a real problem may arise if tax loopholes are closed in a way that creates uncertainty, instability and a lack of confidence, both at home and abroad, about what is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge) made a pertinent point about the private finance initiative. If that initiative is to be developed, some kind of incentive must be built in so that private companies come in and share the risk. They are unlikely to do so, even if the Government offer a fairly generous incentive, if it is known that as soon as the Government realise how generous they have been, they will change the rules and apply the change retrospectively to claw back the tax. The Financial
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0740">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>417</span>
Secretary should acknowledge that that sort of reputation—which the hon. Member for Oxford, East legitimately made fun of—has serious effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, my interest is specifically in the impact of the changes on universities. My local university—Aberdeen—has made representations to several, if not all, members of the Committee and was referred to by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington in his opening remarks. Only two weeks ago, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North and I attended a dinner at the university to celebrate its 500th anniversary. It is the fifth-oldest university in Britain and Aberdeen proudly boasts that, for a time, it had two universities when there were only two universities in the whole of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, for the past few years, Aberdeen university has experienced considerable ups and downs, due to the vagaries of changing Government policy. A few years ago, I raised the subject in an Adjournment debate because of the severe squeeze that was being put on the university as part of the general policy of cutting general funding for universities. Over two successive years, the support grant to Aberdeen university was cut by 22 per cent., the number of students was reduced to slightly more than 5,000 and the university was in deep financial trouble. The Government then stood their policy on its head, and universities were encouraged to take on more students. In the space of approximately five years, from the point of being squeezed almost out of existence, Aberdeen university doubled the number of its students to nearly 10,000. That in itself is not a testimony to good education planning by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the process of expanding its student numbers, the university has had to deal with problems of student accommodation. Members of the Committee will understand that the population changes in Aberdeen have been unrivalled by anywhere else in the country during the past 15 to 20 years, except Milton Keynes—I am sorry that the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West is now absent from the Committee. My constituency of Gordon has successively experienced the highest rate of population growth of anywhere in the country. The consequence of that growth has been severe pressure on housing and on student accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The university has been forced to try to make provision for students because the private sector market in Aberdeen offers no accommodation at prices that students can afford, because availability is so restricted. However, I should point out that the maximum student grant available to students in Aberdeen, which is nationally determined, does not even cover the cost of accommodation, never mind food, drink, light and other essentialss that keep students' bodies and souls together. Students take on private debts and moonlighting jobs to supplement their grants and, even men, they are able to keep going only because the university took advantage of the sorts of schemes that we are talking about to finance the provision of new halls of residence which have been built in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his letter to the Committee, the finance director of the university said that the university borrowed £24 million by way of QIS. He made a pertinent point about retrospection—had the scheme not been available, the university would not have commended itself to it. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>
university was advised to take up the scheme by its bankers who were aware of the tax benefit. Because the tax benefit is likely to be withdrawn restrospectively, they will have to refinance those loans and incur aditional costs. I do not know exactly what the cost of refinancing will be or what the effect of the tax will be, but the Committee can easily work out that the interest on £24 million, well managed, is a significant contribution to dealing with the problems of student accommodation in Aberdeen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of not having that money is likely to be felt not only by the university's general accounts, but in the form of student hardship. The university's students' representative council recently lobbied local Members of Parliament on the growing problem of poverty in the university and the consequent effect that it is having on the drop-out rate. If students do not complete their courses, not because they are failing academically but because they cannot sustain themselves financially, public money is wasted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must realise that the legislation not only further squeezes universities, which have already been badly knocked about as a result of unpredictable changes in Government policy; it also affects students, who are suffering from real cuts in their grants, cuts in the benefits available to them and inadequate provision of accommodation at anything like affordable rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse the remarks that have been made about housing associations, although I do not think that any of those in my constituency have been directly affected. Nevertheless, the arguments that have been expressed demonstrate that it is a policy of robbing Peter to pay Paul. The Government encourage private initiatives involving housing associations and universities, then tax them for the privilege. That is just moving public money around or putting the squeeze in different places at different times. Nothing creative is being done. I wonder whether the Financial Secretary has considered what the cost will be of the squeeze on universities and housing associations. It will mean fewer houses, less student accommodation, greater hardship for people looking for rented accommodation and for students at universities. What will that cost in terms of problems for local authorities, social services and others?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's amendment provides a breathing space of a year, but it does not resolve the problem. To achieve the correct balance on retrospection, surely it would be more appropriate for the Financial Secretary to accept that the clause should apply only to new schemes with effect from the date of the Budget or the operative date in the Bill. Schemes commenced prior to that should be allowed to run their course taking advantage of the tax benefit that previously applied. I know that that will cost money, but I suspect that it will not cost as much as the Financial Secretary may calculate if he takes account of the other factors that I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be an important indicator of confidence. It would show that, although we will close loopholes, we will not chop and change the regime at short notice and at whim to undermine the confidence of public institutions at home and potential investors in public finance initiatives abroad in the stability and continuity of any sort of incentive that the Government introduce. If they do that, they are doomed to discourage people from believing that the incentives mean what they are supposed to and,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0741">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>419</span>
because of the cost, from entering schemes that can be changed at will and retrospectively. On both counts, therefore, the Financial Secretary should take on board the clear concern on both sides of the Committee about the implications of his proposals. Constructive suggestions have been put to him and, if he wants to avoid a division—something that none of us feel is necessary—it would be better if he would agree to return with alternative proposals. He should present proposals on how to allow those measures that had been taken out to continue to apply and on the specifics of changing the operative date from the date of the Budget. In that way he would achieve his long-term aim of closing the loophole without causing additional hardship for universities and housing associations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Stevenson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Opposition amendments. In so doing, I cannot resist a feeling of déjà-vu. The Government have embarked once more on a U-turn on a tax break that they established. In fact, the Bill's more controversial aspects make me feel that the Government's eagerness to remove tax breaks is matched only by their determination to create others. I suspect that it will not be too long before the Committee will be sat in this Room, considering amendments couched in similar terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to be impressed by the Government's sleight of hand. When those tax breaks were established in 1984 and 1989 I have no doubt that they were identified as examples of the Government's determination to create tax incentives and push private initiatives forward. However, those breaks are now regarded as tax loopholes. When does a tax incentive become a tax loophole? When will the Government wake up and take action because their established tax incentives have become a tax loophole?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's insistence on changing the rules in this regard is a matter for serious concern. That concern has been expressed by both sides of the Committee. Non-profit-making organisations are worried. They have done no more than use the Government's rules to generate desperately needed resources that have been well used. I have heard no one argue that the organisations—housing associations, universities, charities and others—have not put their resources to good use. If someone could show that they have not put them to good use, the Government might have a stronger case. If the Committee were minded to support Government amendment No. 223 it should appreciate that it will be the cause of considerable damage—make no mistake about it. Some of that damage will be to the Government's quickly diminishing reputation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Inland Revenue has been upset about some of the ways in which such securities have been used. It is concerned about the ability to lend to non-UK residents—to export tax breaks. That matter should be examined as it is important. We would support any Government proposal to deal with that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Revenue is concerned about the lending between banks, where the banks have used the tax break to support risk-free lending. The measures were not supposed to be used in that way. We should also like to examine that aspect.

It is difficult to resist the feeling that, once more, the Government have been caught napping. Organisations
	<span class='label label-info column'>420</span>
and individuals have taken advantage of tax breaks deliberately introduced by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with those people who believe that this aspect of the tax regime might have been subject to some abuse. In fact, we can go further than that and say that it has clearly been abused. But the QIS's were created by statute. They were not an oversight by the Government and were not the product of that army of people engaged in identifying tax dodges.

There is a distinction between a loophole that has been utilised as a result of a Government decision, such as that to create the regime under discussion, and an abuse that has not been intended. The problems must be addressed in different ways. If the Government act on overt abuse, they will receive our support, but if the tax regime is being used in the way identified by housing associations and universities, a different approach is required. That is what the amendments are about. We are telling the Government not to throw the baby out with the bath water. They should examine the regime in more detail because it needs fine tuning. Do not throw away the good with the bad. If there are abuses, identify them and act on them, but for goodness' sake do not introduce a measure that will damage the good work that is being done. While removing abuse, the Government must fine tune the proposals and consider the amendments carefully so that we obtain protection for the good work of the organisations mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate focuses on another important issue—how universities, housing associations and so on receive long-term finance. Such finance is difficult because the system is racked with short-termism. I took particular note, as I am sure other hon. Members did, that the Chancellor's speech in November never mentioned short-termism. The Red Book has no mention of it. Many hon. Members believe that until we have addressed that issue, however, we shall continue to encounter difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stevenson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was explaining how the DDBs and QISs were important in raising resources for non-profit-making organisations. Those organisations have experienced difficulty because of what I called chronic short-termism. In general, banks remain the most flexible source of finance, especially for smaller companies. Banks are also extremely nervous about taking long-term risks—reams of evidence show that. Short-termism rules and the nervousness that banks have about taking long-term risks is uppermost in the minds of housing associations, universities, charities and other organisations that have used the relevant financial provisions. The Government should consider what reforms might encourage banks to lend longer term. The Government's proposals will remove the positive elements of the tax regimes as well as the possible abuses.

	<span class='label label-info column'>421</span>
I was fascinated but astonished to read the Budget press release of 29 November 1994, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Chancellor proposes in his Budget to take action against the use of special purpose subsidiaries by banks to defer or possibly eliminate tax liability on returns."</p></blockquote>
The press release portrayed an almost gung-ho approach. That statement would deserve a great deal of support, but there is no mention of the fact that the Government established the tax regimes in the first place and no mention of the effect that the proposals, as set out in the clause, would have on housing associations, universities, charities and other organisations which depend on the use of the tax breaks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have thought that the Chancellor's determination to address the abuses in the system—which would, I repeat, gain our support—would have more credibility had the total picture been put out in the press release, rather than just selective parts. We witness this sort of situation often—the Government create a problem, then they take action to address it and claim credit for having done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to add some further comments to what has already been said about housing associations and illustrate the dangers inherent in the Government's proposals. Housing associations face many pressures—they are not unique in that—and in particular they are required by the Housing Act 1988 to consider mixed public and private funding for development programmes. That is exactly what they have done, and now it appears that they will be penalised for it. They are under further pressure from declining Government grants, so they have sought ways to meet their funding needs by utilising both elements in the tax regime. As my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East said earlier, if the facility were removed by the Government, the effect on rents would be catastrophic. Housing associations and tenants would suffer from the clause simply because they had acted in accordance with what the Government laid down in 1984 and 1989, not through any illegal operations or tax-avoidance operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 77, 78 and 79 should be supported because they would remove the potential for abuse, but maintain the benefits, as I am sure every member of the Committee wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like all hon. Members who have spoken so far, I accept that the Government's primary intention is to deal with a problem of tax avoidance between associates of banks who are borrowing and lending between themselves for that purpose. The Government are quite right to try to stop that abuse, but in the process they have achieved other results which were, perhaps, not their primary intention. I hope that the Financial Secretary will at least keep an open mind on the amendments and try to recognise their importance to housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have, as a stated policy, reduced the housing association grant as a percentage of the funds needed by associations to develop new projects and have tried to encourage them to lever in more private finance. Associations have tried to do that, though it has increasingly resulted in higher rent levels and the Government have been picking up those rents in higher benefit bills. It has been more difficult for associations as
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>
the number of newer schemes with lower housing action trust funding come on stream. The associations have proportionately fewer, older schemes with higher HAT funding against which they can pool their rents, which has meant higher rents. With the flattening off of house prices in the past few years, it has also meant that the capital assets of associations have not been rising in a way which would enable them to borrow against those rising values as they did in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing association movement has had problems and we are anxious to avoid a further problem being added to an already delicate situation in which some lenders in the market—I mentioned Nationwide building society, with which I am at present doing an Industry and Parliament Trust placement—are cautioning that, if the process goes any further, they do not believe the funding of some housing association schemes will be viable. That means that fewer houses will be built and there will be less hope for homeless families and others in housing need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can accept that the Government's initial aim was right. However, housing associations have gone in, in quite a big way, for qualifying index securities, because they perceive them to be a good way in which to fund long-term investment in their housing stock. Clearly, tax benefits accrue to the associates of banks who enter into those arrangements, but the benefit is largely passed on the association that issues the security to the bank associates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons housing associations believe that that is a good method of borrowing are, first, that the risk tends to be index linked, which therefore reduces the associations' exposure to changes and fluctuations in the economy. Secondly, it is a long-term arrangement, which is the proper way to fund housing which is a long-term investment. Thirdly, it is low start in many cases and therefore balances the outgoings and rental income of associations. Some advisors have said that the economic factors affecting the securities tend to be the same as those that affect the rent levels of housing associations. Therefore associations are unlikely to find that their outgoings and income are out of sync. QISs are very good mechanisms by which housing associations can fund their investments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friends have already said, housing associations have been subject to section 9 consent from the Housing Corporation and, in some cases, they have gone as far as the Treasury to obtain consent. The Government are not changing the law in regard to tax advantages of all discounted and index-linked securities. If that were the case, everyone would understand that there would be no more tax advantages for securities of this kind and housing associations would have to accept the change along with everyone else. However, the Government are not doing that; they are simply removing those tax advantages—probably quite rightly in most cases—from the associates of banks. It just so happens that the impact of that falls on to housing associations, which tend to issue such securities to the associates of banks, rather than to other institutions. They have good reasons for doing so, about which I shall speak shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Financial Secretary will agree that most of the agreements into which housing associations have entered have been structured in such a way that, if those tax advantages are removed, the cost of that will not fall
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0743">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>423</span>
on the banks or associates of banks, but on the housing associations. Virtually all the agreements have been formulated in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If tax advantages are being removed only from the associates of banks, it might be asked why the housing associations do not go to other institutions, or find other ways of issuing QISs that will still obtain the tax advantages for those institutions that picked up the securities. Again, taking advice from people involved in this field, it appears that the banks have a particular knowledge and expertise and are especially comfortable with housing associations. They understand housing associations' mechanisms and structures and are therefore generally prepared to enter into borrowing arrangements at a lower cost that other institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apparently, some housing associations have tried, throught the THFC, to issue securities into the public market, but have generally found that that is more expensive that issuing securities of this sort to banks and that the securities are not as well protected against economic factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important point is that, because they are less certain about housing associations and how they operate, other institutions have tended to require a higher valuation for any debt into which they are prepared to enter. That is a problem because, when housing associations build properties, the value of those properties when newly built is not the same as the building costs. The market value may only be 75 per cent. of the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the institutions are saying that they will have a ratio between the debt and the valuation of 150 per cent. and the valuation is less than the building price, institutions may be prepared to lend less than 50 per cent. of the cost of new build houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's intention is to reduce HAT levels. Their policies are therefore in direct contradiction. The Government are encouraging housing associations to reduce the amount of HAT and increase the amount of private finance. If the ability of associations to issue securities to the banks is removed and they have to issue them to other institutions which will not take as favourable a view on the amount of debt to value that they will offer, housing associations may be unable to raise the difference between the HAT funding and the total cost. Schemes may therefore become non-viable. That is important because the Government's intention is not to remove all tax advantages from the securities but simply to remove them from the associates of banks. If the tax advantages exist for other institutions but those institutions will not lend at the same level and schemes are not viable for housing associations, the Government will score an own goal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that penal conditions are attached to the Government's proposals and that gains which securities are deemed to accrue from year to year would be taxed, but relief would not be allowed on losses. That penal proposal is understandable if the intention is to stop lending and borrowing between associates of banks which are conducted only to avoid tax. The problem for housing associations is that their arrangements with institutions cannot be wound up at a moment's notice. They fund homes and their arrangements are long term. The penal
	<span class='label label-info column'>424</span>
conditions will not discourage that form of security being issued by housing associations. It will simply be more costly for them to fund those that they have already entered into. I hope that the Financial Secretary will consider that problem of retrospection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be no saving for the Government in gross terms because of the letting-out effect. The benefits of the arrangements are passed on to housing associations and because they use that cheaper money to reduce rents, the Government will pick up the bill in higher rents in many cases. I obtained some information from the Nationwide building society on the schemes with which it has been involved. The rental for a property if the QIS arrangement were no longer available could rise by £13 a week. I am happy to show the figures to the Financial Secretary. The Nationwide calculated that the Government will pay extra benefit because in 78 per cent. of new lettings by housing associations people are in receipt of some sort of benefit and the Government pick up the total amount of any extra rent. The Nationwide estimates that the benefit paid by the Government on houses in which the tenant receives some sort of benefit will be greater than the tax saving that the Government will make by changing the rules. The Nationwide reckon that the Government will lose about £23 a year on each house that is built when the tenant is on housing benefit, which is in 78 per cent. of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the Government will make gains when people are not on benefit and where they do not, therefore, have to pick up the bill. However, that will widen the poverty trap and people who are not on benefit will pay a breakeven rent of £71 a week for the schemes that the Government are considering, rather than £58 a week for schemes financed through QISs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary should take account of those issues; they are potentially very damaging. The Government did not, perhaps, intend that damage, but they have got into difficulties with it. I might ask the right hon. Gentleman whether there is still a little of the poacher left in him or whether he has turned completely gamekeeper on this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Carshalton and Wallington and for Fulham for the way in which they tabled their amendments, which demonstrate their concern about universities and housing associations. Those concerns were echoed in many of the speeches by Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members all said that they broadly agreed with the thrust of clause 77. The hon. Members for Oxford, East, for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) and for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) all said that the Government sought to block off a loophole, and they broadly supported that. However, they went on to say that, although this is an inappropriate instrument, they wanted exemption—indefinitely, to judge by their amendment—for particular types of borrowing, such as that by universities and housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly say what the clause does, to put this debate in context. As the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) said, legislation was introduced in 1984 to encourage the issue of deep discount bonds to help diversify United Kingdom companies' sources of funding and allow them easier access to long-term fixed-cost funds. In 1989, legislation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0744">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>425</span>
providing for QISs was designed to remove tax impediments to the issuance of index securities, again giving better access to borrowing at extended maturities, protected against fluctuations in nominal interest rates. Clearly, Ministers had in mind genuine issuance to the market at large as an alternative to bank borrowing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objectives of that legislation are not served if bilateral bank lending is just dressed up with the formal characteristics of bond issuance. This is an anti-avoidance provision, as the Chancellor made clear in his Budget speech. As such, it falls into the second half of the two categories that I outlined in earlier debates, on one of which we did not consult. It would have been difficult for us to have done what the hon. Member for Barking said, which was, first, to consult before we took action and, secondly, to exempt particular categories of borrowers. That would have given signals to housing associations and universities to borrow quickly while stocks lasted. It makes sense when one proposes an anti-avoidance provision with which there is no serious disagreement to proceed without consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is aimed at a range of structures that are adopted by some banking groups and which are quite artificial—others are less so. The most clear cut instance of the mischief that the clause addresses occurs when essentially bilateral lending transactions are clothed in the formal characteristics of an issuance of securities to secure lower or later tax liabilities for the lending group than would have arisen from more straightforward lending. The borrowing institution issues so many million pounds worth of securities, perhaps on zero coupon terms, and the whole issue is taken up by the subsidiary of a banking institution on terms that are pre-planned to divide the benefit of the tax break between the institutions. The banker then simply holds the securities until redemption—perhaps decades later—and only then does the banking institution pay its tax. In the case of indexed securities, the banking group will pay tax only on the coupon and that is much lower than on conventional unindexed borrowing. The indexation uplift to the loan principal falls out of the charge altogether. Lenders and borrowers—the latter quite possibly resident outside the United Kingdom—thus get a tax subsidy that was never intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause counteracts that, not by imposing special tax penalties on those structures, but by charging them broadly in step with the charge that would apply to loans advanced and securities bought directly by the parent bank. That is accompanied by provisions that do not disturb the treatment of returns that had already accrued at the time the proposal was announced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the exception of housing associations and universities—which I shall come to in a moment—it is striking that there has been little adverse reaction from lenders and borrowers affected by the clause, and they have made little attempt to argue that these are legitimate transactions consistent with the spirit of the legislation that they seek to exploit. The general reaction to the clause has been that it is a fair cop—and indeed it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received representations since the Budget to the effect that a number of housing associations and universities have taken out borrowings on terms caught by clause 77: about a dozen institutions in each sector—a small minority of all institutions—and a small proportion
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
of aggregate private sector borrowing by those two sectors. However, the impact of the clause is more significant for the institutions concerned. It would be inappropriate to allow those institutions continued access to a tax loophole that we are closing for all other borrowers. I am not sure that anyone argued for that. We are also reluctant to provide a complete exclusion, even for existing borrowings, in those two sectors. That is what the debate focused on this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the substantial cumulative cost, it would send an unhelpful signal as to the future behaviour of those institutions if they, uniquely, could get involved in tax-driven transactions on a no-risk basis. But I see some force in the argument that the immediate commencement envisaged in the Bill, backdated to the Budget, could cause disruption to the short-term financial plans of the institutions and a consequent risk of avoidable damage to our objectives both in social housing and higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government amendment will defer the coming into force of clause 77 until 1 April next year in the case of existing borrowings by housing associations and universities. That will give them a breathing space in which to reconsider their financial arrangements and, if they wish, to unwind the borrowings caught by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, I saw Dr. Edwards from the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals, Jim Coulter, the director of the National Federation of Housing Associations and representatives of the British Bankers Association. I listened to their case and it was after that meeting that the Government decided to table the amendment. If the hon. Member for Oxford, East has read to the end of my letter he would have seen that the Government were considering transitional provisions. We never led anyone to believe that we had the more dramatic and radical solution advocated by Opposition Members: that was never something that the Government entertained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with some of the questions and then I shall come on to the core of the argument. My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham asked about the lifespan of these borrowing instruments. He is quite right: many of them last beyond 1 April 1996, some last for 20 or 30 years. That is why total grandfathering exempting them has a substantial cost attached to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is also the reason why a year's breathing space, as my hon. Friend the Minister calls it, is not adequate to deal with the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, it is an argument that cuts both ways: it makes my hon. Friend's case and also makes mine. I shall come on to that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Fulham asked whether other bad guys were involved. It is true that the mischief addressed by the clause is not, in principle, restricted to the banks. Similar incentives to fragment could apply to other firms, such as building societies taxed as financial traders. The scope for avoidance is much greater for banks simply because corporate lending is at the core of their business, which is not the case for building societies. Restricting counteraction to banking groups at this stage seemed the best way of dealing with the bulk of the mischief while minimising the risk of accidentally catching inoffensive transactions. If other institutions show signs of stepping into the banks' shoes as suppliers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0745">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
of this sort of structured finance, we will not hesitate to reconsider the scope of our counteraction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington implied that this measure might damage the private finance initiative. This type of borrowing is not strictly an element of the PFI because there is no transfer of risk and reward to the providers of finance. It is fairly straightforward borrowing but restructured in a rather contrived way to bring a tax advantage to the lender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is right to make the basic point that we want to encourage private borrowings by universities and housing associations. That is the thrust of our policy. However, we do not want such institutions to use artificial, tax-driven devices such as have been created by subsidiaries of the banks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal in more detail with the specific case of that minority of housing associations and universities that have already borrowed money on terms that are now caught by clause 77. The hon. Member for Barking gave the figures: about a dozen housing associations out of 2,000 have borrowed about £150 million in aggregate and about a dozen universities out of around 100 have borrowed some £300 million in aggregate. Many of them and the relevant representative bodies have made representations to the effect that clause 77 should be amended in their favour. I know of no other educational institution, charity or non-profit-making organisation—on which one of the amendments touches—which has borrowed money on terms that are affected by clause 77.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I am aware, there is no technical difference between the borrowings by housing associations and universities and any other borrowing caught by clause 77 that would justify the former being singled out for special treatment. The borrowings, if one divorces them from the use to which the money is put, typically involve an issue of securities on a bilateral basis from a borrowing institution to a dedicated subsidiary of a bank on terms calculated to create a tax advantage to the lender. The borrowing costs of the loan are reduced to pass part of the tax advantage on to the borrower. Tax indemnity provisions in the loan agreement provide for future tax changes affecting the lender to be similarly passed through to the borrower. That might have flashed up some warning signals to the housing associations when they entered into such an agreement that there was a possibility that the tax regime would change, with the result that they would have to bear the costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the transaction that I have just described, in many cases somewhat artificial side agreements are in place which modify the ostensible characteristics of the borrowing: a university that has issued securities indexed to the retail prices index in fact pays an unindexed borrowing cost linked to the standard interbank benchmark rates, very much as it would on a straightforward bank loan. In effect what happens is that a bank or borrowing institution that normally would lend or borrow on straightforward terms reroutes the loan through the QIS to reap the tax advantage, but then amends it through a side agreement to get it back roughly to what it was. The whole structure is artificial and tax-driven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
As I said, the terms are dictated entirely by the tax advantage intended to be achieved. It must have been perfectly clear from the outset that that was so and that there was a clear risk that the hoped-for savings in borrowing costs would be disrupted by future tax changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see the case for allowing housing associations, universities or any other class of borrower unlimited future access for borrowing on such terms. Both sectors enjoy substantial support from public expenditure—over a billion pounds a year in each case. Nor do I see how that can be allowed to supplement that support on a self-service basis by condoning their continued use of tax avoidance techniques which are being closed down for everyone else. That would do some injustice to the way in which total public spending is kept under control. If a number of institutions could help themselves to extra cash in that way, it would also distort our procedures for allocating public expenditure between competing sectors and between institutions in a given sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Financial Secretary accept that the fact that housing associations now cannot place the securities with the associates of banks and thus get tax relief is historically distorting? Could they not get the tax relief by placing the securities elsewhere? Does the Financial Secretary mean that he intends to remove the tax advantages of discounted and index linked securities generally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That goes back to the original objectives of the 1984 and 1989 changes, which were to develop alternative lending sources to those provided by the banks. The aim was to develop bonds that were not issued by the banks—banks were specifically excluded. That developing market would not be caught by this clause, which applies only to subsidiaries of banks. Those are the transactions that have been caught and are being brought to a conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government apparently are worried about the tax position and the amount of tax that is collected, but the Financial Secretary seems to be saying that he would be happy for markets to develop elsewhere that would have the same impact on tax revenue. Why, then, does not he accept the amendment, and allow QISs to be issued by banks to housing associations? The impact on the Government's finances is the same whichever route he chooses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have explained why the Government want clause 77 to proceed. The hon. Gentleman did not deal with my second point—that the agreements are somewhat artificial in nature. Ostensibly, the loan is a QIS, but the side agreements mean that it is converted back into a LIBOR-linked loan. As I described, the device, in its totality, is somewhat artificial and tax-driven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, it is difficult to concede an out-and-out exclusion for existing borrowings for upwards of 20 or 30 years. That is what the debate has really been about. The cost of that could well amount to hundreds of millions of pounds over time. It would also send an inappropriate signal to the borrowers concerned that they, uniquely, can participate in tax-driven financial arrangements on the basis that heads they win and tails they do not lose. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0746">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>429</span>
institutions that used those adventurous techniques this time should be quicker to get onto the bandwagon next time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe, who I know is interested in housing, may have seen an article by Greer Nicholson in "Inside Housing" headed, "Is it worth the risk?" Its subheading said that the article weighed up
	<br><blockquote><p>"the wisdom of associations using tax loopholes to cut loan costs".</p></blockquote>
The article contained an interesting remark by the head of housing finance of Nat West Markets, Clive Barnett, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You need to be able to assess all the risks in these highly sophisticated products and I believe there are complex factors which may mean that most associations should not get involved."</p></blockquote>
That is why the Government concluded it would not be appropriate to give a total exemption. We want to make a genuine move to help the relevant bodies to adjust to the new regime. That is why we tabled Government amendment No. 223, which I hope the Committee will support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that I am disappointed by the response of my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary.

I live in hope that he may yet see the light about the main points the hon. Members have sought to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend said that the instruments are used over quite a long period. As he was generous enough to concede, that argument cuts both ways. It means that a change in the ground rules adversely affects the assumptions that were made by financial, educational and housing institutions. Those institutions believed that they were being at least tacitly encouraged by Ministers in the Treasury and the Department for Education to go into those projects as a way of raising cost-effective private finance capital for their capital programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I ask the Minister formally to move Government amendment No. 223, I urge all members of the Committee to pay attention when the Clerk is reading out a division list and to annunciate "yes" or "no" in a way that the Clerk can understand. I do not know whether any member of the Committee would expect the Clerk to accept no voice as an indication, but it is no excuse for any hon. Member to say that he or she was concentrating on something else. Otherwise, one side of the Committee may take offence and it may be necessary to call another division. We do not want to waste time in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 223, in page 78, line 20, leave out from "debt" to end of line 21 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(9) In sections 63 to 66 of the Finance Act 1993 as they apply by virtue of this section 'the commencement date' means—
	<ol>
	<li>in relation to a debt not falling within subsection (10) below, 29th November 1994; and</li>
	<li>in relation to a debt falling within that subsection, 1st April 1996.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(10) A debt falls within this subsection if the person liable for it is—
	<ol>
	<li>an institution which is a higher education institution for the purposes of section 65 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 or Article 30 of the Education and Libraries (Northern Ireland) Order 1993,</li>
	<li>an institution which is an institution within the higher education sector for the purposes of the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992, or</li>
	<li>a registered housing association within the meaning of the Housing Associations Act 1985 or Part II of the Housing (Northern Ireland) Order 1992,</li></ol>
and that person was so liable at the end of 28th November 1994."—[	<i>Sir G. Young.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 85, in page 78, line 21, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(9) A debt shall not be a qualifying debt for the purposes of subsection (1) above if the debtor is a company and that company is an unquoted trading company or the unquoted holding company of a trading group within the meaning of section 229 ICTA 1988.".</p></blockquote>
I rise briefly to bring to the attention of the Committee another aspect of the clause that the Government did not detect. In doing so, I again declare that I am an adviser to the British Venture Capital Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deep discount securities are widely used to fund venture capital. They differ from other types of investment because, by its very nature, venture capital is risky. Indeed, if the venture capital company fails, the discount might never be achieved. For that reason, I hope that my right hon. Friend will accept that the use of such security for funding venture capital is proper and appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
That causes no difficulties when the provider of venture capital is not a subsidiary of a bank. Companies such as 3Is have no problem with that. The wording of the clause, however, means that banks with venture capital subsidiaries will be caught. I do not believe that that is the Government's intention, because they want to attack the artificial transactions achieved by the banks establishing special subsidiaries specifically for the purpose of avoiding tax. However, long-established venture capital subsidiaries of banks—some of them have been trading in the market for many years—will be attacked by the provisions in the clause. The providers of venture capital would not be on a level playing field, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment would redress that situation by removing from the attack a debt to a non-trading company. I know that my right hon. Friend thinks that my amendment goes too wide. I considered removing the venture capital subsidiaries of banks by name, but there might also be problems with that. I hope that my right hon. Friend will respond by accepting that a problem has been created which was not the Government's intention and that, on Report, the Government might table an amendment to deal with the anomaly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to bring our proceedings to a conclusion with a bridge-building response to my hon. Friend's amendment, which he moved with great clarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>432</span>
I have three small difficulties with my hon. Friend's proposal. First, it is not absolutely clear that there is a problem, especially if one considers the additional support that will be given to venture capital financing through the measures in the Bill. Secondly, the range of companies proposed to be excluded from clause 77 includes many well-established companies that do not have a great need for the structured financing advocated by my hon. Friend. Those companies would, however, take advantage of any available tax break. The VCT rules demonstrate our preference for a more targeted approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the amendment, drawn up with my hon. Friend's characteristic generosity, goes too wide. It would accommodate lending with more of the distinctive characteristics of venture capital finance to borrowers who are far distant from the venture capital industry's distinctive clientele. For example, the amendment would cover lending to a 50:50 joint venture between two substantial quoted multinational companies on straightforward LIBOR-linked terms. It would be more comfortable if any change were clearly directed at genuine venture capital finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I cannot accept my hon. Friend's amendment, I would be happy to consider the issue further, without commitment, if he can satisfy me on those three difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for that undertaking. I accept his comment that my amendment goes too far. I hope that I shall be able to convince him during the next few weeks that there is a genuine need for an accommodation to be made because that sort of security is a valuable instrument in the funding of venture capital. It provides cashflow advantages for newly emerging companies. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
