</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Schedule 3 concerns the pensions arrangements for successor companies. Those arrangements are detailed, and the amendments reflect that. You have rightly divided the amendments into three groups, Mr. Hill. Each group refers to a different principle in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would allow employees to remain in their current pension schemes, irrespective of what happens once companies are split up and sold off. The provisions in the amendments are similar to those that were made for the employees of Amersham International when it was sold in 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments refer to existing employees who have accrued pension rights under the Atomic Energy Authority scheme. They would allow divested employees to remain in the scheme and would permit transfer back into it. The amendments would allow all employees to be treated fairly and flexibly, and that should be the objective of any scheme the Government set up. Employees should not be disadvantaged by such schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 44 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) (a) No person who, in consequence of a transfer of an undertaking other than by way of a transfer scheme ceases to be an employee of the Authority (in this paragraph referred to as a "divested employee") and who immediately before ceasing to be an employee of the Authority is a participant in an Authority pension scheme, shall cease to be a participant in that scheme by reason only that he has ceased to be employed by the Authority.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) No divested employee who immediately before ceasing to be an employee of the Authority, is not a participant in such a pension scheme, but—
	<ol>
	<li>is eligible to become such a participant, or</li>
	<li>would have been eligible to become such a participant on attaining an age or fulfilling a condition specified in the scheme, </li></ol>
shall be precluded from being or, as the case requires, becoming eligible for participation in that scheme by reason only that he has ceased to be employed by the Authority.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(5A) Sub-paragraph (4A) above shall have effect for transfers of undertakings occurring on or after 1st March 1995.'.</p></blockquote>
I hope that is clear. It is certainly as clear as any of the existing provisions in the schedule. I confess that my eyes glaze over when I read documents written in such excruciating detail. It is essential, however, that such provisions are worded accurately because of their legal implications—even if they are not entirely clear as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No transfer scheme should just be a matter of saving money. The provisions in the amendments would reduce the short-term costs of restructuring. No reference is made in the Bill to the cost to the Government of a transfer of pension undertakings as a consequence of these proposals. Given that there are 4,000 employees, there is no doubt in my mind that if an accurate actuarial costing of the scheme were undertaken, it would show a cost greatly in excess of any moneys that are likely to be realised from selling off the companies. To seek to encourage greater costs is a strange way for the Government to proceed. Deferred costs
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
of allowing employees to remain in the scheme would ultimately have to be met, but at least that would hopefully be put off to a better day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trade unions representing employees have expressed concern about some of the Bill's provisions and the actuarial assessment of the comparability of pension schemes. The Government propose that pension schemes should be broadly comparable. The Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists, in a note on the subject, refers to the recent disposal
	<br><blockquote><p>"of two groups of employees to the private sector by sale. These are Facilities Services Division with 950 employees to Procord Limited and Harwell Dosimeters with 7 employees to EMS Medical Limited. Employees in both groups were not allowed to remain in the UKAEA index linked pension schemes. Neither of the new schemes on offer from the new employers offered full index linking but both had been given the Government Actuary's Department certificate of 'broad comparability'.</p></blockquote>
The union sought independent actuarial advice from Union Pension Services Ltd, which concluded that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the scheme offered in the Dosimeters disposal 'is not broadly comparable'"—</p></blockquote>
which would appear to conflict with the GAD certificate granted to the schemes. It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Independent actuarial advice from the same source indicates that the FSD scheme"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the facility services division—
	<br><blockquote><p>"would be 'broadly comparable' provided that certain assumptions about inflation were met. However it follows that if inflation were higher during the pensioner's lifetime the FSD scheme would not be 'broadly comparable'."</p></blockquote>
The IPMS adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The fact that GAD can declare that schemes which do not have full index linking are 'broadly comparable' with UKAEA schemes that do, is a matter of great concern… It is equally alarming that UKAEA are now offering a pension scheme for one disposal"</p></blockquote>
that is considered by independent advice to be not broadly comparable. The institution continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If this is happening now we can expect a similar approach from the Treasury to disposals constructed through schemes as defined in the current AEA Bill before Parliament. They will seek to minimise the transfer-in cost to new schemes and so worsen the benefits."</p></blockquote>
In summary, we believe that the scheme should be flexible, but should allow employees, many of whom have accrued a large number of years of service to the Government in the AEA, to retain pension benefits, which, as far as they are concerned, are a legitimate part of their package of employment. It is disgraceful that the Department is now considering removing those benefits from members of staff who have given years of loyal
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
service. Hence, we tabled amendments that seek to restructure the schedule in such a way that fairness and full comparability is retained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In earlier debates Conservative Members have made taunts about our lack of experience in running businesses. Equally, we taunted Government Members about their lack of understanding of the management of any science-based organisation. In these clauses, I draw on my previous experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last task that I undertook for my previous employer was to lead on behalf of several thousand pension fund members in the largest case that went before the Chancery Division in 1991. That did not necessarily endear me to Lord Weinstock—who was down the Corridor—because the issue was of the pension implications of the merger between GEC and Plessey. In preparation for that case, I examined several pension issues, some of which I have raised on the Floor of House. Others will be the subject of later deliberations in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first matter we must consider—the Minister will speed up our progress today if he gives us specific answers to our questions—is raised at column 750 of 	<i>Hansard</i> for 10 February 1981, which refers to the Atomic Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill of that year. The then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy, the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Thames (Mr. Lamont), touched on pensions in a paragraph at the end of his speech:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is one final and important matter that I wish to make clear. The Government have decided that employees at present with TRC may remain in the Atomic Energy Authority pension scheme in which they are now members."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 10 February 1981; Vol. 998, c. 750.]</p></blockquote>
That was the Government's decision then, and there has been no fundamental change in pension legislation since that could have altered the legislative basis on which it was taken. The issue is of the Government's choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have since been a number of privatisations, for which the rules were changed. Interestingly, paragraph 5.16 on page 25 of the "Government Guide to Market Testing"—otherwise know as the Government guide to selling off the family silver—refers to pensions:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Civil servants whose jobs transfer under TUPE cannot continue to belong to the PCSPS."</p></blockquote>
That is interesting, because it is a statement of Government policy and has no legislative authority. Civil servants could belong to that scheme, or in this case, to the Atomic Energy Authority scheme, which operates on a pay-as-you-go basis. I will comment on contingent liabilities shortly, but the statement that I just read has no authority in law; Government's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5.17 continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Their accrued pension rights are fully protected by social security
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
legislation and they have the option of preserving them in the PCSPS for payment at age 60 (provided they have two or more years qualifying service), or transferring them to the new employer's pension scheme or to a personal pension arrangement. In the latter two cases a transfer value will be paid by PCSPS."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 5.17, under the heading of transfer values, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where large numbers of staff are transferring out of the PCSPC to a new employer's pension scheme a bulk transfer payment may be available. This simplifies the administrative procedures but does not change the options available to staff. Under bulk transfer arrangements, the amount of transfer value payable will be determined by the Treasury and will reflect the value of the future liabilities being shed by the PCSPS."</p></blockquote>
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it extraordinary that in this Bill, which seeks to democratise pension schemes and will appear in another place shortly after the Easter break, the Government are saying that the contingent liabilities fund—and therefore the transfer value—will be determined by the Treasury. At the very least, the Government should guarantee that such sums of money will be subject to testing by independent actuaries who have nothing to do with the Government. That is a matter of principle to which the Government should accede, irrespective of the outcome of our debates on these clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of what are the contingent liabilities. Under customary actuarial principles, they are either the sums necessary to protect all fund members if the fund were to collapse at an early stage as a result of the company going into liquidation or they may be the contingent liabilities carried forward for years into the future, to ensure that any individual receives his or her just deserts from the fund. Depending on the age profile of membership, that provides a wide range of possible figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, the age profile of the existing membership is known and the fund liabilities are known. It would therefore be appropriate for the Minister to tell the Committee precisely what the contingent liabilities are as of today. If he cannot do so, that will put the Committee in serious difficulties. Without that information, the Committee will be taking a stab in the dark—protecting the interests of neither fund members nor taxpayers in our decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, unless the Government spell out exactly what are the liabilities, no potential purchaser of the company can put a serious value on the company. In the case of Amersham International in 1981, the Under-Secretary of State for Energy said that the Government would continue to carry those liabilities. If it is the Government's intention, in privatising this company, to gain the best value for money for the taxpayer and if they have no satisfactory explanation for the change since 1981, it becomes impossible to justify how they are presenting the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The value of the company will be reduced as a function of the contingent liabilities. If the Government want the
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
highest possible price for the company, logically they should operate under the 1981 principle that applied to Amersham International. Given that this is a pay-as-you-go scheme, the liabilities are notional—the word "notional" appears in the Government's text in several other sectors—and they will, presumably, have an impact on the Treasury's definition of the public sector borrowing requirement. They are notional liabilities, not absolute. Unless the company collapsed, the worst case that generates the highest definition of contingent liabilities—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Industry and Energy (Mr. Richard Page)</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister doubts me, but I assure him that I am right. The worst-case example of contingent liabilities, depending on the age profile, would probably be the collapse of the company. They would be protected inside the PSBR but, given the Government's confidence that the business will succeed, they would never have to pay out. The only affected figure would be the notional impact on the PSBR. As a result, the Government will get a higher price for the company. That seems illogical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister still doubts me, but he must understand that pension liabilities and pension assets can count towards a company's assets or liabilities. I hope that he understands. Perhaps he can explain the Government's attitude. Against that background, it is clearly in the Government's best interest in terms of actual commitment—real money that they would have to pay out—to maintain the responsibility for those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier debate, the Government made it clear that in Amersham International, the majority of employees are in the company's own scheme. That makes sense—of course, they would be, because at the time of the Amersham sale, people in the work place were not certain what would happen to the company, so took the prudent decision to stay with the safe public sector scheme. They had no idea at that time whether the new company would create an attractive pension fund. There will be two groups of people—those who at the point of vesting had the decision of whether to (transfer and new employees who started after vesting day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not arguing that new employees should not join the new scheme and neither are we arguing that individuals should not have the choice to transfer from one scheme to another. The decision should be theirs. That is what normally happens in company takeovers. It is rare for a company taking over another to say, "You must transfer." It is easy for the new company to make it more attractive for people to exercise their right to transfer, but it is rare for it to wind up the scheme, because of the impact on the company's rights of ownership of any surplus that exists if it chooses to wind up the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our model, the new group of people would have the choice, post-privatisation, of remaining in the scheme if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
they were existing AEA employees; they would also have the choice of transferring to the new private sector fund if it were actuarially to their advantage. That is what freedom of choice is all about—the Government keep telling us they believe in that, so let there be real freedom of choice in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As time goes by, the next generation of employees will all be in the new arrangement so, on a transitional basis, the Government would carry the notional liability inside PSBR that would pay out on a pay-as-you-go basis in the normal pattern of retirements and deaths in service, but not any large capital expenditure in any given year—unless the worst case happened and there were an enormous call on the fund because of a huge industrial accident, for example, leading to many deaths in service. However, that is a highly improbable eventuality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under our model, therefore, the Government would have the best deal, both in terms of cash flow and of the potential benefits from the sale of the company. It is important that the Government explain themselves. I do not understand why they made the change, for which there is no legislative basis, it does not provide the greatest freedom of choice for individuals and it is not in the financial interests of taxpayers. I hope that the Government will help us to develop our debate. If they can respond on those three specific points we might make progress. If they cannot do that, the most we can do is urge members of the Committee to support our amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Purchase 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wolverhampton, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer to my hon. Friend's description of the problem that faces us—it does, however, face us because of hurried nature of the privatising of AEA Technology. We are again short of arithmetic analysis, simply because there has not been time to make things clear to the employees of the company, who will be affected by whatever measures are taken. We disagree with the Government's intention to privatise the industry, but if the Bill had been given more and proper time, there may have been more detailed discussions with employees or their representatives about the future of pensions. Unfortunately, more and more people have to rely on occasionally capricious market forces determining the pension that they ultimately receive. Guarantees are given, but we have seen unfortunate incidents in recent years where guarantees were absolutely worthless. Other practices should have been discussed and made clear before the Bill came to the House—such as contribution holidays, which are popular with some employers. Who knows what future arrangements might be made if the company is taken over by foreign interests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Purchase</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share your anxiety, Mr. Hill, which was so clearly expressed on your otherwise fair countenance. That is more than a fleeting possibility. The question of pensions will be discussed, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) said, not long after Easter, when the Bill returns from another place. In the meantime, the Minister should try to
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
advance a case for not allowing employees to remain indefinitely in the existing pension fund or to rejoin it, thus rebutting the amendments from my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy, which make it clear that employees should be allowed to remain in the existing pension fund and to rejoin it when they think necessary or fit. Guarantees from the Minister that employees would be allowed that choice would go some way towards quelling Opposition fears for the future of the company's employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was mentioned that that provision was extended to the employees of Amersham International. Even though its employees now are in the Amersham scheme, the safety and security that they felt at the time of the transfer no doubt was an important part of the company's general success. We applaud that. There is no question but that the performance at work of people who are worried about their present or future security suffers. It is vital that the Minister is able to reassure AEA Technology's employees in that regard.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concurrently with the passage of the Bill, the Minister ought to talk directly to the company to establish the employees' feelings. My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston has great experience of pension fund negotiations. He set out clearly some of the problems that arise. Some years ago, I was the chairman of a modest pension fund, and later I was part of one of the country's largest pension funds. I learnt that difficulties can emerge when people transfer out of and then return to pension schemes. It is very difficult to satisfy all possibilities in one scheme unless one has detailed knowledge of the circumstances that can arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that all such circumstances have been explored. That is a result of the rushed nature of the Bill. I regret that, unless the Minister can give the guarantees to which the employees are entitled, there may well be further rumblings on this matter in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to emphasise that, in debates on the Floor of the House and in Committee so far, the Government appear to have treated the Bill as a generalised enabling measure. They want privatisation, but are unwilling to spell out how they want it accomplished. The Bill does not make clear whether the sell-off will be as a whole or in bits and pieces, but at this stage the pension rights of the 4,000 employees involved should be spelt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may respond by pointing to page 22 of the Bill, where, under schedule 3, the powers of the Secretary of State are listed. But too often Committees like this pass Bills containing a generalised power for the Secretary of State to act at a later date. Paragraph 3 of schedule 3 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may direct the Authority to make such amendments of any Authority pension scheme as may be specified in the direction for any of the following purposes … for requiring or enabling funds to be transferred under an Authority scheme in cases where, by virtue of paragraph 2(4) above … persons cease to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
included in an Authority pension scheme … and for prescribing the method of calculating the amounts to be transferred and the assumptions to be used in calculating those amounts".</p></blockquote>
In other words, the Secretary of State will have the power to bring about the very measure that we are proposing. All that we are suggesting is to insert amendment No. 44 in the space between schedule 3(2) and the title of schedule 3(3). That would make it plain to everybody—not just to us in Committee and to Parliament but to every single employee—that all workers will be allowed to opt back in, rejoin or remain in the scheme after their employment has been transferred elsewhere. That should be stated clearly in the Bill, not left for the Secretary of State to return to later. Guarantees should be built into the Bill, not left to the whim of the Secretary of State to unpack after our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not proposing a cast-iron, fixed view but merely asking for options. The amendment should be readily accepted by Conservative Members as a means of protecting people's pension schemes. We are defining the brackets within which the Secretary of State's powers should apply. I hope that the Minister agrees that it is not always good for legislation to confer more and more powers indiscriminately on the Secretary of State. We should be as clear and unambiguous as possible, which is why amendment No. 44 is so valuable in spelling out pension rights. I hope that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the amendments tabled by Opposition Members, but I make it clear from the start that I shall not accept them. The amendments provide the opportunity to debate and to place on record important concerns and equally relevant responses, which will go a long way to reassure people involved with AEA Technology that the Government are dealing seriously with pension transfer and seeking to provide adequate safeguards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As explained by the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy, the amendments would allow employees who cease to be employees of the authority—whether transferred to a successor company or part of a divestment by the authority—to continue to participate in authority pension schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the spirit behind the remarks of the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle). It is vital to make it as clear as possible that adequate protections exist for employees and that their valuable pension rights are not at risk through the whim of the system. I appreciate the concern to allow employees to remain in the authority's pension scheme. Equally, however, they will know that the Government's policy is not to allow that to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will hold on, I shall explain why in a minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been standard practice in transfers of employees from the public service, whether in privatisations or on
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
contracting out, to end public service scheme membership on the move to the private sector. That practice has been followed consistently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy raised a number of points. He mentioned the Government Actuary and the issue of independence. It should be placed on record that the Government Actuary Department provides an independent opinion and is not influenced by the Government or the authority. Proof of the pudding has been in the eating. This is not the first privatisation. Several transfers of employment to the private sector have taken place, and the Government Actuary's opinion has been regarded as authoritative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To put the record straight, we do not question the Government Actuary's impartiality but its competence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says and re-emphasise that the proof of the pudding has been in the eating. The competence of the Government Actuary's Department has not been called into question, and I have no reason to believe that it will be in this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will explain why there are different rules for the private sector. When I transferred my sole employment to this place, I had been in a pension fund for some years. It was subject to calculation of the transfer value by the scheme's actuaries—the parallel here would be Government Actuaries. The transfer value was, however, subject to independent assessment before the transfer came about. Why cannot the same principle apply to civil servants? Are not the Government applying rules to civil servants that are less favourable than those they require organisations in the outside world to follow?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would be in danger of moving on to the next group of amendments if I were to give a full answer. The matter is quite simple. The Government Actuary division gives an independent opinion. If individuals do their own calculations and are unhappy with that decision, they will be able to stay in the existing scheme and keep their accrued rights until they move. If they move to the new scheme, they would start with a lower base because no transfer value would pertain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister understand that two halves do not make a whole in pension funds? It would be to employees' disadvantage to exercise the combined option. Schemes that are built up on years of service for the Government and then years of service for a privatised AEA Technology will not benefit people. They must be in one scheme or the other. They must be able to determine the date of transfer themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the choice exists, people will be able to decide whether it would be to their advantage to transfer. It is not for me to guide employees—they can move to the other system if they want. Opposition Members' concerns only arise because they query the Government Actuary's independence. Experience shows, however, that there is no need to do so.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
We might have to agree to disagree on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member's comments on Government liabilities and the transfer of costs from one part of Government to another were interesting but erroneous. The transfer of accrued pension liability from one part to another should be neutral. The liability is retained and built up, and it will have to be transferred to the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister must address the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. The hon. Member and I were engaging in a personal discussion almost to the exclusion of other members of the Committee: We will deal with this issue in more detail in the next group of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy asked about the amounts involved in a transfer of accrued pension rights. I can only refer him to the Financial and Explanatory Memorandum, which suggests figures between £120 million and £160 million. The amount of money will depend, however, on the number of people wishing to transfer. The hon. Gentleman referred to Amersham International. That company was the exception and the Government have been blunt about the fact that that method will not be repeated. I make no apology for that. We have come a long way since the legislation affecting the Amersham International employees was passed some 24 years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify what he said about employees electing to transfer? There is no question of election in this matter. When a company goes into the private sector, its employees are forced to move along with it. End of story.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. I was referring to employees' accrued pension rights. They can decide whether to leave them in the authority's present scheme or to take the money and move into the private scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister understand the difference between past service liability and future service? He has spoken only about employees' rights in the context of past service liability. We want to establish a principle that allows employees to continue their contributions into the public service scheme so that they can operate their personal choice to their best advantage. When they should transfer would then depend on age and health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Gentleman means, as I have all along, but, as I have said, It is not Government policy to go down that route—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—because it is better that the employees and the companies into which they move have complete control
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
over how pension schemes can be tailored in the future. In a moment I shall speak about our mission, about which the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy asked: it is to show that pension scheme members, when given the choice, choose to have that control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not intend to repeat the Amersham method of about 14 years ago. Rather than wait for a scheme to be devised for AEA Technology employees, the Government want to ensure that a scheme exists at the outset for them to join. Amersham International staff were able to stay in the authority's scheme until an equivalent scheme was available and the Secretary of State made an order removing them from the authority scheme. We are ensuring that an equivalent scheme is available straight away for AEA Technology staff. They will thus enjoy a certainty denied to Amersham International staff, who had the uncertainty of not knowing whether they would be allowed to continue in the authority scheme or whether they would be removed from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Bill has gone through and the publicly owned companies are set up an then transferred to the private sector, TUPE regulations will be in force for a limited period. What happens when an employee is made redundant in that period? Does that employee retain his or her existing pension rights, or lose them? Normally, when an employee is made redundant after being in service for a sufficient time, the pension benefits accrued under the scheme to which that employee belonged while in employment are retained. What would happen under the TUPE regulations in such a case? Would not a person made redundant after privatisation be in a more favourable position than someone who moves to the new company?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I can see, there is no reason why those rights should not be retained and protected. I do not see why a person in that position should lose out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the 1971 Act, the Amersham International employees had no specific right to be consulted on the provision of the pension which that company now provides. By contrast, we are including in the Bill a right for employee representatives to be consulted on the private sector scheme which employees will be allowed to join.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth repeating that when the Amersham International staff were given the opportunity to choose which scheme to go for, more than 90 per cent. opted to enter the private scheme. I think that is fair to say that the majority of the 10 per cent. who were left over were near retirement and did not consider it worth while to change to the company scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. The change was made through virtue of personal choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me postulate an example: an existing employee knows that he is suffering from a terminal illness and the death-in-service provisions of the new scheme are less favourable than the existing scheme. It is no good the Minister saying that there are guarantees against that, because the Bill does not provide such a guarantee; it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
guarantees that the global package of employment conditions should be broadly similar. If the death-in-service provisions were not at the same level, one can understand why an employee would not transfer. Does the Minister think that the formula should guarantee freedom of choice to protect the individual?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to pre-empt what a pension package might be, but there is a growing tendency for personalised pension packages, about which I happen to know a little bit, where the individual can choose what death-in-service multiples to have and how much may be accruable to the widow—that can relate to the amount that would then go into the person's pension. The term is like self-selections in a cafeteria.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my example, the person would not be eligible, on a reasonable financial basis, to purchase a personal package. The person has an insurance scheme based on the Government's scheme and that is transferable only to another occupational scheme. If the transfer offered a worse provision, that person and his beneficiaries would be materially worse off. The private pension scheme which may be appropriate for some is not a possibility in my example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman produces, dare I say it—I hope that it is not a fact—a hypothetical situation and the best that I can do is to examine it and return to the Committee. Perhaps the issue could be reconsidered on Report so that I can give a more detailed response. It would be wrong of me to suggest how the idea might work without examining it more closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Amersham International, 90 per cent. of employees made the choice to move to the new scheme. It is worth pointing out that the Amersham scheme does not give full index linking above about 7.5 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policy is clear: we do not believe that it would be appropriate to allow private sector employees to remain as members of a pension scheme set up for employees of the authority. The authority has devised its public sector service schemes to provide what it considers to be appropriate pensions for its employees and it is for the private sector employer to develop arrangements appropriate to its employees and to the operation of its business. I therefore, urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed with the Minister's reply to the reasonable points that we made. An important matter of principle is at stake when the Government talk about matters being broadly comparable and when remarks are made about the transfer being neutral. In other words, in theory, the value transferred to successor companies will be exactly the same as the amount that the Government would have paid out anyway under the old scheme. In such circumstances, there can be no objection to employees electing to stay in the state scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the provision is neutral, it is neutral. People should be allowed to make a personal decision as to whether they
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
remain in the UKAEA scheme or transfer to the other scheme. We all know fine, however, that the proposal is not neutral; it is larceny on a grand scale. The Government are stealing accrued rights from people who may have served the authority for 30 years. When those people transfer to the private sector, they will lose their benefits. Okay, they will be transferred, and some pension package will be got up which put a bold enough skin on the arrangement for the Government to claim that it is equivalent to the existing scheme. If it is equivalent, the employees should be able to stay in their original scheme. We do not accept the Minister's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would protect the value to employees of the pensions that are provided by successor companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment Nos. 47, 52 and 58 relate to the transfer value of the pensions, with the result that one year under the AEA scheme would transfer to the new scheme as one year of service. It would therefore be a one-to-one arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment Nos. 50, 51, 56 and 57 relate to the value of the benefits in the new scheme and would require the new pension schemes to provide like-for-like benefits. That would rule out of order any other, non-pension benefits which the new employers might provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with the detailed value of the scheme in order to protect the pensions. As we all know, the pension fund is currently performing well and offers good benefits; we want to ensure that it is carried forward for employees. It is crucial that there is no ambiguity about their rights to proper protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the fund will perform much better, but that hinges on the definition of broad comparability used by the Government Actuary's Department; that is the crucial issue. We need to be clear about that definition, because it will be used for the disposals. We do not want merely to create space in the future, either for inflation-capping pensions or for the offer of contributions, holidays and the rest; they have proved to be daylight robbery and have reduced the value of pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is in the definition of broad comparability; I want to focus on the GAD's rather ambiguous definition because it is incumbent on us to spell that out and on the Minister to make the Government's position plain. The GAD does not provide much detail in its certificate of broad comparability about its approach but it provided UKAEA with a note, on 27 March, in which it outlined its approach to judging the comparability of UKAEA pension schemes with other schemes. It said that it would apply three clear criteria. I wish to focus on those, particularly the first, about which the GAD said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schemes will meet the criterion of broad comparability only if the assessed employer contribution rate in the new scheme is at least equal to that in the old scheme across the whole range of the transferring membership, taking into account the specific characteristics of that membership".</p></blockquote>
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the GAD's conclusion, it is evident that that one criteria dominates throughout. The assessed employer contribution is the estimated cost to the employer of providing the benefits of the scheme less the value of
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
employee contributions. That is expressed as an estimated annual employer contribution required through the future careers of employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The GAD also states that the assessed employee contribution rate must depend on
	<br><blockquote><p>"a consistent set of assumptions which represent a considered view of likely future long term average experience, taking into account past experience… It is important in assessing comparability that the assumptions adopted minimise the extent of any possible bias in the comparison."</p></blockquote>
I have read out that note because it raises an essential question: what assumption has the GAD used in the comparison of the two schemes? Obviously, it would make a considerable difference to such a comparison if, for example, it were assumed that inflation remained below 5 per cent. for a pensioner's lifetime. Such a view would not represent a
	<br><blockquote><p>"a considered view of likely future long term average experience, taking into account past experience"</p></blockquote>
but would be biased in favour of schemes in which index linking is capped. It is unclear what impact a previous or existing employer taking or having recently taken a contributions holiday would have on the comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a real possibility that any non-index-linked pension scheme will be judged broadly comparable with a scheme such as that run by UKAEA, which has relatively high employee contribution rates and a fund that is performing well, with consequent downward pressure on the level of employers' contributions. When we examine the detail of the value of benefits to members in such a comparison, the comparison becomes almost irrelevant. In other words, it is an open door policy for allowing the scheme to be run down. I want some reassurance from the Minister that that will not happen. The second criterion set in the GAD note is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Schemes will have to offer a full range of benefits covering all the major contingencies covered by UKAEA schemes."</p></blockquote>
It says of the third criterion:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although there is not a requirement that benefits are replicated exactly in the new scheme, any detriment in a particular area must be compensated elsewhere in the overall arrangement… overall, there is no significant detriment to any identifiable individual or groups of individuals within the body of staff being transferred".</p></blockquote>
It is extremely difficult to see how the GAD squares schemes with historically low index linking caps, such as 5 per cent., with that criterion. The union's pension services review of the FSD scheme states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the main losers will be those pensioners who live through periods of high inflation, where their benefits will fall to increase by as much as they would have done in the UKAEA schemes."</p></blockquote>
It is not appropriate for us to go through the history of inflation. It may be argued that the Government anti-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
inflation policy has been working for the past couple of years, but even that is speculative given recent remarks. We must allow for the working life of a scheme when making inflation assessments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want clarification of the process that the Government Actuary Department—or, indeed, the Government—will use to check that the two schemes are "broadly comparable". It is essential that term is not used as a cloak to hide future devaluation of schemes so that people lose out. The schedule says that the Government Actuary's Department should rule on whether the benefits conferred
	<br><blockquote><p>"are no less favourable than the benefits conferred by the provisions … of the Authority pension scheme".</p></blockquote>
What does that mean? If the GAD is to be asked to rule on that, we must be clear about the definition of broad comparability. At present it is ambiguous and could hide a reduction in value. I hope that is not the Minister's intention. It may be, but I will not attribute to him such cynical motives. He said that he wanted it to be a better scheme that will increase in value. If so, it is incumbent on the Government to confirm that our worst fears will not be realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister reassure me that in the review of comparability, the criteria will be properly applied? We must have greater openness, scrutiny, public accountability and proper auditing before we transfer schemes without knowing the financial details and the amounts that people will receive in the long term. That is not clear at present and the definition of broad comparability must be unambiguous. People must not have their contributions taken away and their benefits reduced. The Minister should spell out exactly what is meant by the criteria—and guarantee that people will not be worse off because the value of their pensions, for which they have paid, has been reduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In our earlier debate I posed three questions that the Minister was unable to answer. However, after I cited an individual case, he accepted that pension funds are required to meet the needs of individuals. I am grateful to him for agreeing to return to that point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister accepted my hon. Friend's amendments, he would go part of the way to dealing with the difficulty. When one fund merges with another, there is a takeover or, as in this case, a sale of the company, one of the most important benefits that needs to be transferred is the pension fund. The tidiest way is to guarantee that the fund is identical, especially if it is a high-quality scheme. That prevents people worrying when their lives are disrupted by the apparent uncertainty of the privatisation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not accede to our view that people should be able to remain in the civil service scheme, an alternative approach would be to ensure that benefit-for-benefit, year-for-year transfers are arranged so that people continue in an identical scheme. That would avoid having two schemes where the overall value of the scheme is
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
actuarially calculated as being identical but individual benefits within it are quite different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, in scheme one, death in service could be two years, but only one year in scheme two. There would have to be counterbalancing benefits. For example, in scheme one, the definition of normal retirement could be from age 65, but from 60 in scheme two. By definition, that would disadvantage the person in the hypothetical case that I mentioned earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that I was grasping at straws and creating unreal argument. Actuarially, it is bound to be real. There is bound to be someone in the population who fits that scenario. My hon. Friend's notion that transfer should be year for year, benefit for benefit, would ensure that these fears will not translate into reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some pension fund transfers have been controversial. The cause célèbre was that involving Hanson Trust and Imperial Tobacco. That interesting court case hinged on the definition of who were the beneficiaries. Lord Hanson regarded himself as a beneficiary and wanted to cream off the surpluses of Imperial Tobacco's schemes as part of the takeovers. Clearly, we are not in that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the definitions are set out precisely in the Bill, it would not be unreasonable for employees to fear that—because the change from 1981 to today is a matter of policy rather than legislation—something like that could happen. If the Government will not explain why the scheme should operate one way rather than another, it is not unreasonable for employees to fear that they may not ge a fair deal. If the Government are not prepared to put the calculation of contingent liabilities and transfer values out to an independent actuary, if it will be done in-house and if they will not guarantee that people will be placed in an identical scheme, how can employees know that they will not be placed in the same position as those of Imperial Tobacco—clearly disadvantaged as a result of a change of ownership?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my first Session in this place, I was fortunate enough to win the ballot for a private Member's Bill, which was on the same theme of the effect on pensions of takeovers and change of ownership. I was given guarantees by the present Under-Secretary of State for Employment that the issues that I raised would be referred to the inquiry conducted by Professor Goode. Regrettably, that did not result in any substantive recommendations from him, except that I have in writing from the Government a recognition that it is a real problem and should be tackled. I shall remind the Government of that commitment when the Pensions Bill reaches the Floor of the House. This is the second change of ownership Bill in which I have participated: last year, I was a member of the Committee that considered the legislation setting up Milk Marque, and the principles involved are the same. The Government must be seen not to disadvantage employees individually or collectively. In the absence of a reversion to the Amersham principle the Minister must guarantee that, benefit for benefit, year for year, transfers will take place on the basis of absolute equity.

I shall continue to press the Minister on my first three questions, which have not been answered. I hope that he will accept the amendments and so lay to rest most of my fears about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Purchase</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, we are seeing far too many variables and insufficient constants in relation to pensions. There are too many generalisations and not enough particulars. The Government's commitment to privatisation leads them into circumstances in which strategy and details are not worked out properly and reliably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent years, pension funds and their management have provided the opportunity for so many scams that no one can feel safe. The only possible exceptions are public servants. Traditionally—or at least until recently—there has been a balancing act between the relatively low pay in the public services and the relatively high level of security that that employment offers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Almost every day, we encounter new revelations about the pay and pension packages of the chief executives and directors of the privatised utilities. When we compare those packages with the figures for what might be termed the traditional private sector, we find that traditional private sector pay levels for enterprises of about the same size are roughly one and a half times even the immense salaries enjoyed by those employed in the privatised utilities. A driving force behind the hike in salaries—they are usually linked to short-term contracts of one, two or three years—is the pressure to raise the benefit to be derived from the pension contribution paid as part of the package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy said, some of the staff affected by the Bill have worked for the company for 30 years. They have never worried for a moment about the pension that they would receive on retirement. They took it as read. The figure was a constant, a particular rather than a generalisation. They understood their pensions to be secure. They knew what they could look forward to, and they could ask the personnel department about what their pension entitlement would be if they left before retirement, or about what it would be when it matured. They could get sensible answers, about which they could make sensible choices, if they so desired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The managers of pension funds appear to be driven by different forces now. The Bill ought to contain more detail about what people can expect either when they retire or if they leave before their pension entitlement is fully matured. They are entitled to such information. The generalities expressed in the Bill will not allow anybody to be clear about their entitlement, at least in the early days of the transfer. That brings us to the issue of the competence or impartiality of the assessment—the actuarial value of the pension fund—at the point of transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it is allegedly a science to determine the value of a pension fund, we inevitably find that there is an
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
element of judgment and of discretion in determining the values and liabilities of that fund. That is what my colleagues expressed concern about. They want an alternative method of measuring the value, perhaps by an independent actuary not of the Government's making. They want that alternative because the fund deals with 4,000 employees. That is extremely large and the opportunity to undervalue that scheme on transfer is considerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to cast doubt on anybody's integrity. I do not even need to say that anyone is competent or incompetent, partial or impartial. I am merely saying that one opinion on the subject might lead to at least part of the worker's entitlement being cream-skimmed back into the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind hon. Members of the arguments about the British Rail pension fund and about the valuations of all the privatisations. It was afeared that the Government were quite intent on taking part of the total value of the pension fund for themselves on the legal basis—they claimed—that as the contributions were made on a proportionality basis, they were entitled to it. We have never supported that principle, and we do not believe that it is fair or that a contribution is paid merely as part of deferred wages. The full value of a pension fund, whatever it is, should accrue entirely to the workers and employees concerned. That is what we are trying to achieve today. Several measures are needed and they have been spelt out by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the Government have a driving commitment to privatisation. We know that they believe that matters are managed better in the private than in the public sector. We do not share that view. In fact, we are able to demonstrate that AEA has been successfully managed for more than 41 years—the management started on 1 August 1954 and has provided full index linking for its members. We want that to be continued. At Amersham International, the scheme was fully indexed up to 8 per cent., I think, and, thereafter, at half the additional rate of inflation. Even that could be improved on. People who have deferred considerable wages as public employees are fully entitled to get the absolute benefit from the contributions that they have made and from that part of the deferred wages which the employers tended to call their contribution to the pension fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The motives for the Bill are clear: they are to do with the Government's determination to privatise wherever they can as quickly as they can. An assurance should be included in the Bill to give far more certainty about the value of the fund. We need assurances that the Government are prepared to concede a second valuation of the fund to avoid the uncertainties and the difficulties that emerged in previous cases. We want the full value transferred to a new fund so that the workers who pay into it are entitled to their just rewards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The combination of haste, ideological commitment and lack of detail in the provisions is a fatal combination and will not reassure workers. We need that reassurance—the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
Government must be fair and must be seen to be fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends have made most of the points that needed to be made. It is important that we protect the value of pensions completely during transfer to the private sector. The Bill would not do that, and escape clauses have been built into it to ensure that protection is not guaranteed. The amendments would remove those escape clauses and ensure that actuarial value was maintained in the successor companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill makes it clear that
	<br><blockquote><p>"employees will be entitled to exercise an option of joining another scheme whose overall provisions, in combination with other benefits arising from new conditions of employment, 'are no less favourable'".</p></blockquote>
That would encourage a new employer to base a package of terms and conditions of employment on a partial buyout of current pension entitlement and to offer a package that was effectively subsidised by the pension provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not allow that to happen. There is much concern about the raiding of pension funds, which the Bill would only encourage. We must ring fence pension conditions and ensure that they are carried over into arrangements in successor companies. We must not allow other conditions of employment to be balanced against the value of those pensions. That is an enticement to raid pension provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We talked about the need to protect the work force, on which the welfare of AEA Technology rests. The schedule will do nothing to reassure the work force that their pension entitlement will continue and will not be diminished, or that they will not be offered terms and conditions of employment that are subsidised by their past contributions and those of their former employers. The amendments are necessary to ensure that does not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the Committee accepts that every privatisation has its own character and that pension provisions are tailored to conform to it. The Government have designed the pension provisions they believe to be most appropriate to this privatisation. The amendments give me the opportunity to outline exactly what lies behind those provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of AEA Technology, employees who participate in an authority scheme and who transfer will be given access to a new or existing pension scheme operated by their new employer. The Bill provides the protection that the scheme must be no less favourable overall than the UKAEA scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vendor—whether it is the Secretary of State or the authority—will have a duty to be satisfied that a pension scheme exists for employees, with a right of participation in the authority schemes, and that that scheme as a whole is no less favourable than the authority schemes. Employee representatives must be consulted before the Secretary of
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
State or the authority can be satisfied that the new scheme meets those requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There appears to be no actuarial interpretation in the Bill of the phrase "no less favourable". Does not the Minister think that to reassure staff, it would be advisable for the Bill to define that phrase?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will be patient, I will touch on that point shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new scheme must offer benefits at least equivalent to the authority scheme, although the mix of benefits may be different. The Secretary of State or the authority would ask the Government Actuary, who has wide experience in these matters, to verify that the new scheme meets the requirements of the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed amendments would restrict the ability of the vendor to decide that a new scheme was comparable, when its provisions were taken as a whole. That would effectively require each benefit to be at least as good as at present, but that is not possible. Some features of the authority's scheme cannot be reproduced in a tax-exempt occupational pension scheme. The amendments would mean that the new scheme could not be tax exempt, and I do not think that employees would thank the hon. Gentleman if they had to pay tax on not only their own and their employees' pension contributions but on a lump-sum benefit paid from the scheme. I am sure that that disadvantage is unintentional, but it would nevertheless be the effect of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Minister acknowledging that it is possible for my hypothetical individual to be materially disadvantaged by the transfer? In the case that I gave, the individual needed a higher death-in-service benefit than other healthier individuals and he or she could therefore be materially disadvantaged. Is that so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, I will consider the hon. Gentleman's hypothetical example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The authority's scheme has a two year death-in-service benefit, to which the hon. Gentleman has already referred, and it might be that employees feel that is satisfactory. They may, on the other hand, feel that is unsatisfactory and want a greater death-in-service benefit. I do not know. When the employee moves into another scheme, the mix may or may not be the same. It would be up to the individual, if so inclined, to take out any comparable and balancing insurance that was necessary to cover the difference. As I said, the new scheme must be no less favourable as an overall package, but that package might confer different benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the word "mix" include non-pension benefits? That is crucial to our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that I place my words on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
record. There will then be an opportunity to examine them and to make any necessary comments, but only after members of the Committee have heard them as a piece. The current dotting in and out makes for disjointed debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members raised the issue of index linking. The Bill does not rule that out. As we heard, Amersham International has a scheme with index linking up to 7.5 per cent. and smaller incremental increases beyond that. I sincerely hope, however, that we never approach an index-linked figure of 7.5 per cent., because that would mean that inflation is returning to the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it is common for private-sector schemes to have an element of index linking—I believe that the Pensions Bill will impose some minimum requirements—it would be wrong to suggest that full index linking is a common feature of private-sector schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot say at this stage what any new employer may want to propose but whatever happens, the terms must be—I return to the phrase—no less favourable overall. In deciding whether the scheme is no less favourable, employee representatives must be consulted. I have no doubt that they will make their views known on all the features of the package. If full index linking were included in the new scheme, that would reduce the scope for increasing other benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Purchase</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the possible negotiations come to a deadlock, at whatever stage, it will be the interpretation of the Act that matters. We have made the point to the Minister time and again that the generalisations in the Bill will not sufficiently protect employees in those negotiations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to keep returning to that because I have already dealt with it. The role of the GAD is crucial. It has a well-proven record of independence and it will decide whether there is a fair balance of benefit. The hon. Gentleman does the Department a disservice by saying that it will try to make a less favourable deal for the employees. That is not the case. I go back to the phrase "no less favourable"—it is most important that the deal is seen to be a fair transfer with no less favourable terms when it is applied, as a mix, to the new pension scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing to prevent employees leaving their accrued rights in the authority scheme. The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston was dismissive about that—nevertheless, employees can choose to retain full index linking on their service. If they opt to transfer their accrued service to a new pension scheme, any pension increase provisions of the new scheme would apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also seeks to include in the Bill a requirement for the transfer value made to the new scheme to be sufficient to provide for at least a year-for-year transfer of service. When staff are transferred with their work, it is common, in both the public and private sectors, for special arrangements for the transfer of accrued rights to be made. We intend to negotiate what are known as bulk
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
transfer arrangements between the authority schemes and the new employer. Under such an arrangement, the sum transferred would be sufficient to cover the accrued rights of transferred employees, taking account of expected salary growth to retirement and index linking thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A transfer value of that kind, known as a fast service reserve, would be available only when the new scheme is prepared to offer service credits which give benefits of at least equivalent value to those in the authority scheme. However, if there were a difference in the overall value of the benefits in the new schemes compared with the old, the actual sum transferred may buy slightly fewer or slightly more years of service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whose definition of past service reserves is the Minister using? Is it the Government Actuary's definition or will there be independent advice on that calculation? If a third party identified a different figure, would the Government agree to go to an independent body, to ensure that the figures were correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The definitions are from the Government Actuary. If perceived anomalies were brought to its attention, it would give it their consideration and would investigate whether they were actual anomalies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, the sum transferred may buy slightly more or slightly less years of service but even if it were slightly less, that would not mean that employees would lose out. Because the benefits offered by the new scheme would be better overall than the authority scheme, employees would still receive benefits which, taken as a whole, would be equivalent to those of the authority scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, it is not relevant that the authority schemes only have a notional fund, nor that the notional funds have notional surpluses. Even if the notional funds were in deficit, there would still be a transfer payment based on the past service reserve method. The payment of transfer values would extinguish equivalent liability. Therefore, it is wrong to suggest that this cost should be taken into account when assessing the case for privatisation. The money would have to be paid over time anyway. In the meantime, AEA Technology, its employees and the economy as a whole would reap the benefits of privatisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, the Government Actuary would be asked to certify to the Secretary of State or to the authority that, in his view, the new scheme, taken as a whole, is no less favourable than the current one. In doing so, he may need to take into account the enhanced non-pension benefits. However, such compensatory benefits should be relatively minor compared with the benefits under the new pension scheme. The Government Actuary would not certify the scheme unless he was satisfied that that was the case. The Government Actuary's independence in the procedure must be emphasised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no threat to employees. Any changes would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
subject to negotiation, and employees would retain the protection of general employment law and pension legislation in their overall terms and conditions of employment. I hope that that explanation will reassure Opposition Members and persuade them to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was striking that the Minister responded not to the phrase "broadly comparable" but to "no less favourable". The difficulty is that both those terms sound friendly enough, but they are loose. One of them needs to be tied down in law so that employees know where they stand. There is no actuarial interpretation of the phrase "no less favourable". It is for the Secretary of State or the authority to judge what is "no less favourable". Will the Minister ask the Government Actuary to certify that the advantages that accrue to employees from a change of scheme will equal or outweigh the disadvantages? The assumptions and the methods of calculation behind that assessment must be spelt out so that people can know where they stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such transparency would help, and the amendments make it clear how that transparency could be achieved—the basis of any transfer should be one for one, like for like. It is not a lot to ask that such a basis be accepted. The Minister cannot simply suggest that the term "no less favourable" already exists and so can be judged by the Secretary of State, with the Government Actuary available to provide advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister think differently?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot let the hon. Gentleman get away with muddling the roles of the Secretary of State and the Government Actuary. The Government Actuary's Department will produce the calculations on the pension scheme to ensure that it is "no less favourable". Those are the figures that will be used. The Secretary of State will not advise or guide on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister accuses me of blurring terms, but that reply was the most blurred of all. He is not clear about whether the scheme will be beneficial to the employees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon.

Friend agree that the only way to guarantee equity on such matters is to ensure that they are open to independent scrutiny?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. It is often assumed that experience rests on one side of the Committee rather than on the other. There is experience on both sides of dealing with pensions, not least of negotiating the rights of pensioners in the transfer of schemes—my colleagues have long experience of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is incumbent on us to spell out that we understand what is happening and that we know the implications. One of our top priorities should be to protect employees and to protect their pension schemes, not simply in the present; we should let them know where those schemes are going and where they can be expected to go. We have seen enough problems with failed pension schemes in recent years. The whole purpose of a pension scheme is to offer social security in retirement and if people cannot depend on it, that is the worst of all worlds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister accused me of blurring the issue but there is space in law to make it clear. If the Government Actuary's phrase used in his certification is "broadly comparable", we should be clear what the phrase means. I see no reason why the actuary could not be asked to certify that the advantages that arise from the change of the scheme will be equal to—that is, the same as—or will outweigh any disadvantages and spell out why that is. He should spell out the method of calculation and the assumptions behind it so that people are clear about it—not just those in Committee but, more importantly, those who work for AEA Technology now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can accept that and that Conservative Members can say, "Yes, we are pushing ahead with this privatisation but one of the least things that should happen is that people ought to be clear about their pension rights." Although I might take the Minister's remarks that his intentions are to ensure that schemes are upheld and that people get enhanced rights in good faith, those issues ought to be spelt out in the Bill, not simply left as a background murmur so that people are unclear about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will advise us to withdraw the amendment on the grounds that the issue could be reconsidered in a Government amendment on Report or that he will accept the modest amendment now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can afford to be brief on this group of amendments as we have already discussed the principles involved at length. The amendments concern the right of
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
trade unions to be involved in consultation on the schemes outlined in the schedule and to give their agreement before a transfer takes place. The Government should specify that trade unions represent the work force in paragraph 3 of schedule 3, which refers to those persons who appear to the Secretary of State to represent employees of the authority. That is a perfectly reasonable point, and I should not have to justify it. The Minister will consult with trade unions, and there is no reason not to make that clear in the Bill. In the interests of the harmony of the Committee, he will undoubtedly be willing to accept my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment No. 55 is more contentious. It states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"except that, where any person consulted under the provisions of sub-paragraph (5) above is not satisfied with any proposals made by the Authority or the Secretary, of State, as the case may be, in the course of such consultations, the Authority or the Secretary of State, as the case may be, shall not proceed with those proposals until the person is so satisfied."</p></blockquote>
We have heard the Minister say repeatedly that everything is clean and above board; that no employee of AEA Technology will be disadvantaged in any of the schemes and that the Opposition have shown breathtaking cheek by questioning that. I assume, therefore, that the Minister will accept that reasonable amendment. We all know that the representatives of IPMS and other unions are reasonable people who seek only to secure an adequate deal for their members on transfer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, if everything is as the Minister says and no one has anything to worry about, he can have no reason to reject the amendments. I am sure that he is preparing to give his assent to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is, of course, very different. We have been given vague ball park figures about the possible value of transfers—the Minister mentioned £120 million and £160 million. He has said nothing about the current value of the total accrued liabilities under the pension scheme. Figures must be available—the Government Actuary's Department must keep a current record. I shall table parliamentary questions after our sitting to tease that information from the Minister so that we can make a comparison. We have heard phrases such as "broadly comparable" and "no less favourable". If the proposed schemes are no less favourable, the Minister will surely accept that the agreement of the men and women of the trade unions—who are reasonable people—will give proposals a certain cachet and confirm that the work force are satisfied with what is being done. In reality, however, the Government are not interested in what the work force think and will pursue the course they think fit, irrespective of whether the proposed scheme is comparable with the current one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept that the amendments are reasonable, but I fear that he will not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are designed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
to ensure that genuine consultation takes place on new pension arrangements. I represented working people on the shop floor for a large part of my life and I know the way in which the word "consultation" can be used. It has many different meanings. At best, it can mean more than just negotiating rights if the company genuinely wants to consult the representatives of the work force and take them into its confidence about the company's future direction. At worst, it means that the company tells employees, either orally or in writing, what it intends to do—and having told them, goes ahead and does it irrespective of whether or not the employees want to discuss with the company its intentions or raise any issues with it. I have seen numerous examples of that worst sort of consultation. It means nothing, but the company can claim that consultation has taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy, it comes down to one's view of the ownership of the current pension assets and whether one believes that they transfer to the new owners of the privatised companies or that the members of the pension scheme own the assets of the scheme to which they have contributed, which effectively become deferred earnings belonging to them. If one takes the latter view—which I certainly do—one is entitled to argue that scheme members should be able to block any transfers with which they are not satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Rendel 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I looked at what I said about consultation a week ago, I realised that I could have repeated myself on these amendments. I do not intend to do so, because unfortunately the Government paid little attention to what I said on that occasion. I suspect they would pay equally little attention now, because that is the Government's view of consultation and its importance in such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is worth repeating briefly my point that it is in the Government's interests that they should consult as widely as possible and include trade unions in that consultation. I do not understand why they refused to agree to that last Tuesday, nor why they refuse to do so again today. We need to maximise consultation, if only to reduce staff disaffection—which, as we have said all along, is one of the Bill's main problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, there is a significant difference between consultation and handing over a veto to the staff. I am not, entirely happy about amendments Nos. 55 and 61, which take the whole process one step further than mere consultation. To make those two amendments to the Bill would be dangerous, if only because the temptation would be there to minimise the amount of consultation, to ensure that the minimum number of people had the right of veto over the results of consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman accepts and understands that managements effectively have a veto. Would he deny the staff or their representatives the opportunity to be in an equal position to management in pension arrangements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difficulty in giving too many
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
people a veto over any one decision, because that may result in no decision being made. After proper consultation—which, as has been said, the Government know little about—the time must come to take a decision. Sadly, not everyone can be given the right of decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman care to say what he would consider to be reasonable consultation and with how many unions? Is he aware that eight, possibly nine, trade unions are represented at AEA Technology?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no reason to suppose that the number of unions to be consulted would make any difference to our decision as to whether any of them should be consulted. From the Government's point of view, it would be beneficial to widen consultation. The fact that more unions are involved in this company than in others is not a reason for rejecting the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendments that would increase the amount of consultation that is bound to take place, but I am not happy about the amendments that hand over a veto to those consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the desire of the hon. Members for Kirkcaldy and for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) to ensure that trade unions are consulted by the Secretary of State or the authority. I can reassure hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel), that it is our intention that all relevant trade unions will be consulted. Frankly, it would be perverse to interpret the Bill in any other way. It provides no protection against a failure to consult persons who represent employees, such as the unions, so the intention is to consult them fully and widely on these matters to give them a chance to make their views known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee should bear in mind that the Secretary of State and the authority will have to consult employees who are not union members. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) referred to the number of unions. Some employees may not be members of a union and they will have to be consulted. The wording provides some protection should someone argue that they should have been consulted but were not, even though it was not obvious to the Secretary of State or the authority that they should have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was stung by the words of the hon. Member for Leeds, West. His accusation that I was blurring the issue and being unclear was completely and utterly unjustified. Just to show that I am magnanimous and do not hear a grudge, I can tell him that the Government Actuary's Department will make its assumptions known at the time, so that it can help with the calculations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will come as no surprise to Opposition Members that I cannot accept amendments Nos. 55 and 61, which would give the unions or anyone consulted a veto over the shape of the new pension scheme. I welcome the support of the hon. Member for Newbury on that point. He outlined the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0493">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
practical conditions with admirable clarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are placing a statutory duty on the Secretary of State or on the authority to be satisfied that the new scheme, taken as a whole, is no less favourable than the authority scheme. While that duty reflects the Government's longstanding practice, to reassure employees, we have included the provision in the Bill. I hope that those explanations will enable the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
addition to a Bill concerned with the setting up and ultimate privatisation of successor companies to AEA Technology. Unlike the rest of the Bill, it does not refer to AEA Technology. The three excruciatingly dull—I was going to use an unparliamentary phrase—schedules refer to it, but not the clause, which refers to the AEA—Government division. Should not we have had a separate Bill on that? Why the Government have muscled that one miserable clause into the Bill defeats me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) Section 1 of the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1954 it shall be amended as follows.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) In subsection (2) (which provides that the Authority shall consist of a chairman"—no politically correct language there—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"and not less than seven nor more than fifteen other members) for 'seven' there shall be substituted 'four'.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3) In subsection (3) (which provides that all the members are to be appointed by the Secretary of State and that certain of them are to have certain experience) the words from 'and of those members' to the end shall be omitted."</p></blockquote>
In other words, they do not have to have any experience at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may refresh the memory of the Committee, clause 1(3) of the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1954 states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) All the members of the Authority shall be appointed by the Lord President of the Council and of those members—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) three shall be appointed from amongst persons appearing to the Lord President of the Council to be persons who have had wide experience of, and shown capacity in dealing with, problems associated with atomic energy".</p></blockquote>
Let us remember that we are talking about the Atomic Energy Authority. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) one shall be appointed from amongst persons appearing to the Lord President of the Council to have had wide experience of, and shown capacity in, administration and finance".</p></blockquote>
That would seem a fairly useful attribute for the member of a board of a company that size. Finally:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) one shall be appointed from amongst persons appearing to the Lord President of the Council to have had wide experience of, and shown capacity in, the organisation of workers."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has told us what he thinks about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three members should have wide experience of and have shown capacity in dealing with problems associated with atomic energy. We are talking about an authority that will be decommissioning nuclear reactors and spending vast sums of public money in so doing, yet the President of the Board of Trade now sees fit to have nobody on the board of that company who knows anything about the subject. I said on Second Reading that I wondered whether the Minister or one of his colleagues had themselves in mind for an appointment to that authority. I am not sure
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
whether the Minister fails to qualify. As far as I know, he has an engineering background, so he may know something about atomic energy—it is quite rare for a Minister in the Department of Trade and Industry to have any background whatsoever in industry, but let that pass.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may also have some experience and capacity in administration and finance—or, if not, one or two of his more deserving colleagues will doubtless shortly be looking for something to do, in preparation for their inevitable unemployment after the next election, and might well think themselves well-qualified for the job. It would be difficult to find someone who did not know anything about any of those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the Minister has been a wee bit over-inclusive and ought to have been more careful with the wording. Some of his hon. Friends might be disappointed to discover that the little sinecures that they had lined up for when they leave office had suddenly been snatched from them, on the ground that they did have experience in any of those important areas. Joking apart—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So you were joking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only in part, Mr. Hill. The provisions strike us as unnecessary and, in the case of the first, rather disturbing. It is appropriate for the board of the Atomic Energy Authority Government division to include at least one person who knows something about atomic energy, other than the fact that it makes things glow in the dark. A wee bit more insight than that would be nice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps, after reflection and consultation with his advisers, the Minister might conclude that the provision is unnecessary. Whilst the Government might want to reduce the numbers, surely they do not want—and there is no need—to reduce the level of expertise of board members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Purchase</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last week I got into trouble for asking phrase "How daft can you get?" I did not intend to refer to the Chairman, so my words were properly corrected to "How daft can the Government be?" I hold to that view, but today I will reinforce it asking how dangerous the Government can get.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy debated the matter with an admirable lightness of touch, I view the provision as a significant change and do not doubt for a minute the reason for its proposal. It does not surprise me. Perhaps my hon. Friend was right to say that it is extraordinary to see it in the context of this Bill, but I am not at all surprised—I understand its purpose perfectly. It would ensure that ideology is not informed by knowledge and would tidy up and dispense with any opinion that might be contrary to the ideology that has driven along successive privatisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision is dangerous because without informed knowledge and, more importantly, understanding by the new owner organisation, which is supposed to oversee what goes on, it is exceedingly difficult even to contemplate decisions in a way that will approximate to
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
sensible and wise counsel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who has served on a technical body, will know that, even though the lay person's experience, knowledge and ability are most welcome and a vital part of the process, the technical knowledge that is embodied in such an organisation is vital to true and proper understanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I served for many years on a health authority that had the great fortune to be informed at board level by consultants who worked in a clinical capacity in the organisation. It would often have been possible to come to a decision based on my personal ideology but which did not necessarily reflect fully and properly the working practices and the understanding of people with technical know-how, who might not otherwise have been part of that body. By their presence, however, they helped to amend decisions. That approach is entirely sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot deny the Government's right to their ideology any more than my own party's right to ours. Our political ideologies are understood and used as our driving force. However, we are deciding a matter that is and will continue to be so dangerous that it is absolutely ridiculous to change the provisions for a supervisory body from having specific and particular qualifications to a requirement for simple, generalist knowledge—however, well meaning—which could mean a lack of understanding of the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the AEA, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy said, is to supervise, investigate, report upon and understand installations at which work with dangerous materials and processes is undertaken. Without an adequate supervisory body, I fear the worst. The Government should go away and think again. Let them proceed with their brand of ideology, but above all they must ensure safety for the rest of us. The authority itself is being reduced in size, which is also an important issue. So a number of different issues must be dealt with—not least that of administration and proper financial management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a privatised authority—who knows, it may ultimately become a Government division—I hope that an appropriate supervisory body would continue. Virtually to dismantle and strip the body of technical knowledge vital to success is foolhardy. I shall resist employing the word "sinister" about this manoeuvre, but it is certainly foolhardy. I ask the Minister to think further about this matter, which is really an appendage to the main issue which could be cut off without anyone realising it. We could then have a proper study later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just yesterday, I gave a lecture to members of the board of Nuclear Electric in connection with my study in that company for the Industry and Parliament Trust. My function was to examine the success or otherwise of the total quality management system. I found it most interesting. It is worth considering the breadth of skills necessary to manage that particular company—well above the normal skills required for the management of manufacturing operations because of the unique
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0495">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
requirements of the product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should ensure that any body regulating or exercising control on behalf of the Government is as broadly based as the board within the company. The skills required to perform the duties of the Government division could not logically exclude expertise in atomic energy, so why have the Government chosen to remove that element from the definition? Nor could skills in organising workers sensibly be excluded. The clause is therefore illogical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There might be an argument for reviewing the membership of Government division, but this is not the right place, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East said. This matter involves the safety of workers in the industry and of the public and deserves greater attention than can be given in one throw-away clause in the Bill. It would be helpful if the Minister explained why he raised this issue. It is utterly irrational, although that is in keeping with many clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my colleagues, I am concerned about the clause. I turned to the Department's notes on clauses in an attempt to find the reasons behind the proposals, but they give no justification for cutting the number of members from seven to four. They state instead that such a reduction is problematic and might not allow current areas of expertise to be retained. That is used as the reason for removing the requirement for expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy noted that it would be unwise to remove the requirement on members of this organisation to have a knowledge of atomic energy, financial administration or the organisation of workers. The only reason given is that it might not be possible
	<br><blockquote><p>"to accommodate each requirement of expertise, while still allowing room for other desirable experience and expertise"</p></blockquote>
given the reduction in numbers. That worries Opposition Members. Instead of specific requirements for expertise we find references to
	<br><blockquote><p>"other desirable experience and expertise".</p></blockquote>
Who would the clause refer to? Does that phrase refer euphemistically to long-standing members of the Tory party, ex-Secretaries of State or ex-Members of Parliament? Will the Minister tell us what that phrase means? If he can, we might be able to determine whether the clause really is foolhardy, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East said, or whether there is something more sinister to it, as has been the case in other privatisations. We must determine whether we will really replace people having genuine ability and expertise with political placemen or placewomen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy for his personal references to me. I am the only Minister to have served an indentured apprenticeship in mechanical engineering. It would be interesting to discover how many
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
Opposition spokesmen have a similar knowledge of the real world and of the shop floor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are wrecking amendments. Clause 10 provides for the minimum membership of the authority, excluding the chairman, to be reduced from seven to four. It is important to realise that we are talking about the authority as it will be after AEA Technology is free to operate in the private sector, not the current authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed changes reflect the reduced scale of the residual authority's activities post privatisation and the different nature of those activities as compared with UKAEA's original nuclear mission. The intention is to give flexibility to appoint members with the range of skills and abilities that is relevant to the authority's revised mission, while at the same time keeping the numbers down to an optimum level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circumstances of the residual UKAEA will be different from those that it enjoyed in the 1950s and 1960s. The old authority was a massive research organisation with thousands of employees. The residual organisation will be a management and procurement body with only a small fraction of the staff and responsibilities that the authority had at its height.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that when we discussed the Bill on the Floor of the House, it was made clear that research into nuclear fusion would be retained? Is that the case? Who would have the ability to cast a judgement on that, if there was no one with any expertise on the board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the question of expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would produce changes that need to be reflected in the mix of skills and expertise that is available to the authority at board level. In the same way, such changes are reflected in the composition of the divisional board that oversees Government division's operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members had a little fun at the expense of the clause. An interesting parallel would be whether politicians should make decisions only on matters about which they have particular knowledge and skills. Politicians seem to move between areas for which they have had no previous training whatever. Opposition Members—I do not blame them for having a gallop around the park; for it is all part of the game—have, however, been slightly dismissive of the divisional board. It is chaired by Dr. Brian Eyre, who is the chief executive of the authority and has a long and distinguished career in the nuclear industry in fields that are directly related to the core activities of Government division. In addition, the board includes the well-known Dr. Derek Pooley, Government division's chief executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other members of senior management also have extensive nuclear expertise. There are four non-executive directors from the private sector. One, as I said, is an expert in property management; the second, an expert in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
procurement; the third, an expert in planning and the fourth, a financial expert. The mix of nuclear and non-nuclear expertise will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that I cannot foresee a time when the board of the residual authority will not have such residual nuclear expertise. I should add that it is perfectly within the power of any effective and logically run board to call in the services of experts who can give appropriate advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides the flexibility to appoint members who will be able to provide the skills necessary for the authority to carry out its mission effectively. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
