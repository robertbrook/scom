<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good morning. I hope that hon. Members had a satisfactory and restful weekend. The weather is super and I trust that that will be reflected in the quality of our debate. I need not add that the sky is currently predominantly blue, but anything can happen.<br><br>
We come now to a stand part debate on clause 45. I remind the Committee that it relates to companies that carry on life assurance business and refers in the main to schedule 8, which we shall debate next.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I shall seek to catch your eye either on this clause or when we come to schedule 8 stand part to ask for a debate on specific aspects covered by the clause and the schedule. It would be logical to do so at the end of our debate on schedule 8, but if you are not minded to allow such a debate then, I shall raise the matter on this clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to help the hon. Gentleman by saying that it would be more appropriate to have a wide-ranging debate on the schedule rather than on the clause.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish you, Mr. Winterton, a happy and romantic Valentine's day. I wish the same to my hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 218</span>
Friend the Minister, who is the self-styled world's greatest lover. I also wish my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) a very happy birthday. Opposition Members should take no notice whatever of the report in "Black Dog" that
<br><blockquote><p>"Labour's whips are a ruthless lot. They've put all their fresh-faced, enthusiastic by-election winners on the interminably dull Finance Bill Committee because no one else would do the job."</p></blockquote>
The good news is that many who started in such a lowly position have risen to great heights, including the Leader of the Opposition and those on the Committee Opposition Front Bench.<br><br>
I turn to my interminably dull amendment. It was proposed by the Association of British Insurers, which welcomes the Treasury's decision that life assurance companies should receive the same tax treatment for business that is sold direct from the United Kingdom to European residents as is already given to business that is sold from overseas branches. That removes a tax barrier to United Kingdom life insurance companies that compete in the European single insurance market. The result should be increased exports of life insurance with consequent benefits for both the United Kingdom insurance industry and the Exchequer. At present the proposals are limited to sales to residents of the European Economic Area. That contrasts with business that is written through overseas branches where the same treatment is available without any geographical limit.<br><br>
The ABI suggests that proposals for services businesses in paragraph 2 should apply also to non-United Kingdom residents on a worldwide basis, and that is what the amendment is designed to achieve. That extension would increase business opportunities for United Kingdom life insurance companies and, most importantly, greatly simplify the administration of the scheme both for companies and for the Inland Revenue because it will not be necessary to distinguish between two categories of non-United Kingdom-resident policy holders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith). It is important that our insurance industry should not be put at a disadvantage against those based in other countries. It is equally important that our companies should not be forced to go overseas to take advantage of opportunities to exploit world markets. For those reasons, I believe that the amendment should be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Waterson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, support the amendment, which is useful, practical and designed to remove a potentially serious anomaly in the Bill.<br><br>
The British insurance industry can be a world beater, when freed from the sort of shackles with which it has been bound in Europe in the past. One of the best arguments for creating a genuine single market in insurance and insurance-based services is the amount of expertise and experience to be found in the British insurance business. Many of us regarded our reason for entering the European Union—the European Community as it was—as being to create a free market and a single market. That remains the predominant reason for being a member state, and nowhere is it more valid than in respect of the insurance industry.<br><br>
My hon. Friends have already touched on the potential anomaly that there will be no geographical limit for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0631">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 219</span>
business written through overseas branches. There is no logical reason for that and I fear that it might result in a substantial movement offshore of both personnel and business from this country. I join my hon. Friends in supporting the ABI's proposal that an amendment should be made to remove from the definition the requirement of residence in the EEA and, instead, simply require that the policyholder be non-resident in the United Kingdom. That would be a simple and easily enforced provision and I support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also support the amendment and the points raised by my three hon. Friends. At this point, it may be appropriate for me to declare not an interest, but a background in this area. I have no links with the insurance industry at present, but prior to my election to this House I worked for some years as a corporate in-house counsel in the insurance industry and international business formed part of my responsibilities.<br><br>
All of my hon. Friends who have spoken on the amendment put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield have made important points. I do not want business to move offshore, and I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) that there would be a danger of that happening if the amendment were rejected. The United Kingdom insurance industry is one of the crown jewels of Britain's financial strength. It is extremely important that our insurance industry should be given the maximum possible opportunity to operate in the rest of the world. I hope that even if my hon. Friends on the Front Bench are unable to give us comfort this morning, they will reflect on the important points raised here and be prepared to consider the matter further—if not today, then on Report. These are crucial matters and the insurance industry should not be handicapped in any way in continuing to expand throughout the world.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The ABI has written to all members of the Committee putting forward a forceful argument for the extension of the concession. If the Government intend to oppose the amendment it will be interesting to hear whether they do so on the ground of cost or for some other reason.<br><br>
I agree with those Conservative Members who have said that we should do nothing that would hamper the development of the British insurance industry throughout the world, but rather do everything that we can to encourage it. I will not say anything further on that point now, but I will develop it slightly on the stand part debate to which I referred earlier. At this stage, I can say that we support the general proposition behind the amendments. We shall wait to hear what the Government have to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Anthony Nelson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield for the felicitous way in which he introduced the debate, but I must correct him on one point. His kind remark about me as the world's greatest lover does not refer to a self-styled title—I received it from my nearest and dearest. I would not claim such prowess for myself. I hope that I have not set the hearts of the hon. Members for Durham, North-West (Ms Armstrong) and for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) fluttering by wearing a badge
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
declaring that title. It was not my intention to inflame the debate at such an early stage.<br><br>
The amendment raises an important issue relating to the competitiveness and opportunities of the British life assurance industry. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South that it is a crown jewel of this country's financial services industry. The schedule would extend such opportunities by moving onshore the provision of gross service business, which previously had to be operated offshore.<br><br>
The investment return accruing from non-resident policyholders who took out their policies at an overseas branch has always been exempt from UK tax in the hands of the insurance company. As a result of the EC third life insurance directive, which established the single market in life assurance in the European Union, UK companies became entitled to sell policies to residents of other member states directly from the UK, without setting up an establishment in the other state. That is known as services business.<br><br>
The UK insurance industry urged the Government to extend the effective exemption of policies sold through a branch to policies sold directly into Europe, arguing that UK insurers would otherwise be at a disadvantage as most other European states tax life assurance on a different basis from that in the UK. The Government accepted those arguments and have therefore introduced an extension of overseas life assurance business in schedule 8, covering policies sold in the European Economic Area.<br><br>
That decision follows the report entitled, "The single market in life assurance: Taxation of business sold on a services basis", which the ABI commissioned from Price Waterhouse and sent to my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor on 14 September 1992. The report argued that the then current gross basis for business written from a non-UK branch of a UK insurance company should be extended to services business within the EC. We do not believe that the exemption should go further. The arguments for extension of overseas life assurance business have, up to now, all been in terms of European business. Many other countries do not permit direct selling into their territories and outside the European Union many countries tax life assurance business in a similar way to the UK, so UK companies selling there are not at any competitive disadvantage caused by the tax.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
A UK life assurance company can have a subsidiary or a branch in another European member state—or anywhere else in the world—through which it can offer life assurance on a gross basis. The proposal is to offer that directly from a base in the United Kingdom. There is the possibility of offering gross life assurance business through subsidiaries or branches elsewhere. That reform would involve costs in some instances.<br><br>
I have listened to the arguments that have been fairly put by my hon. Friends and by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling), who has given the amendment the broad thrust of his support. If it is possible to do such business offshore anyway, through a subsidiary or a branch abroad, and to offer the gross fund roll-up facilities of a life assurance policy, why not do the logical thing and offer it on a direct services basis from the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0632">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 221</span>
United Kingdom? The Government have sought to promote reciprocity in the liberalisation of financial services, which has helped to gain access to other markets in life assurance and to other industries. We shall consider one aspect of that when we discuss clause 50. The reform has helped to open the way for the liberalisation of services internationally. That is harder to do outside the European Union, where we do not have a directive that covers the life assurance industry—but, in a sense, that is no reaon why we should close the door to such business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Hoon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ashfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister demonstrated some of the difficulties in writing insurance policies across the European Union, which was caused by problems with premium payments and the consequent problems with taxation and with making payments to those who are entitled to them. Would it be sensible for premiums to be written in a single European currency?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman tempts me with his question. I notice that there is some bemusement among Opposition Members. I am sure that were the hon. Gentleman to propound such a proposition with any vigour it would cause a good deal of dissension within his party. Companies can offer a life assurance policy abroad in any medium of exchange that they wish. If a life assurance company wanted to do that in ecus, it could do so. There is nothing to prevent it. However, I suspect that that was not the answer that the hon. Gentleman wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister concede that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central raised a serious point? All financial products—life assurance, unit trusts and so on—tend to be sold on historic record. It is impossible to make sensible comparisons of performance of historic products in different currencies. If British companies want to get the full credit for superior management performance and better track record—which they achieved through managing sterling-related products—by marketing their services elsewhere in the European Union, it would be a great help to them if there were a single currency. In that case, all products could be set out with track records that were entirely comparable on a similar currency basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While I might not hesitate for an eternity before agreeing that there might be something in my hon. Friend's comments, I should immediately countermand myself by saying that it is not impossible to compare the performance of different products from different countries on an historic basis by using something known as an exchange rate. One can work out the differential performance of various funds. A compelling case can be made for a single currency, although I shall not do so this morning, but I would not make the principal pillar of that case the marketing opportunities of the life assurance industry. Experience has shown that the success of the life assurance industry in selling abroad, as well as at home, has been built up despite the fact that many currencies operate not only in the European Union but outside it. We follow with interest the fact that other countries within the European Union—notably Luxembourg—have in recent years become a home, if not a haven, for substantial collective investment and savings schemes. That has less to do with a particular currency evaluation than with the flexibility and tax regime on offer there.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 222</span>
Although the ABI did not, as far as I am aware, call until fairly late in the day for an extension beyond the EEA, and although most of the calls from the ABI have been for what the Government have implanted in the schedule, I should be prepared to consider the case for extending it further.<br><br>
I cannot accept the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield because it is technically deficient. However, he has raised an important issue, which I would like my officials to discuss more carefully with the industry. Some people may not be in favour of the provision as it may create problems for some companies. However, by and large common sense tells me and other members of the committee that as companies are able to offer the provision on an offshore basis through branches and subsidiaries—and they are now able to do so within the European Union—the balance of advantage probably lies in extending the measure to worldwide business. I should like that proposal to be subject to more discussion with the industry before any further measure is introduced in the Bill or subsequently.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would help the Committee if the Minister could tell us why the Government have not already extended the provision. I appreciate that he is being very accommodating and that the Government might be minded to extend it. Presumably, when the schedule was drafted the Treasury must have considered that its measures would be restricted to the European Union. Why was that? What arguments were produced against extension?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, many other countries do not permit direct selling into their territories. We were also concerned about whether, in extending such a right outside the area covered by the single market in those services, there might be difficulties and disadvantages as well as opportunities for life assurance companies. As I also said, as far as I am aware that matter had not been particularly requested by the industry until recently. I do not think that there are any revenue implications because although various countries operate different systems for taxing life assurance companies, the tax regime exists in the United Kingdom to tax as appropriate the maturity value of those policies at home and abroad, either within or without the life assurance company.<br><br>
Because an extension had not been requested, because many countries do not permit direct sales into them, and because there might have been unforeseen difficulties, the measure was felt to be an appropriate curtailing of the right. However, we are prepared sensibly to examine the matter. If we find that there are no great disadvantages and that the industry feels that there is a significant opportunity—eminent members of the industry have made representations to my hon. Friends and, perhaps, others on the subject—we do not want unfairly to restrict the provision. However, I cannot make a commitment that we shall definitely take that action because the matter has to be thought through and consulted about properly. I hope that the Committee understands that I am prepared to give such consultations a fair wind and see what emanates from them. If there is an opportunity in the Bill or subsequently to extend the provision, there might be a case for so doing.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0633">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 223</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his most helpful response. I understand entirely that when the schedule was drafted it was essentially on the basis that it was a single market proposal in response to the third life directive. The subsequent suggestion has been that it might be useful to widen the measure to a worldwide basis. I also understand that it may have limited value—it is not clear to what extent UK life companies can sell direct to other territories, many of which may have restrictions.<br><br>
When my hon. Friend the Minister responds to the schedule stand part debate, I hope that he will be able to say to what extent the GATT agreement, which was supposed to liberalise trade and services, will help. It would be useful to know how valuable the amendment would be in practice, given that many countries probably have restrictions. I appreciate that my hon. Friend wants to consult with the industry. I am happy with that and, on that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 146, in page 213, line 41, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"() In paragraph 1(5) for 'life assurance fund and separate annuity fund, if any,' substitute 'long term business fund'.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 147.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In material as long and necessarily complicated as the life assurance provisions in schedule 8, it sometimes happens that despite the best efforts of the parliamentary draftsmen and officials, the odd consequential drafting change is missed. The amendments simply pick up a couple of necessary consequential changes which were not identified until after the Bill was published. The provisions in schedule 8 are long and extensive. They make substantive changes to the way in which life insurers are taxed and also consolidate, rationalise and update the existing rules. That should benefit insurers and practitioners.<br><br>
Amendment No. 147 would ensure that the tax charge under the income I minus E basis on the investment return accruing for policy holders does not escape taxation in circumstances where it has been previously argued that the tax charge was lost. Legislation introduced in 1992 makes it clear that the charge is preserved when an insurer makes a trading loss on its life assurance business. Schedule 8 replaces an existing rule about insurers' losses with the new rule in paragraph 19. If the 1992 provision is not changed to refer to the new rule for losses, substantial I minus E tax charges will be at risk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise a minor point. We have been talking about consulting the industry. I believe that the industry has written to more than just me pointing out that there has been no prior consultation. I do not think that it is necessary for the Government to consult with everyone before they do anything. There may be good reasons for not doing so, in particular when they plug loopholes that allow them not to consult. However, as the ABI has said that there was no consultation, that begs the question whether there is usually consultation. On what matters do the Government consult and on what matters
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 224</span>
do they not consult? It would be helpful if the Minister could respond to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try. The Government attempt to consult as far and as often as possible on issues that do not have to remain confidential until the last moment. We have tried to consult on the tax regime as it applies to the life assurance industry. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the relevant but rather arcane tax regime dates back to the 1915 Finance Act, the provisions of which will be immediately familiar to all members of the Committee. One of the schedules of the 1915 Act firmly established the I—E basis for the life assurance industry. Since then, changes have been necessary to extrapolate the various component parts of the profits of the life assurance industry so that we are able to tax appropriately the stream of funds belonging to policyholders and the trading return of the life assurance company itself.<br><br>
The recent changes in the 1988 and 1989 Finance Acts were subject to a review announced by the former Financial Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough (Mr. Dorrell). The review took two forms, one of which was a review of the implementation and effectiveness of certain changes introduced by those two Acts. The other was a much wider review of the whole I—E basis, which is a continuing review with the industry.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
There are differences of opinion within the industry about the whole basis of the tax regime. Some favour the gross roll-up provisions that are more evident in other European Union countries. Others wish to retain the I—E basis that has evolved here and, to some extent, in other countries, notably Commonwealth countries. However, the Government have decided that, at least for the time being, the present law should be retained and improved. That accounts for certain changes that were introduced by the former Financial Secretary and upon which schedule 8 builds.<br><br>
To answer the question of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central, all those changes, both to the detail and to the overall regime, have been the subject of close consultation with the industry. It is certainly the Government's intention to continue that process and the debate on the previous amendment demonstrated that we listen to the industry when it has something to say.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 88, in page 217, line 38, leave out "1995" and insert "1990".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 89, in page 234, line 14, at end add:—
<br><blockquote><p>"50A. The amendment made by paragraph 16(3) above has effect in relation to accounting periods ending on or after 1 January 1994.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is necessary to give a brief explanation of why the Association of British Insurers and many of its members strongly believe that the amendment is necessary. I would be grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister would carefully consider the amendments and, if he is unable to give us a helpful answer today, perhaps he will consider them further on Report.<br><br>

My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor has accepted that the present rules for calculating investment return from the type of life assurance business covered by the schedule do not work as intended. Paragraph 16 of schedule 8 provides a solution but, unfortunately, it covers only accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 1995. It has already become clear to many companies involved and to the ABI that the anomaly in the existing rules could result in substantial extra tax liabilities for many companies in 1994. The ABI has already identified at least 14 companies, which represent no less than 32 per cent. of the whole United Kingdom life assurance market, that would be affected if the amendments are not accepted. It is estimated that additional tax of not less than £455 million might be payable, more than doubling the tax liabilities of each of the companies affected. We are talking about a substantial and significant provision. That tax would not be recoverable.<br><br>
The provisions proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and I, which are supported by the ABI, would backdate the proposals in paragraph 16 to meet the needs of those companies. There can be no objection on grounds of retrospection because it is agreed that the existing rules have been defective ever since they were introduced in 1990. The potentially serious effects of the defect, which are likely to arise in respect of 1994, should be dealt with now that the need to deal with the problem has been agreed by the Treasury. No life company or its policyholders can be adversely affected by backdating paragraph (16) in that way, as the change that paragraph (16) makes is a wholly relieving measure.<br><br>
It is important to understand that, in the case of with-profits business, the mechanism for apportioning investment return between different types of business is determined by reference to the bonuses paid to policyholders of that type of business. Where there is a mixture of with-profit and non-profit business in a fund, an apportionment by reference to bonuses can underestimate the return to the non-participating business. There is therefore a further mechanism, known in the insurance trade as the floor, to allocate investment return according to the ratio of the company's liabilities to different classes of policyholder, which applies where it gives a greater figure than the bonus-based method.<br><br>
If a company changes the way in which it calculates its liabilities to its policyholders, the floor can result in the profit from, for example, pension business substantially exceeding the overall profit from the whole business. That was not intended, and paragraph (16) of schedule 8 as it stands proposes to amend the operation of the floor by providing that a company may set off the amounts by which the bonus-method calculation has exceeded the floor-method calculation in previous years against the floor-method calculation in a year in which the floor applies.<br><br>
Paragraph (16) currently applies only for accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 1995. Amendments Nos. 88 and 89 provide that paragraph (16) should apply for accounting periods ending on or after 1 January 1994 and take account of excesses arising since the introduction of the floor in 1990.<br><br>
The provisions in the amendments standing in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and myself have been strongly supported by several
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 226</span>
companies, which have taken the trouble to contact me directly. In particular, I received helpful notes from Mr. Paul Grace, managing director and actuary of Scottish Equitable pension trustees, and from Sir Christopher Harding, the chairman of Legal & General, who wrote that he was
<br><blockquote><p>"particularly pleased to see in the Inland Revenue's Budget Press Release IR43 that the Chancellor proposed to amend the way the 'floor' operated to remove the, admittedly, unintended application."</p></blockquote>
The Treasury admits that the application was unintended. Sir Christopher stressed that he hoped that those further amendments would be considered.<br><br>
An important point was raised by Mr. Kevin McBrien, chief executive of the National Provident Institution, who used an especially neat phrase to describe the anomaly that my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and I are trying to correct. He pointed out that:
<br><blockquote><p>"This is a case where the little man has been 'floored by the flawed floor'."</p></blockquote>
That phrase may cause problems for <i>Hansard,</i> but I am happy to show them the different spellings in that elegant phrase. Mr. McBrien goes on to stress that:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is particularly clear in the case of a company like my own"—</p></blockquote>
that is, NPI—
<br><blockquote><p>"where the tax will fall on policyholders since we are a mutual company."</p></blockquote>
He makes the important point that most of NPI's policyholders are self-employed and have their personal pensions provided by NPI and that:
<br><blockquote><p>"It cannot have been the intention of Parliament to disadvantage our policyholders vis-à-vis policyholders in other companies and other pension schemes."</p></blockquote>
Mr. O'Brien also states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Because of the inadequacies of the drafting of this provision in the Finance Act 1990"—</p></blockquote>
in which it originally appeared—
<br><blockquote><p>"the decline in the market values of stock markets and in Government securities in 1994 can give rise to a spurious tax liability. The impact is entirely capricious."</p></blockquote>
A reduction in market value leads to an increase in tax. That cannot have been intended and, as Mr. O'Brien points out, it cannot be justified.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will be able to help us this morning, but if he cannot do so this morning, I hope that he will consult carefully and perhaps accept our amendments on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also received a letter from Mr. McBrien, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Dear Mr. Smith … I would urge you to support the amendments put down by Mr. Tim Smith".</p></blockquote>
That is what I shall now do, for the reasons given by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Hawkins). I shall not enlarge on the point of principle, but the ABI may have made a mild tactical error in quantifying the cost of the measure. If the cost is £455 million, my hon. Friend might be concerned that the amendment would add half a billion pounds to the public sector borrowing requirement. I shall be interested to hear what the cost is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the ABI and Mr. McBrien have written to all of us and I shall not take up the Committee's time by reading out those parts of the letter
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0635">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 227</span>
that have not yet been read out. We all get the drift of it.<br><br>
The amendment raises three specific points. As the hon. Member for Blackpool, South said, Mr. McBrien makes the point that in many cases mutual companies and not shareholders are involved, although the class of taxpayers involved must, by definition, be fairly narrow in that not everyone will have policies with that insurance company. The argument is not compelling.<br><br>
The second point is that 1994 was a special year and because of a curious set of circumstances some companies could find that they are paying more tax than they expected. As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said, mention was made of half a billion pounds, which is not insignificant.<br><br>
When listening to the hon. Member for Blackpool, South I was reminded of exactly the same debate that we had when discussing petroleum revenue tax and the effect of the changes to that tax regime on one or two companies which had purchased oil rigs at the wrong time. Because of the changes, those companies were liable for substantial tax bills. The same argument was deployed then—that it would not be retrospection because the companies did not know anything about it and it was never intended that that should happen. There was sympathy at that stage for that proposition.<br><br>
Retrospection is a difficult subject. If we agreed to a retrospective change for one class of taxpayers, no matter how deserving, we would open the door to a host of other cases for which there might also be sympathy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recall that I said that one reason why retrospection would be less of an anathema in this instance was because of the effect of the schedule—and the paragraph that we are discussing—as a relieving measure. I suspect that that might not have been so in relation to the petroleum revenue tax to which the hon. Gentleman referred. The hon. Gentleman is nodding.<br><br>
I stress the importance of the fact that the provision is a relieving measure and that there cannot be any adverse effects from retrospection. I suggest that that is the most important part of the ABI's case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said, I do not have a hard and fast line on retrospection, but every Finance Bill contains some relieving measures and some that are far from relieving. The Finance Bill is never absolutely right and we subsequently find anomalies that Parliament did not intend or loopholes that must be closed. I have some sympathy with an industry that is faced with half a billion pounds more tax than it expected, but as a matter of general principle, it is not the only industry or set of taxpayers that may find itself in that position. The Government may say that they have been convinced by the arguments advanced by those who tabled the amendment and that they will consult or accede to the amendments in their present form or something similar. I do not know and I shall be interested to hear.<br><br>
We have to be very careful about retrospection. If we agree to a retrospective change for one class of taxpayer because we have sympathy with them and because it can be argued that the effects were never intended, we have to bear in mind that there may be many other cases—the oil
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 228</span>
company that I mentioned is just one that comes to mind—of taxpayers who would feel aggrieved at not having been given the same treatment. That said, clearly the point made by Mr. McBrien in particular has some force. What we do depends on what the Minister says, which is not often the situation, I can assure him.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important to stress that the difficulty with the provisions as currently drafted is that the burden will fall, not on the whole of the industry, but disproportionately on part of the industry—approximately 32 per cent. of it. That is where the unfairness lies. As the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged, the burden falls disproportionately on some of the mutual companies. That is the unfairness which my hon. Friend and I are trying to tackle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I believe that the hon. Gentleman has had something to do with the law in the past, as have I. In a court of law one could spend many happy hours earning large fees arguing about such matters.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman may know, there are many mutual companies based in my constituency, so I understand the argument and am not unsympathetic to it, but it raises a matter of principle which the Minister, who is charged with making decisions on such matters, will have to address. If the principle of retrospection is breached we have to be careful about where that will lead us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Blackpool, South and for Beaconsfield for their clarity in speaking to the amendments, the detail of which I shall turn to in a moment.<br><br>
A Finance Bill Standing Committee is never the same without a debate on retrospection. It would not be appropriate to launch into a long polemic on the subject when dealing with the amendments, but the debate seems to be a hardy annual with Finance Bills. Very often we have to respond to problems that are drawn to our attention by accountants and lawyers and which, unless relieved, would have a damaging impact.<br><br>
I remember that the first time that I served on a Standing Committee considering a Finance Bill, in 1975, I was moved to vote against my own side, having been beguiled by one Enoch Powell, who made a very powerful case against retrospection in any circumstances. Logic can often lead one to peculiar conclusions, as certainly happened to Mr. Powell on other issues. That may have happened to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central today, as the logical extension of his argument would prevent many companies from taking advantage of a change which, were it to be imported into the Bill, would save them a great deal of money on a cost that was never anticipated.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is right to move such strictures because the Committee and the House as a whole should always be careful about passing retrospective legislation, which should always be identified as such. However, the problem to which my hon. Friends referred did not come to light until the companies involved calculated their figures for 1994. I assume that that provides the support for the case that my hon. Friends have made.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0636">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 229</span>
Paragraph 16 adds to an existing rule for dividing out the investment return from assets in computing the profits of different types of life assurance businesses, some of which are with-profits businesses, in which policyholders participate in the profits of the business by way of bonuses.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South said, two calculations are currently made. The first is by reference to the bonuses allocated to with-profits policyholders and the second is by reference to the investment return on the fund as a whole or the yield on 15-year gilts, known as the floor calculation, whichever is lower. The current rule is that the higher amount determines the tax liability and the lower amount is ignored. In future, new section 432F will provide that where the first calculation gives a higher amount than the second floor calculation for a particular class of business, any excess may be carried forward and used to reduce the allocation of investment return in any later year in which the second floor calculation would otherwise determine the tax liability for that class. The purpose of the floor rule is to secure a reasonable allocation of profit to business that is written on a non-participating, or without-profits, basis, so that there are no policyholder bonuses.<br><br>
However, the rule has the entirely unintended effect of creating a wholly excessive allocation in certain circumstances—particularly if an insurance company's actuary changes the basis of valuing the liabilities to policyholders following a rise in interest rates. The new section will correct that without doing damage to the main purpose of the rule. The change is effective from 1 January 1995. I acknowledge that that is too late for some companies. As a result of stock market and interest rate movements in 1994, many companies are having to increase the rate of interest that they use to value then-liabilities to policyholders at the end of 1994. The ABI has surveyed its members and has suggested that 13 companies will face additional tax bills of £400 million—as was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South—unless the change in paragraph 16 of the schedule takes effect in some way from 1 January 1990, when the current rule was introduced.<br><br>
I am afraid that the amendment is technically deficient. In particular, it makes no provision for transfers of insurance business between companies. An excess arising prior to a transfer would not be carried forward for set-off in a period after the transfer. At least one company needs that additional facility. However, I recognise that the changes in the schedule to the rules do not take effect soon enough for some insurers, who may therefore face unexpectedly large tax bills for 1994. We have therefore decided to introduce amendments on Report to deal with that problem.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South feels that the Government have responded to the persuasive way in which his amendment was moved. He has previously made representations on behalf of the industry. It is important that a properly drafted amendment gives effect to the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the estimated cost of the amendment? How will the Government recoup the tax that has been foregone?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We never anticipated obtaining the money as a receipt. It would have been an unexpected windfall—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
if the industry's calculations are correct—to have had an additional £400 million. We do not intend to add another £400 million on to the taxation of the life insurance industry. It was not apparent until after the figures for the industry for the year 1994 had been calculated that the problem might be a consequence of the change in the floor mechanism. There is therefore no cost that could reasonably have been anticipated. The £400 million is not part of our estimates of revenue, so there is not a cost in our official figures for offering the relief that we have announced today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for his helpful reply, and I know that those companies that are affected will be enormously relieved. I look forward with pleasure to the amendment that my hon. Friend said would be brought forward on Report. I take the point that some amendments may be needed to correct any technical deficiencies in the amendments that have been tabled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central obviously wants to make a further contribution. I suspect that the hon. Member for Blackpool, South might seek to ask leave to withdraw his amendment. I might suggest that the hon. Member for Blackpool, South does that later, so that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central can make his further observations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to allow the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central to make his comments first.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Winterton, and to the hon. Member for Blackpool, South.<br><br>
When I spoke earlier, I made it clear that we are not unsympathetic to the position in which the insurance companies find themselves. We would be sympathetic to any taxpayers who found that they had an unwelcome bill of, perhaps, half a billion pounds. Another preliminary point that I must make is that we take a neutral view on the Government's attitude to tax raising. The Government must work out what they plan to do in any financial year and how they propose to fund their plans. If the Government are willing to give up tax either by making such a concession or by other means, that is a matter for them.<br><br>
However, I want to take the Minister up on two matters in particular. The first concerns retrospection. I agree with him that it is probably not appropriate to use the amendment to have a general discussion about retrospection. Although he has given a useful and welcome concession to the industry today, others will come along and claim far bigger concessions because, they will claim, it was never intended that they should be taxed.<br><br>
I was intrigued to find out that when the Minister comes off his script and departs from his well-prepared Treasury brief, he makes a number of revelations. For example, we have already discovered that he would not hesitate for an eternity before having a single currency. I notice that the colour is only just beginning to return to the Chief Secretary's face after such a major split in his ranks. The Minister also revealed some sensible, off-the-cuff views about his general regard for Mr. Enoch Powell. I am sure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0637">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 231</span>
that most of us would welcome his qualification that, although undoubtedly Mr. Powell was a formidable arguer, some of his views were off beam and some downright obnoxious.<br><br>
Another observation that he made when he came off his script was that the problems did not come to light until the industry started to do its sums. How many other taxpayers do not discover their problems until they start doing their sums or until they start filling in their tax returns? I see hands going up among Conservative Members—perhaps we should consult <i>Erskine May</i> to find out the rules on disqualification. The Opposition shall have a majority in the Committee before the morning is out.<br><br>
When we examine our tax returns, we all wish that the tax regime were different. If that is to be the principle—when the taxpayer discovers that things are not quite right, and mindful of economic circumstances and how Finance Acts are framed, the Government consider changing the rules—that is an extremely interesting development.<br><br>
My second point is that the Minister, and therefore the Government, take the view that they were not expecting to collect the tax anyway. That view is extremely curious. One might have thought that, especially as the legislation is being amended to some extent, the Government would have had some idea about how much money they would obtain. Much of the Chancellor's speech on Budget day and much of the Chief Secretary's speech on Second Reading was directed to the fact that the Government knew how much money they would collect and how much they would spend. They knew exactly where they were. However, here we have an admission that they did not expect half a billion pounds.<br><br>
One wonders how much latitude there is in the Government's calculations, when they can spend more or give up a little tax, depending on whether it is politically expedient to do so. It is extremely odd that the Government can say that, as they did not expect the money, they can forego up to half a billion pounds—I do not think that that ABI figure is disputed at all. I am sure that if Labour members of the Committee were to suggest half a billion pounds of additional expenditure, we should never hear the end to it. The Chief Secretary would immediately jot it down and send it along to Conservative central office. However, the Conservatives have casually given away half a billion pounds, and now say that it does not matter.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), who makes cameo appearances on the Committee, may even yet be working on his dossier of our spending commitments, which nobody—not even the BBC, which carried the report so unquestionably—has seen. Had we suggested half a billion pounds of expenditure I am sure that the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives would have seized upon it. Today, however, one of the economic Ministers casually asserts that the Government were not expecting the money and would not miss it. When we question every clause and subsection, will they say, "We've got no idea how much is coming in here. Why not drop a clause here and a subsection there because we weren't expecting the money?"<br><br>
That is a slack attitude towards public finance. We are talking not about £50 or £60, but about half a billion
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
pounds. I do not begrudge the money to that group of taxpayers—most of which are mutual companies, which means that a larger group of taxpayers will benefit indirectly. However, the Minister's reasoning is curious. Would other taxpayers, who are not so acceptable to the Government, receive the same welcome as they cross the Treasury's threshold?<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
The Government need to think about these matters long and hard because they are setting a precedent that might be relied upon in future. Ministers are beginning to realise that they have reached the end of the road and are adopting a scorched-earth policy. They no longer have the firm grip on the stewardship of public finance that they once claimed to have.<br><br>
We are neutral in this matter. I do not begrudge the insurance companies gaining from not paying the tax that the Government were not expecting anyway, but other taxpayers will knock on the Treasury door and ask for the same concession. The Minister's assertion that the Government had no idea how much would have come in and, therefore, will not miss that tax is a curious argument. To how many other parts of the Bill does the same logic apply? Next time we hear the Government bawling and shouting about other people's spending commitments we shall remind them that they have given away half a billion pounds, without so much as a thought, because they had no idea that they were going to get it in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Jonathan Aitken)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Come off it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chief Secretary may say that, but it is odd that the Government should have such a casual attitude to the stewardship of public funds. We will take no lessons from them when we discuss anything that we might propose which will add to or subtract from the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a frightful meal of this matter. He has made a superficially attractive but fundamentally insignificant point. My hon. Friend the Minister answered my only concern. The amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South, which I supported, are right in principle. When it comes to retrospection, all we are really concerned about are those retrospective provisions that add to the burden of taxpayers, not those that relieve it. We have already made several retrospective changes. Clause 27 was not even discussed and yet it states that it shall
<br><blockquote><p>"be deemed always to have had effect".</p></blockquote>
We are constantly making such changes and there is no problem if they are relieving provisions. The hon. Gentleman is making too much fuss.<br><br>
I was concerned about the £450 million cost of the provision and whether that would have been an addition to the PSBR. My hon. Friend the Minister explained that that was never going to be the case as it had not been the Treasury's intention to collect that tax. Had it done so, that would have been an unexpected addition to Government revenue. I am reassured by what my hon Friend said. The commitment that he has given to the Committee is welcome.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 233</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central was the most specious attempt to have his political cake and eat it that I have ever heard. It was breathtaking in its attempt, at one and the same time, to curry favour with the insurance companies by saying that he does not really oppose the provision—he has changed his tune between his first and second speech in this short debate—while using his argument as a means of political point scoring. It will be apparent to everyone who considers the Committee's proceedings that the hon. Gentleman is failing to recognise that the measure would have been an unfair imposition on some companies, especially on policyholders in mutual companies, had it remained unchanged. The Government have recognised that a tax that they never intended to collect should not be collected. To characterise that in the specious way that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central has tried to do as giving away money is wholly unjustified. That money should never and will never come into the Government's possession.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. He seeks to curry favour with the insurance industry, but the industry will carefully weigh his words this morning and it will know that what he is really doing is signalling that any future Labour Government will try to grab large amounts of tax from insurance companies. Therefore, I counsel the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central to be far more careful with his words in future debates, both in Committee and generally, because the insurance industry will not be persuaded by his weasel words and shifting stance.<br><br>
Having said that, I welcome the indications given by my hon. Friend the Minister. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield has already said, we very much welcome the fact that the Government will correct this entirely unintended imposition on a sector of the insurance industry and on policyholders in particular, mention of whom was signally absent from the speech of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 94, in page 219, line 25, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) Where an insurance company so elects in writing within 2 years of the end of an accounting period in respect of the whole or part of the loss arising to it from its life assurance business computed in accordance with the provisions of this Act applicable to Case I of Schedule D (the Case I loss), the Case I loss shall not be reduced by the amounts specified in subsection (2)(a) above but any losses for that period under section 436,441 or 439B shall be reduced (but not below nil) by the amount of the Case I loss specified in the election and the Case I loss shall be reduced by the amount (if any) by which the amount specified in the election is lower man the amount of the losses for the period under section 436, 441 or 439B.".</p></blockquote>
I intend to try to explain the amendment without referring to the ABI brief. A life company with different sorts of business is able to set off profits and losses in each class of business. If the company makes an overall loss as a group, it can set off that loss against any profits in other group businesses. But the current law is insufficiently clear as to whether it can double count the losses. Paragraph 19 of schedule 8 deals with that problem and puts the matter beyond doubt, but the ABI suggests that it will prevent life companies from offsetting any group losses against profits of other group companies. The amendment would give companies that right, which is a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 234</span>
right that is enjoyed by any trading company that is part of a group. If it makes a loss, it is possible to transfer that loss to the profits of other group companies. That is the object of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said, companies carrying on pension business, overseas life assurance business or life reinsurance business as part of their overall life assurance business can, if they make a loss in those separate businesses, carry forward that loss and set it against the profits of those separate businesses in future years. If a company carries on basic life assurance, any excess of expenses over income can also be carried forward.<br><br>
That process is an integral feature of the way life assurance business is taxed under the so-called I—E system, where the income accruing for basic life assurance and general annuity business policyholders is taxed in the hands of the company, together with any profit the company makes on operating pension business, overseas life assurance business or life reinsurance business. On the I—E basis, the company is not taxed on the basis of the trading profit calculation that applies to most other companies. It is an anomaly that although a life insurance company is not taxed on its overall trading profit where the I—E basis applies, it can claim an overall loss on that business and reduce the tax on its other profits or on the profits of other group companies.<br><br>
That overall loss may include in it the losses made on separate parts of the business, such as the pensions business. It is clearly wrong that such a loss should be used twice, once to carry forward under the normal rules of the I—E basis, and again to be set off against any other profits of the company or to be surrendered to another group company. The provisions of paragraph 19 of schedule 8 tackle that—as my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield is aware—by preventing any loss that can be carried forward from also being used as part of an overall loss, which can be set against other profits in the same year or against those of another group company.<br><br>
The amendment proposes to allow a company to elect to reverse the order in which losses are restricted. It would allow a company to set any overall loss fully against other profits or group member's profits while restricting the carry-forward under the I—E rules. We do not believe that that would be the right way to operate.<br><br>
The I—E basis of taxation for life assurance companies is meant to be an alternative to a case I trading profit calculation. The existence of a facility to use an overall loss calculated on case I trading lines is anomalous. It can be argued that its continuing existence in any form is wrong. The measure in schedule 8 reduces its use and saves a substantial amount of tax, as a contribution to a package of measures in schedule 8 that are broadly neutral in terms of revenue. It is right that the use of an overall case I loss should be circumscribed so as to leave the I—E system operating as far as possible as it was intended to do.<br><br>
The amendment would allow unfettered use of overall case I losses. It is also technically deficient and, for that reason alone, I could not commend it to the Committee. The problem with having the reverse system or option of reliefs or carry-forward that my hon. Friend wants is that it would substantially interrupt the admittedly anomalous

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 235</span>
I—E system and the relief that can be provided. For those reasons, we do not support the amendment. I hope that, although I may disappoint my hon. Friend, I have provided him with an explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How does that compare to ordinary trading companies? If they make a loss are not they able either to carry it forward against future profits or sideways against profits to other group companies? That is all that my measure proposes. It is a matter of timing. When does one get one's loss relief? Either it can be carried forward—obviously one does not get it immediately in that case, but in a subsequent tax year—or one carries it sideways and obtains it against other group companies. I understand my hon. Friend's point about I—E or income and expenditure, which is the way in which those companies have always been taxed. Each category of business has been taxed separately on a carry-forward basis. I do not want to pursue this pretty technical matter. I do not know what its cost would be. Perhaps we should return to the matter on another occasion. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The main purpose of the amendments is to provide fair treatment between a life insurance company that specialises in reinsurance business and an ordinary life office. In schedule 8, a rule makes it clear that no capital allowances are to be given in computing the profits that an ordinary insurance company makes from its pension business, overseas life assurance business or life reinsurance business in respect of investment assets held in support of those types of business. The reason for that rule is that the way in which changes in value in the investments are taken into account in the computation effectively gives relief for any depreciation. To give capital allowances as well would amount to double relief.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
Another rule in schedule 8 changes the basis of taxing life offices that carry on only reinsurance business. They are in future to be taxed only on their trading profits and not, as previously, on the I—E basis in respect of the investment return accruing for the benefit of the underlying policyholders whose contracts and policies have been reinsured. That basis of taxation is similar to that applying to the pension business of the ordinary life office, so it is right that the same rules about capital allowances should apply. Without the amendments, pure
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 236</span>
reinsurers would enjoy more favourable tax treatment for pension and similar business, which would obviously encourage the commercially pointless reinsurance of that business for tax reasons. The pure reinsurers will be the main category of insurer affected by this change.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 152 to 155.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This and the ensuing amendments make consequential changes to the provisions in schedule 8 which introduce the new basis for taxing a pure reinsurance company on its trading profits, not on the I—E basis. Investment income, including United Kingdom and foreign income dividends, related to pension business is exempt from tax as such. But it still comes into the computation of the profit that the insurance company itself makes from writing the business. The effect is that the company pays tax on its profits, but does not pay anything on behalf of its pension business policyholders. The mechanism for UK dividends is that the company may claim payment of the tax credits attaching to the dividends but, contrary to the usual rule, the dividends and tax credits relevant to pension business are brought into the computation of the profits made from that business.<br><br>
The amendments apply that mechanism to other special rules relating to dividends to the pension business of pure reinsurers and of any other life assurance company that is, exceptionally, taxed on its trading profits. Without the amendments, the pure reinsurers would effectively get double benefit from the pension business exemption. That would obviously encourage the commercially pointless reinsurance of the business for tax reasons.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"(7) No charge shall be made under this section if no payment of a sum or sums can be made to the company under the reinsurance arrangement in respect of either surrender of a policy or contract, or in respect of either surrender of a policy or contract, or in respect of a maturity claim under a policy or contract.</p></blockquote>

Paragraph 32 of the schedule deals with reinsurance. I understand that it is a tax avoidance provision, designed to stop life companies using reinsurance to minimise their tax liability. The Association of British Insurers has suggested that the measure goes too far and could hit hardest small life companies, which have a greater need for reinsurance than larger ones. The amendment seeks to tackle that and to make it clear that genuinely commercial transactions are not caught by paragraph 32.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy with the ABI's opinion. As the Minister is in such a generous mood this morning, perhaps he will tell us whether there is any reason why the amendment should not be accepted. I agree that we should strike at measures that enable people to avoid tax, but if paragraph 32 would have an adverse effect on new entrants into the business and if the amendment does not provide a loophole for tax avoidance, it should be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield for the way in which he moved his amendment. I hope that my response will be of reasonable cheer both to my hon. Friend and to the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central, who has just expressed his support for the amendment.<br><br>
It may be helpful if I explain that paragraph 32 of schedule 8 introduces measures to prevent a serious loss of tax that has arisen through the use of reinsurance. Traditionally, reinsurance has been used by companies carrying on life assurance business to reduce exceptional mortality risks, so that they are covered if more policyholders die earlier than expected when the premium rates were calculated. That type of reinsurance does not involve a loss of tax on a company's investment return.<br><br>
However, more recently, companies have sought to reinsure investment-heavy business in such a way that neither the company nor the reinsurer pays tax on the investment income that accrues for the policyholder. Our system for taxing policyholders on gains from life assurance policies assumes that tax has been paid by the insurer on the I—E basis of investment income and chargeable capital gains less management expenses. We give policyholders a basic rate credit for the tax that an insurer is supposed to pay. It is important, therefore, to ensure that the tax is actually paid.<br><br>
Paragraph 32 introduces a new provision that will charge companies tax on the profit they make on a reinsurance contract, but the Bill contains powers to exclude by regulation particular types of business and policy.<br><br>
The Government feel that operating in that way—by power of regulation—allows more flexibility because new types of reinsurance arrangements are constantly being devised and new insurance products being developed.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 238</span>
Changes to meet new developments can be made more easily by way of regulations.<br><br>
My hon. Friend's amendment seeks to exclude from the primary legislation certain types of policy. As the representative bodies for the industry know, those types of policy feature in the draft regulations that the Inland Revenue has been discussing with the industry as ones that will generally be excluded from the operation of the new provision. Officials are discussing with the industry precisely which policies of the general type described in the amendment should be excluded, but we cannot at present, be sure that every single type of policy referred to in the amendment should be excluded.<br><br>
I would therefore urge my hon. Friend to withdraw his amendment, which would put unnecessary rigidity into the reinsurance rules, and instead suggest that the industry continues to discuss the precise scope of the exclusions to be made by regulation. If the discussions about the regulations can be concluded in time, it is the intention to publish the regulations in draft so that the industry as a whole can see precisely how they will operate.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend understands that we share the intention behind his amendment. But it is the Government's opinion—and probably the industry's, too—that it would be more appropriate to deal with any problems by regulation, which is the subject of current drafting and consultation, rather than importing the provisions—although they are reasonable—into the primary legislation. To do so would make the legislation less flexible and likely to catch aspects that it is not intended to catch.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the reasons why the Association of British Insurers may have suggested the amendment is that it was not entirely happy with the discussions on the regulations to which my hon. Friend the Minister referred. It said that it was concerned that the regulations could penalise substantial amounts of traditional reinsurance business. I appreciate and welcome what my hon. Friend has said and I hope that Inland Revenue officials, who are discussing these issues with the industry, will pay full attention to the spirit of his remarks.<br><br>
This is a difficult situation—as often occurs—in which important matters will be dealt with by regulation and we shall have no direct say in the contents of those regulations. I welcome my hon. Friend's undertaking that the regulations will be published in draft, if there is time. There should be full consultation with the industry, but my real concern is that the Inland Revenue should pay full attention to the spirit of my hon. Friend's remarks. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed.</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Eighth schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said at the start of today's proceedings, I want to make a few remarks about part II of schedule 8, which could not conveniently be addressed through an amendment, especially as we are not opposed to part II. However, it begs certain questions to which I would like answers. I anticipate that my speech will be brief, but I have no idea how many members of the Committee will want to make contributions and, therefore, I wish to apologise to the Minister and to the Committee because, due to unforeseen circumstances, I shall have to depart in about half an hour and I may not be present to hear any reply. In fact, I am going to the City—[HON. MEMBERS: "For lunch."]—to speak on the importance of the insurance industry to the United Kingdom and, if any member of the Committee would like to come with me, I shall happily expand on what I am about to say in truncated form. In any event, my hon. Friend the Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon) will take care of any loose ends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that the Committee is grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his courtesy and I am sure that the Committee understands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Darling</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad of that, Mr. Winterton. In response to the sedentary intervention about lunch, I am afraid that I shall miss lunch because I shall arrive late.<br><br>
I turn now to the schedule, part of which aims to create what is known as a level playing field in the insurance industry in Europe. There are two matters on which I am sure the Committee would welcome the Minister's comments. First, is the tax regime that we are being invited to endorse in the schedule and in other parts of the Bill being replicated elsewhere in the European Union? Secondly, if that is not the case—I believe that we are moving somewhat faster than some other European countries—what steps are the Government taking to secure open access in Europe for the UK industry?<br><br>
The financial services and insurance industry is of immense importance to the UK. The hon. Member for Blackpool, South, who is not in his place, does not need to lecture me on the importance of the financial services industry to my constituents. About 20,000 people in Edinburgh and Glasgow are employed in the life assurance industry and, therefore, it is of great importance to them. Many other towns and cities throughout the UK also depend on the industry. It is important and in all our interests that the Government do everything, in conjunction with the industry, to ensure that the industry can sell into Europe as well as other parts of the world.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
Comments from various companies lead me to believe that they do not regard Europe as the sort of marketplace that they want to enter or are likely to be able to enter because of certain perceived restrictive practices, with which I shall deal shortly. In particular, I was struck by an article last summer that quoted Mr. Mick Newmarch, whom members of the Committee no doubt remember from happier times before he left the Prudential Corporation. That company looks to the Asia Pacific
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 240</span>
markets—we are keen that they do—in preference to European markets. I spoke to representatives of several insurance companies—not over lunch, but at other meetings—who all explained that the European market is difficult to penetrate. That is partly for historical reasons. In France or Germany, for example, the market is dominated by existing providers and there is little incentive to switch. It is difficult to persuade people to change from a French or German company to a British firm unless there is some clear advantage.<br><br>
Some people believe other reasons make it difficult to penetrate the European market. On regulation, the schedule contains a number of deregulatory measures, but are they replicated elsewhere? There is a suspicion that many European countries embrace the single European market in theory but not in practice. That theme runs through all sorts of matters European, not just the financial services industry, and is causing the Government particular problems from the Eurosceptics. I am broadly well-disposed towards Europe, but I have some sympathy with those who say that, although we have an open market, some markets—to paraphrase George Orwell—are more open than others.<br><br>
Britain is genuinely moving towards an open market, which is why an increasing number of companies based in continental Europe that deal in insurance and other financial services have opened offices here, formed subsidiaries or merged with British companies and started to trade here. That is how it should be, but I want the same situation in Europe. What is the Government's view of what is happening in Europe? What are they doing on our behalf in respect of any regulatory or tax barriers? If we are to be at the heart of Europe—as the Prime Minister said four years ago, when he took over as leader of the Conservative party and Prime Minister—the Government ought to be in Europe arguing on behalf of British companies, just as hard and enthusiastically as other member states do for their companies.<br><br>
The Minister, unlike some of his colleagues on the Treasury Front Bench, is a Euroenthusiast and I could almost dictate his reply. I am sorry that I will not be present to hear it, but I shall hear it ringing in my ears as I drive away from Westminster. I hope that he will address the point because there is a feeling that some member states still have regulations that make it difficult for market penetration by British companies. There is no reason for that. If we adopt the schedule, particularly part II, to deregulate in the British market, surely the provisions ought to be replicated elsewhere. Without taking us on a tour of all the capitals of Europe, it would be helpful if the Minister will say what progress is being made. I am not alone in being concerned that certain provisions—known as the general good provisions—within the general corpus of European law allow companies to maintain regulations to protect the home industry. In practice, such regulations for the general good of the domestic market make it difficult for outsiders to enter the supposedly open market.<br><br>
We are also being invited to endorse a number of taxation measures in the schedule—we shall come to clauses 47 to, I think, clauses 51 or 52 this afternoon—which change our tax regime to facilitate the single market. We have no philosophic objection to that provided that it is mirrored in other member states. I am not sure that it is. Can the Minister confirm that? We
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0642">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 241</span>
should not act unilaterally if there is not a definite sign that similar measures will be enacted elsewhere. It is important, both on a regulatory basis and for tax purposes, that we receive an assurance that other member states are making the necessary changes to their regimes so that we do not get a lopsided single market in which Britain has an open market but others do not.<br><br>
Schedule 8 also contains measures relating to regulation in which the object is to remove restrictions. If the Department of Trade and Industry is to play a lesser role in assessing the solvency of companies, in particular those based elsewhere, who will police such matters? That is important and needs to be emphasised. You, Mr. Winterton, and members of the Committee know that we are not without our troubles in the United Kingdom in trying to police the life assurance industry. Although the industry has generally been extremely beneficial, there have been problems, especially with pension transfers.<br><br>
Under existing law, companies can use the passport system, which means that by relying on regulation in their home base they can trade in other European countries. In theory, that is good, but what guarantee is there that, first, the passporting system is being policed and, secondly and more fundamentally, that all European states police their industries to the high standards that we would want?<br><br>
In this country, slowly but surely we are making improvements after a shaky start. Opposition Members have expressed great concern about the concept of self-regulation, although this is not the place to develop our argument. Despite that concern, it would be wrong not to acknowledge that there have been some welcome changes. Regulatory regimes in some parts of Europe are elementary. If we are to have an open market, to encourage people to make provision for themselves and to buy products, and to allow fair competition between British companies and those on the continent, there must be genuinely fair competition on the much sought after level playing field.<br><br>
I am generally well disposed towards an extension of the European market and of Europe as a whole, but I am worried—perhaps because the Government is sending the wrong signals to their European partners now that the Eurosceptics are calling all the shots—that the Government are not having as much influence as they should. The Minister should deal with such matters so that we obtain genuine competition.<br><br>
The same problem arises with other legal controls—I have already mentioned general the so-called good restrictions—that make it difficult for British companies to get into the European market and to operate alongside their European competitors. Odd restrictions exist, such as those restricting the hours in which claims can be settled, and the way in which claims have to be presented. Local tax and legal conditions also make it difficult for companies to compete. Different tax regimes are in operation and we are a long way off having a uniform tax system—I am not even sure such a system is desirable. In order to ensure that there is a single market, there must be some convergence. Can the Minister tell us in which direction we and other European countries are going?<br><br>
I am not entirely convinced that what we are doing is being mirrored elsewhere in the European Union. British companies are in a good position to compete throughout the world and many of them are doing so. There is much
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
untapped potential in the Asia Pacific markets and perhaps also in Latin America. We must be careful to avoid in Europe the absurd situation where companies in other member states have protectionism at home and a free market in Britain. If the single market is to develop, and if the public largely continue to support developments in Europe, the European market must be shown to be genuinely open, so that British companies can compete alongside other companies on fair and equal terms.<br><br>
The Opposition welcome much of schedule 8, although we have various reservations. For instance, when we debate clause 49, I shall discuss policing and solvency, which will take us to regulatory matters. It would be wrong for us to nod through schedule 8 without bothering to question whether Britain's reforms were being mirrored elsewhere in Europe. I have every confidence that the Minister will reply to my remarks—probably in a way that I can predict. I hope that he will take my questions seriously. Perhaps other conservative Members will not want to show their true colours, lest the divisions in the Conservative party spill through into the Committee. I am sure that members on both sides of the Committee are worried that lopsided openness may result—that should be avoided at all costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get involved with the details of schedule 8. However, I might invite members of the Committee to read it, and the Minister to explain the effect of each of the amendments, one by one. If that were done, at some stage in the middle of next year the Committee might finish its sitting.<br><br>
I must comment on the drafting of schedule 8, which contains 27 pages. I have done only a quick check, but it covers the Taxes Act 1988, the Taxes Management Act 1970, the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, the Finance Act 1994, the Finance Act 1989 and the Capital Allowances Act 1990. I am sure that other Acts are mentioned that I have missed. If one assumes that the schedule will amend five pieces of legislation for each of its pages—which is a modest estimate—we should have to deal with roughly 135 amendments. Frankly, if one reads the schedule, none of the amendments makes sense—the only way,to understand it is to try to understand each and every Act that is referred to. For instance, paragraph 16 of the schedule refers to sections without attempting to explain time. It would be extraordinarily difficult to understand their effect without consulting the original legislation. Would not it have been possible to have given members of the Committee what would be, in effect, a consolidation of all of the provisions of the 27-page schedule? That would help members of the Committee and anyone else who has to try to understand the Bill. We could see in one document what the Government are trying to achieve.<br><br>
The schedule is so complicated that clause 45, which we have discussed, is devoted to summarising it. I should be interested in the legal impact of that description, which serves only as a signpost to what is contained in schedule 8. What if part II of the schedule contains general rather than specific amendments? The strange drafting of clause 45 was necessary only because of the complexity of the schedule. We should have been given a consolidation of the schedule, so that we could see in one document what we are discussing.</span></p>

<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Warwickshire, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The insurance industry is important. I am a member of the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee, which has been considering the question of City regulation. One begins to appreciate the large numbers of people employed in the City and the importance to the British economy of financial services generally and the insurance industry in particular. The insurance industry produces 12 per cent. of GDP and employs 2.6 million people—a figure that has increased by 39 per cent. since 1983.<br><br>
We are dealing with a matter of great importance which we need to encourage. The UK has historically been a leader in the provision of such services. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central said that we have had some problems with pension transfers and with the reinsurance industry at Lloyd's, which the Select Committee is currently investigating, but despite those difficulties there are good standards. We need to ensure that standards are maintained at the highest level throughout the European Union when we move further into the single market and that British companies are able to exploit existing opportunities. No doubt we shall see companies from other countries coming into our market and expanding its capacity, thereby reducing costs for the consumer.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister can give an answer today to the two central questions put by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central. Is the tax regime in the UK mirrored in other EU countries? What steps are the Government taking to ensure open access to Europe for the UK insurance industry? There are clearly substantial difficulties facing British companies that are doing so. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield mentioned his concerns about the general agreement on tariffs and trade, but even within the EU there are many restrictive practices which will cause difficulties for our companies.<br><br>
Francois Lohéac, the general secretary of a representative body of the European insurance industry, said that it would need "a veritable revolution" for Italy and Germany to integrate properly into a single market in insurance. He suggested that those countries might well be the slowest to integrate because they have cartel-like arrangements that inhibit outside competition trying to come into their area. Nevertheless, it is clear that they are interested in entering our area. Since 1986, Allianz of Germany has been involved with Cornhill Insurance. It is anxious to enter the market here, but will we have the opportunity to do so there?<br><br>
We need specific answers from the Government on the various difficulties that immediately present themselves. The incidence of claims, for example, varies widely across the EU. Different levels of road safety give rise to different levels of risk for the insurance industry. The industry must be able to take on board all those spheres of information. Are the Government ensuring proper access for the insurance industry to information about laws in other countries or are they leaving it to others?<br><br>
Different national courts have different attitudes on the size of awards given to personal injury victims—that would also have an impact on insurance. To what extent are the Government trying to promote harmonisation among EU countries on approaches to such matters? Such
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
harmonisation would be enormously welcome in a single market.<br><br>
I was reading a newspaper article last night, the contents of which struck me as odd. It said that in other countries, different services are expected of brokers. In Belgium, for example, brokers are expected to turn up in the middle of the night if necessary to pay up on an agreed claim. We would not expect that in this country, indeed, we might be alarmed by a knock on the door in the middle of the night, but that is the way insurance brokers are expected to behave in Belgium. That sort of behaviour incurs an overhead that must be paid for. If we want to provide services in Belgium, are we expected to take on such overheads? Obviously, the insurance industry must consider those factors.<br><br>
Will Government in Belgium and other countries place any legal obstructions on the sorts of services that must be provided to inhibit our companies' ability to enter foreign markets, charge the lowest price for their services and reap the best possible profits for our industry?<br><br>
I started by talking about the differing tax systems, but member states can still limit the scope of tax advantages for some life insurers. At what stage are the negotiations for harmonising taxation?<br><br>
Cultural factors also inhibit trade. Some countries have very closed systems, with long-term loyal relationships having developed between particular brokers and their customers. Such relationships are part of the cultural make-up of the countries and breaking into them will be enormously difficult. Advice from the Department of Trade and Industry, and encouragement and tax incentives from the Treasury are important in ensuring that cultural factors are not allowed to inhibit our industry's ability to take advantage of the available opportunities.<br><br>
Mr. Tony Baker, the deputy director general of the Association of British Insurers, has expressed concern about the various methods of obstructing our ability to enter European Union markets. He is concerned that in intra-European Union trade British companies may be restricted to specialised niches, such as sophisticated investment policies for wealthy individuals. That is not the big opportunity for which we hope. The Government must address those concerns, not only by changing the tax regime so that the British system assists our companies but by ensuring that opportunities are available to those companies which we are encouraging to enter new markets.<br><br>
I now turn to developing my earlier point about standards and ensuring that the customers of insurance businesses operating in this country which come from the European Union can take advantage of our market. Those companies must comply with the highest standards, which must be operated by British companies in the European Union. We must not allow any lowering of standards. Because the purpose of schedule 8 is to encourage insurance companies to enter the European Union markets, we must know how standards are to be maintained for the customer in this country—who will, perhaps, be dealing with companies that are unused to our standards of insurance behaviour—and how to ensure that the standards that our companies adopt in Europe are of the highest quality.<br><br>
Many mergers have been or are being contemplated and some have already been completed—Allianz and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0644">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 245</span>
Cornhill Insurance joined up in 1986, and Commercial Union has allied with Group Victoire. Such ventures are welcome in that they expand the market's capacity to offer competition, leading to lower prices and better services, but we must ensure that standards are maintained. I hope that the Minister will be able to assure us that a proper and effective system of regulation will be put in place in the United Kingdom—although I am not convinced that we have got it right in the United Kingdom—and that there will be a European regime, with bases in each member state tailored to that country's regulations, which incorporates the best standards from the whole of the European Union. That is important because if we encourage our companies to go into the EU, we must ensure that their standards and reputation are maintained and also that when companies from Europe come into this country, customers who buy financial products from them can be assured that the standards that they are used to in the insurance industry are maintained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise very briefly to say that I made the mistake of listening to the speech of the hon. Member for Ashfield. The more fairly I tried to listen to his speech, the more I agreed with him on his essential point that schedule 8 is almost as large as some Bills. I am alarmed, as is the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which I advise, by the gathering complexity of Finance Bill legislation year in, year out. This is one more example of that.<br><br>
Speaking as a Member of Parliament and as an adviser to the Institute of Chartered Accountants, I urge my hon. Friend and his officials to consider carefully the practical suggestion of the hon. Member for Warwickshire, North (Mr. O'Brien) for a consolidation measure and also whether some of the arguments that were made on the Floor of the House and elsewhere for a different procedure for considering the highly technical matters in finance legislation are being resurrected. The schedule would benefit from a period of invigilation and investigation by a Committee that is able to do so in greater detail than we are able or inclined to do in present circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denis MacShane <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rotherham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to follow the two previous speakers because the complexity and depth of the schedule shows us the complexity and depth of our relationship with Europe. Very few European countries would have such a complicated law to deal with this matter. A moment of truth is approaching if not for the Committee, then for the House and the country on what sort of relationship we want with Europe. I was interested to read the comment by the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill) that a single currency is incompatible with conservatism. He is absolutely right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am afraid that that matter has absolutely nothing to do with the debate on schedule 8.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall return to schedule 8 very quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No the hon. Gentleman will not—he must do so straight away. We are discussing schedule 8 stand part.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 246</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton.<br><br>
Schedule 8 is all about Europe and the way in which European insurance companies can operate in this country and, we hope, British-based companies can operate in Europe. I have a specific question for the Minister. I draw his attention to an example on page 212 where new section 431E(2)(d) requires
<br><blockquote><p>"companies to supply information and make available books, documents and other records for inspection on behalf of the Board".</p></blockquote>
Nowhere in the schedule is it stated—I doubt whether it is stated anywhere in the Bill—that that information should be provided in English. I note that those on the Treasury Front Bench are raising their eyebrows. The plain fact is that the assumption that the inner workings of Zurich, Allianz and other insurance companies are available in English—that their "books, documents and other records" can be made available in English—is not enacted in the legislation. Those companies, which operate under their own internal rules and laws, are extremely complex. I foresee a time when a British person who is insured with them wants to take up some case not only in those courts but in courts in other European countries in the Union or, in due course, the European Court of Justice, and that the case will require the information to be made available in English.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
Other European countries experience the same problem. We are examining the different ways in which other cultures deal with insurance. Germany, for example, is a wholly, compulsorily insured society. In Britain, some aspects of insurance are compulsory and governed through the state, such as a minimum level of car insurance and road tax, but in many other aspects it is wholly voluntary. The Chief Secretary, who has left the Room, was quoted today as saying that people should take out insurance for legal aid protection. He cited the case of Germany. He is right that Germany handles £1.13 billion of legal aid insurance a year, compared with £75 million—a trifling sum—in this country. I do not have the clipping in front of me, but the figures are more or less accurate.<br><br>
The Chief Secretary, made a valid point, but the difference is that many more disputes which in our country would be settled by arbitration and non-legal forms of settlement are in Germany handled through a myriad of small courts that operate under clear codes of laws and are not settled by "my learned friends" jumping up with their wigs on and clocking up their barristers' fees. The more we examine the schedule the more we find a case for simplification.<br><br>
I would like a response to my question about language. I draw attention to early-day motion 598 on the Order Paper today, which highlights that the Prime Minister is not capable of obtaining adequate translations in German or French for interventions that he chooses to make in the House.<br><br>
Finally, in comparing Britain with other European countries—and when our country is responsible and generous enough to amend our law to bring it into line with European directives—we may inadvertently but with good European intentions make our people vulnerable to companies that do not fully respect, in a responsible way, the insurance conditions of the United Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman) that there is a danger of undue unanimity breaking out in the Committee as I entirely agree with the remarks made by the hon. Members for Ashfield and for Warwickshire, North.<br><br>
Will my hon. Friend the Minister comment on a problem that is already arising from the construction of artificial tax havens that deal with the sort of business that we discussed under the schedule? I cite the case of Dublin dock, where business can be transacted in a way that could lead not only to tax avoidance but to unscrupulous tax evasion, which would deprive all Governments throughout the Community of revenues that rightfully should be theirs. Have the Government made representations in the Council of Ministers about the creation of potential tax evasion centres? Can my hon. Friend the Minister estimate the loss of business to legitimate insurance companies in this country through the operation of that tax haven?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to echo several points, but most specifically that made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West. The creation of centres such as Dublin dock has been of considerable concern to the UK insurance industry. I hope that our hon. Friend the Minister will be able to respond to my hon. Friend's points.<br><br>
My final plea echoes comments made by several hon. Members about the tremendous complexity of the schedule. We know that the issues are not simple, but I urge those on the Treasury Front Bench to try, if they can, to introduce as much simplicity as possible into this necessarily complex matter when they construct future Finance Bills. Undoubtedly, there are dangers of further lacunae creeping into complex schedules; those will need further debate and further correction in future years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful debate on the complexities, content and intent of schedule 8. I am disappointed, though not offended, that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central cannot be here because he had to leave early for lunch in the City. That is clearly part of the continuing prawn offensive. However, it is surprising that he chose today of all days to make amorous approaches to the City. I suspect that it might turn out to be a bit of a Valentine's day massacre if he parades before it the Labour party's proposals for banking in the City.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The City is making amorous advances to my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central has pretensions to be the darling of the City, but he will be confounded—both today and in the future.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beasonsfield asked me about the general agreement on trade services. The Government and I attach enormous importance to the successful conclusion of the negotiations on that. Members of the Committee will be aware that at the end of the Uruguay round we failed to reach agreement on financial services, trade and access worldwide. From the beginning of this calendar year, with the establishment of the World Trade Organisation, a further period of six
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 248</span>
months was allowed to enable countries to come forward with liberalisation proposals and for countries to secure agreement on most favoured nation treatment. The United Kingdom, which has a great national self-interest in access to and freedom of financial services, trade and business internationally, is in the vanguard of those pressing within Europe and elsewhere for a successful conclusion to the negotiations.<br><br>
The problem remains that some countries—in particular, those in emerging markets—have failed to offer sufficient liberalisation. Sadly, the United States, for reasons that we understand though regret, is threatening to seek exemption at the end of that period. That runs the risk of countries in the European Union also seeking exemption and of dismantling and unwinding many of the liberalisation proposals. The consequences for our country and the great financial services industries within it of missing the opportunity to access the great developing and emerging financial markets all around the globe will be serious for many years. That is why a number of Ministers, myself included, are making strenuous efforts—and will continue to do so in the remaining mondis—to secure further offers of liberalisation and to encourage other countries to accept what will be on the table at the end of that process, even if it does not include everything that they wanted, and to secure agreement on the general agreement on trade in services.<br><br>
That overview relates to some of the questions asked on schedule 8. The hon. Members for Edinburgh, Central and for Warwickshire, North asked specifically whether the tax regime in schedule 8 is to be replicated elsewhere in the European Union and what steps are being taken to secure access to the insurance market elsewhere in the European Union. The third life insurance directive and third non-life insurance directive will provide for home state authorisation and regulation of insurance businesses. By providing, as in other areas of financial services, a passport within the single market to be able to offer services cross-border, that should provide for guarantees and common security of regulation to meet, certain minimum standards as set out in the directive.<br><br>
As with the investment services directive and the second banking co-ordination directive, the intention with insurance is to have a minimum standard of assurance and regulation provided for under the directive which individual member states have to implement through domestic legislation. If they fail to do so, they run the risk of infraction proceedings instituted by the European Commission—which must be the policeman—to ensure that member states implement the terms of the directive and that there is not an unlevel playing field with some subscribing to the rules and being prejudicially treated because other countries fail to do so. It is primarily the responsibility of the Commission to implement directives and, in so doing, it should bring a reality to the single market in insurance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way on the issue of mutual recognition. The directives rely on the supervisory authorities in other member states to act effectively to control the insurance industry within their countries. Such supervision costs insurance companies money. If other countries fail properly to supervise their insurance companies, UK companies could find themselves at a cost disadvantage. The European Commission acts only on complaints made by a member
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0646">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 249</span>
state and tends otherwise not to supervise activities. How will the Government ensure that other countries maintain the standards that he has described?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, it is primarily for the European Commission to oversee and insist on the implementation of the provisions of directives. It is supposed to monitor what member states do and the Council of Ministers should call it to account if it does not. Member states have to demonstrate to the Commission what they are doing and it is not unknown for the Commission to approach member states if they fail to do so and ask what they intend to do about it.<br><br>
Member states can bring pressures to bear on the Commission. The Department of Trade and Industry has responsibility for insurance matters and if it had a complaint on behalf of the British industry it could be expected to draw the matter to the attention of the Commission. However, official redress is not the only issue here; there is also the possibility of what I believe are known as Frankovitch damages, which are payable when somebody suffers financially quantifiable damages as a result of the non-implementation of a European directive.<br><br>
I readily acknowledge that there are different timings, as well as records of implementation of European directives, and that is rightly a matter on which all legislators should ask Governments to be vigilant and to make representations to the European Commission. That is how it should and, by and large, does work. Certainly, in the United Kingdom, where we tend to observe Queensberry rules on such matters, we have a good record of implementation in this and in other areas. Generally speaking, the legislation opens opportunities and creates access for British life assurance companies.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
On the issue raised by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central as to whether certain provisions allow countries to escape from the intent of directives by means of the "general good" clause, I should say that this is mostly about advertising. Indeed, in the United Kingdom, we have taken some advantage of this provision with regard to direct selling. The Committee will know that there has been concern about direct selling from one country into another, particularly concern about selling certain financial services and advertisements offering questionable products. We have taken advantage of the general good clause by introducing restrictions on that. It can work to protect policyholders, as well as working to their disadvantage, but we believe that it is a protection rather than a restraint of trade.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that connection, will my hon. Friend comment on the dangers that will arise and are already arising with computer networks and what is called selling in cyberspace?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To be honest, I cannot. Ministers are supposed to be all-knowing, but, unless inspiration arrives in the next minute or two, I shall have to write to my hon. Friend or discuss the matter with him separately, if it is in my remit.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ashfield, like my hon. Friends the Members for Carshalton and Wallington and for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 250</span>
Blackpool, South, raised the question of the complexity of the schedule. I freely acknowledge that the schedule is an especially lengthy one. It covers several complex areas and, in some places, the draftsmen have found that the best way to make changes has been to rewrite the existing law. We hope that experts in this somewhat arcane area will think that this is an improvement, even though no substantive changes to the law have been made. In other words, there has been some clarification for the technicians who require it.<br><br>
The problem, which is well-known to members of the Committee, is a perennial one: the Treasury seeks to protect the revenue, but industry relies on the letter of the law and, in order to prevent substantial and costly avoidance, one must sometimes tie things up with legalistic certainty to protect that revenue.<br><br>
On the other hand, there is the wholly compelling argument that legislation should, as far as possible, be written in simple English and easy to understand. The hon. Member for Ashfield complained, in a way that my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) has done on previous occasions, about the complexity of drafting in Finance Bills and said that this is not understandable without some sort of comprehensive or consolidating explanation. The Government tried to assist by sending members of the Committee explanatory notes to the schedule, although I readily admit that they are themselves fairly impenetrable, unless one has a doctorate in the subject.<br><br>
I have immersed myself in the subject for a few days and claim to know a little about it. It is a complex area, but, in striking the right balance between certainty of the law and comprehension of the law, the strictures of the Committee, that we must try to make legislation simple and understandable, will always be borne in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend considered the fact that briefer and broader language would be perfectly adequate for the protection of the revenue? A likely consequence of that, I admit, would be that matters would have to go to court more often, but at least that would simplify the complexity in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's suggestion is appealing, in particular, to Ministers but also to hon. Members. However, in the real world, the Government are pressured constantly for clarity and certainty about the impact of our legislation. When costly tax obligations arise, there has to be certainty. I accept that the life insurance industry needs to know where it stands with regard to the reliefs and tax liabilities that we have discussed today. However, it would not be satisfactory to leave the matter open for interpretation in a series of legal cases, which would gradually attach a meaning to the legislation. It is for the House to decide what it wants, particularly on tax matters—it is for the Government to propose and the House to dispose. If the Government were to set down broad guidelines about how the system should operate, and leave the rest up to the courts, it would be extremely difficult for the courts, extremely uncertain for the world outside, and extremely problematic for the revenue.<br><br>
I do not wish to dismiss the points that have been made by members of the Committee. The review by the Institute for Fiscal Studies is studying the issue, and has got the Government's support for doing that. If there were a way forward, I should be in the vanguard of those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0647">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 251</span>
supporting it. However, the problems seem to get worse year by year.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane) discussed section 431E(d), which relates to the reports that are associated with overseas life assurance business. His question may have been predicated on a misunderstanding. The section is not about overseas companies; it is about the overseas life assurance business of United Kingdom companies, which produce reports in the English language. The section deals with the business that is offered, and the policies that are sold, abroad, which is called the overseas life assurance business. The question does not arise of imposing a requirement on non-British companies to make reports about their affairs. The question of language does not arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. MacShane</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seized on that point only as an example. Generally, there are requirements to report on companies that will be allowed to operate in the United Kingdom insurance market. Does the Bill—or does tax legislation generally—contain the requirement that those companies should provide all relevant documents in English, including company statutes? They may contain quite complicated information about a company that is located in Germany, France, Belgium or elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am aware, and unless I have misunderstood the situation, it goes without saying that we do not have laws that place requirements on non-British companies in this regard. Therefore, the requirements in law—whether in the Bill or other legislation—that relate to British companies that have reporting requirements are in English. However, I do not want to get on to the subject of whether English is the common language. We have debated common currency for long enough this morning. As far as I am aware, the hon. Gentleman's point is not a problem.<br><br>
My hon. Friends the Members for Bournemouth, West and for Blackpool, South discussed the question of Dublin dock and tax havens. Yes, of course, the Government would be worried if the establishment and growth of tax havens in parts of the European Union acted as magnets for funds and activity that detracted from elsewhere in the European Union. However, that should not be occurring, whether in Dublin dock or, for example, in Gibraltar, which some say has certain tax advantages, but is annexed to the European Union.<br><br>
In regard to the life assurance industry in particular, a business operating on a gross roll-up basis out of Dublin dock is not necessarily any different from a gross roll-up life assurance operated elsewhere in the European Union. We use the I—E basis for taxing life assurance funds during their lifetime, and when they mature they are given back to the policyholder free of tax.<br><br>
Other European countries offer differential systems: Denmark and Norway operate some form of tax investment on roll up; Ireland and Sweden use a similar I—E basis for their taxation. We shall monitor this issue carefully, because it affects directly the competitiveness and size of and opportunities in our domestic markets.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not only the gross roll-up basis that causes concern. The gross roll-up basis combined with the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 252</span>
absence of capital gains tax on the end result gives a double tax advantage, which could lead to considerable problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are provisions under our law to tax the maturing sum, whether it emanates from Dublin dock or from elsewhere. It should not be possible to avoid paying United Kingdom tax by investing in a gross roll-up fund, although tax will not be paid during the existence of the roll-up of that life assurance investment fund. When the sum matures and is payable to the policyholder, whether it emanates from Dublin dock or from elsewhere in the European Union, that sum will be liable for tax in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
I tried to answer the points raised to the best of my ability. I hope that hon. Members are satisfied with my answers and that the Committee will agree to schedule 8.</span></p>

Clause 46</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
MEANING OF "INSURANCE COMPANY"</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hoon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 46 has been written in response to the third life and non-life insurance directives, which came into force in July last year. Where clause 46 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"there shall be substituted the following definition",</p></blockquote>
it would have been helpful if there were a definition of an insurance company apparent on the face of the Bill. Then we would have understood more clearly what the clause refers to. A definition of an insurance company is a fairly basic provision as it is central to the directives and to this part of the Bill, and it would have been helpful to have it appear in the Bill, rather than to have it referred to as part of the Insurance Companies Act 1982.<br><br>
Although I accept that "EC company" is a legally proper description of material relating to the single market, I wonder whether the Government have difficulty using what is a much more acceptable phrase nowadays, which is "European Union company". Although it is not technically incorrect to draft the Bill in this way, it would make far more sense to refer to the European Union. I am sure that the omission does not arise from any sort of Government phobia about these matters, but a degree of consistency would be welcome in future.<br><br>
I have one more observation. I am led to believe that the clause applies also to Iceland and Norway. If that is the case, will the Minister explain why those two particular countries, in addition to the European Union member states, are covered by this provision?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend say why it is necessary to have at least three definitions of an insurance company in the Taxes Acts. The Taxes Act 1988 contains one definition, the Finance Act 1993 another, and a further one appears in the Finance Act 1994. Why cannot an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0648">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 253</span>
insurance company be an insurance company?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nelson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The definition of insurance companies is, indeed, set out in other documents, not least the overriding EC directive. It is also mentioned in the Taxes Act 1988. There are different sorts of insurance business and different parts of the law may apply to different aspects of the insurance industry. That may go some way to explaining why the definition changes slightly in different pieces of legislation. There was never any
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 254</span>
intention to confuse readers of the Bill by not including a specific definition.<br><br>
As for the phrase, "European Union", we have no phobia about that. The views of Conservative Members on the Committee are indivisible on that issue.</span></p>
