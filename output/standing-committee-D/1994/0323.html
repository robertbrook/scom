	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lewis Moonie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kirkcaldy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An anticipatory reference, which I am sure is wholly justified—if not yet correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an apparent mistake in the composition of the Committee—the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Jackson) has not been included on the Government side. That must be an oversight on their part because he is, after all, the hon. Member representing more than 3,000 of the employees concerned, has a long-standing interest in the area and is a former science Minister. His expertise would have illuminated the Government Benches, if not those of the Opposition. One member of the Committee who has to serve on two Committees, to his great anxiety and strain. It would have helped the general good working of this Committee had the hon. Member for Wantage been included. Perhaps the Government could cast some light on that bizarre situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That matter is not for me but for the Committee of Selection. We will have to go ahead with the Committee as is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. Adequate notice should be given on amendments. As a general rule, my fellow Chairman, Mr. O'Hara, and I do not intend to call starred amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Industry and Energy (Mr. Richard Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clause 1; Schedule 1; Clauses 2 to 6; Schedule 2; Clauses 7 and 8; Schedule 3; Clauses 9 to 13; new Clauses; new Schedules.</p></blockquote>
It makes sense to consider the schedules with the relevant clauses. For example, schedule 1 is an elaboration and development of clause 1, and clause 6 simply gives effect to schedule 2. At this stage, the only new schedule we have tabled is the tax schedule, as my right hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Industry said on 14 March, on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 8, leave out "or schemes".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 2, in page 1, line 9, leave out "any person or persons" and insert "the successor company".

No. 5, in page 1, line 22, leave out "person or persons" and insert "successor company".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 6, in page 1, line 23, leave out "or include one or more companies".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: AEA Technology is important to the nuclear industry—for which it carries out an enormous volume of research—and to the country, because of the range and type of activities in which it is involved. In view of its strategic importance, the Government should consider changing their initial suggestion that a scheme or schemes be set up to facilitate the sell-off of AEA Technology. Amendment No. 2 would remove the words "person or persons" from clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
AEA Technology would benefit greatly from being sold off—if it must be sold off—as a single entity rather than as a succession of smaller, single companies. I will briefly state the reasons for that view. It is a generally held assumption that a larger company is better than a group of smaller companies. There are constraints on that suggestion, but it holds for a company of the size that we are considering. For example, larger companies gain advantages in raising capital by virtue of their bigger muscle. They have greater synergy, and a wider range of activities and complementary skills among their work forces. A wide variety of sources have provided advice on the issue and I have a morass of papers to support our view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, I referred to an editorial in the 	<i>Financial Times</i>—which, incidentally, supported privatisation. It stated that the ideal solution to AEA Technology's sale—
	<br><blockquote><p>"must be a management buy-out. This would create a sense of partnership among the company's employees, and guarantee the AEA the independence to underpin its credibility as a consultancy.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The alternative would be flotation as a private company. This would not be easy, however, since investors would have to be sure that the AEA had a worthwhile portfolio of contracts, and that its principal assets—people—would not walk out of the door.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Only as a last resort should the Government consider the remaining option: sale in whole or in part to trade purchasers. This would be highly unsatisfactory. The AEA would lose its independence and, if broken up, its range of skills as well."</p></blockquote>
That is also the view of the trade unions that represent the majority of employees within AEA Technology and I believe that it is also the generally held view of its management. The Government would be well advised to heed that advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
AEA Technology is a major research and consultancy group. It is the largest company of its kind in this country and one of the largest in the world dealing with decommissioning and research on nuclear facilities and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
materials. During the past few years it has grown and diversified. There can be no argument about that, and it is a good thing. It is a model for many other agencies in the Government sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Depending on how one defines research and development, AEA Technology could, as a single entity, be listed in the top 20 British companies in terms of the volume of research and development that it undertakes. I cannot understate the value of that research and development to this country. The Government must not do anything that will prejudice the ability of AEA Technology to compete successfully in its chosen fields and to continue to grow and diversify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is still a major player in the nuclear industry. It works to improve the performance of nuclear reactors as well as the performance and longevity of plants and processors. Its processor technology has applications in many other areas and in turn, AEA's work is of great relevance to the oil and gas industries, where these technologies can be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
AEA plays a major role in establishing the safety of nuclear sites. The situation in the world being what it is, it also has a major worldwide role to play. In eastern Europe it provides help to run existing nuclear installations and to decommission those due for that process. There is a range of such activities. They have in common that they are complementary to each other. From one piece of core technology, another one, two or three activities spin off and can be used to generate wealth. As a result, a clear assumption can be made that it would be better to keep AEA as a single entity, rather than to break it up and lose the present synergy between its constituent parts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other aspects of AEA Technology bear mention. It is the main Government body for environmental research. Last year it took over the operation of the Warren Spring national environmental research centre, formerly at Stevenage. It is also mentioned as the probable successful bidder for the National Physical Laboratory. I referred to these aspects on Second Reading so I do not propose to discuss them in detail. They are key national priorities and it is unthinkable that they should be split up and that their work should be lost or submerged in a break-up of AEA into its constituent parts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Warren Spring has not been absorbed into AEA Technology as a single entity. Less than 50 per cent. of its staff—far fewer than I thought—transferred to the new joint operation. That has not been kept as a single entity and subsumed into other activities of AEA Technology across a wide area of its operations. We can argue whether such an important national priority should be in the public or in the private sector, but none of us would disagree that it should be a priority of Government to see that its work on the enforcement of environmental quality standards continues. Because of the way in which Warren Spring has been absorbed into AEA Technology it is essential that the company remains as one entity to allow its work to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What if the same were to happen to the National Physical Laboratory, which is the agency responsible for standards of measurement in this country? Nowadays, we tend to take such matters for granted, but wars used to be fought over whether standards were properly applied in Europe. I am not suggesting that that would happen today,
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
but it underpins the importance of this area of work to our national interests. We should run no risk of breaking it up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
AEA Technology's value lies in its independence and its credibility as an agency that can be trusted to do the work that it is set. That depends on its size, knowledge, experience and work force. What message are we sending to the work force and to the customers of AEA Technology, on whom its future success depends, and to the management who have worked so well in the past few years to diversify and to turn AEA Technology into a successful entity that can stand on its own in the public or private sector? What message is clause 1 sending to them? It shows that the Government do not know what they are about. They would like to get rid of AEA Technology, sell it off and obtain the income—but they do not know whether they will sell it off as one part or in several little bits, some of which might be closed down. Frankly, that is not good enough. When the Government sell off an agency as important as this one, they must make their intentions clear. It is not just a matter of securing the maximum return in the shortest time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government make it clear that they will sell AEA Technology off—if it must be sold off—as a single entity and not as a group of smaller organisations, that will be good for the morale of the work force and of the management, which has to prepare the scheme. Such clarification would send a clear message to the customers of AEA Technology in this country and throughout the world. It would prevent cherry picking of the best parts of the company, and the other parts—that perhaps need a little longer to mature and give the company a sound base in other areas—would be given time to develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should make their intentions clear. That is the purpose of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the sittings motion has been accepted, I promise not to speak for as long as I did on Second Reading. The usual channels have organised matters better today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate my hon. Friend's comment that it is a pity that the hon. Member for Wantage is not with us. He raised some important points on Second Reading. I shall not recite them in detail, but refer hon. Members to columns 732–733 of 	<i>Hansard</i> for 14 March, when the hon. Gentleman set out eight reasons for the business not to be broken up into smaller companies. The principle of his argument was extremely sound.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Minister told hon. Members about AEA's core business. It was clear from the wideranging debate on Second Reading that the core business rests on AEA's scientific excellence and has become very broad. It would damage the development of that important scientific base if the company were broken up into its component parts. Some of the spin-off products that have resulted from the company's diversity would not have materialised if AEA had been broken up into small units.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No country can afford to leave nuclear safety to the market. Nuclear safety is based on several important protocols, which have been carefully developed. Several agencies have specific roles, and it would be damaging to allow the market to take over AEA's responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman arguing to split off the nuclear from the non-nuclear side of AEA Technology? As I am sure he is aware, 45 per cent. of AEA Technology's business comes from the non-nuclear side, which is growing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady had read my Second Reading speech, she would know that I argued against privatisation. If AEA is to be privatised, I am concerned that some of the extremely successful non-nuclear parts of the business that have spun off as a result of work in the science community, which is directly related to the nuclear business. The synergies in the company provide powerful arguments for the Committee to consider the amendments favourably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that we are, seemingly, stuck with a decision to privatise based on ideology rather than clear logic—there seems to be widespread belief that is the case—we ought to be asking how we can best protect the British scientific base in the company and the interests of the people who work in the industry. Clearly, their morale and enthusiasm is vital to the success of British science. Given that it is national science week, perhaps we should give that issue serious consideration. If we are stuck with the ideological divide, we should at least privatise in such a way as to protect those two interests. The amendments aim to do that in a sensible fashion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Purchase 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wolverhampton, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try to set out the background to another mistake by the Government. We have to go back a considerable time to a statement by the late Nicholas Ridley about UCS Shipbuilders, to find where the drive comes from for the type of privatisation now being put before Parliament—the breaking-up and selling-off of an organisation that has shown its value and worth to our country. In 1969, at the heyday of the so-called Selsdon man, Mr. Ridley—as he then was—was heard to remark and wrote in a memo, as hon. Members will recall as they will have read it 1,000 times, that the best way to deal with UCS was to break it up and sell it off cheaply. That is exactly the plan that is before us today, dressed up in more moderate language by, I hope, more moderate people. I hope that they are moderate enough to take the amendment on merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The privatisation of AEA Technology is unnecessary. It should be left together with the whole organisation. The word "synergy" was used. I understood that to mean, in simple old-fashioned words, that the whole was greater than the sum of the parts. That has been a useful expression over many years for recognising that vertically and horizontally constructed organisations produce additional value because they work together in companies.

It has been fashionable—but is now less so, I hope—for large companies to splinter and to get pieces of business done in the private sector, for the simple reason that they thus avoid most social security charges and reduce the power of working people's organisations. Such problems cannot be resolved by avoiding them. Where difficulties arise in organisations—either because of ossification or because chains of command grow too long—they should be met head on with modern management techniques, so that people work in partnership and with a spirit of co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
The Government continue to take the short cut. They chop up, cut up and sell off cheaply. The nation made a great sacrifice in putting those organisations together—the AEA was formed by a Conservative Government whose counsel was wiser than that of the present Government. That organisation is to be broken up and sold off, and the 	<i>Financial Times</i> suggests that it will be valued at around £200 million. That is a paltry sum compared to the value of the company's work for the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could continue that work, but what will happen when it is in the private sector? The amendments make it clear that part of the problem will be that the new company will have considerable difficulty raising the investment funds that it will need to continue the work that it has done for many years. It is claimed that the markets will decide, but it is a tactic of markets to ensure that so-called profitable sectors of companies are sold off. The money that is made is then distributed to shareholders. It is as though the company and the people who worked for it never existed—it is sunk without trace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill offers no certainty about the details in the Government's mind. Plurals are used instead of singulars. It is suggested that the sale may be made to a number of companies or to one company. The Government do not know what they want. The sale is driven not by a practical expression of the work undertaken but by the death rattle of privatisation. That ideology of selling off cheaply began in 1969, but no lessons have been learnt. It is being applied blindly, without detail or understanding, to the AEA. That criticism will be repeated many times in our debates. If the Bill is to pass, it must be tighter, more defined and better understood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Those employees are anxious about the implications for safety that may arise if the Bill passes through both Houses, and they are concerned about the implications for jobs and that people may find that they have no employment on the site in the future.

Most disturbing of all, the Bill appears likely to throw on the scrap heap highly skilled and highly trained people. Our country cannot afford to lose the work that such people can perform, especially as many of them are at a time in their lives when it is difficult to find other employment.

The authority must be kept together so that it can work as a team, attracting interest from abroad with its essential, well-known and respected skills. Splitting it up into small units, whether or not it is privatised, will detract from the AEA's ability to use its skills, which benefit humankind as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By and large, the British public have a love-hate relationship with things nuclear. The nuclear industry has done much to try to quell people's fears, but they will be exacerbated when people realise what the Bill means for the nuclear industry's policemen—perhaps I should say policepersons—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Olner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the industry's police officers. We must keep that expertise together so that the team that has been developed can continue to work together. The AEA has existed for many years. I do not understand the need to privatise it for the paltry sum that the Government will receive, but the bigger crime would be to split the organisation into small units lacking the expertise that took so long to build up. The loss of that expertise would be detrimental to the country and would damage public confidence in the safety of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the atomic energy industries in eastern Europe and the former USSR, where the same stringency has not applied, present a real danger. Radiation knows no boundaries.

BZW's terms of reference were to examine how and when to privatise. Within that scope, it had no opportunity to ask whether the authority should be privatised and to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of selling it off—either in whole or in part.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is amazing that the annual report from AEA Technology—a Government body—is peppered with references to the need to keep that business together as an integrated concern. The report speaks of AEA Technology as a flagship and says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our uniquely wide skills base, built up from working at the leading edge of science and technology for over 40 years, is focused on providing integrated solutions in the closely related fields of plant and process performance, safety and environment."</p></blockquote>
I emphasise the word "integrated". It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The outlook for AEA technology is therefore bright and we are working enthusiastically to continue to develop a profitable, integrated business with a good track record and to exploit to the full the opportunities which are apparent both nationally and internationally."</p></blockquote>
It is that emphasis on seamless activity which concerns me—that emphasis on, to use the jargon, slipping across the barriers and boundaries of activities, using lateral thinking to generate that dynamism to which the hon. Member for City of Chester referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report states that AEA Technology
	<br><blockquote><p>"can solve many problems better and more effectively than those who depend on bringing together a number of smaller companies, each with a narrow field of expertise. Analysis of orders from our major customers shows that almost all of them draw on the skills of more than one operating division."</p></blockquote>
That is precisely the strength and the whole point of the business. Why, therefore, are the Government not even clear about whether they want to atomise it or keep it together as an integrated, dynamic, force?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Had there not been that flexibility, I doubt that the tank factory at Barnbow would now exist and many hundreds of the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could spend 20 minutes on the tank factory at Barnbow but I will not. The hon.

He uses it as though it is a positive term—yet, as he will agree, we spend more time in the House campaigning to ensure that contracts sometimes go to that business. It is one of the most unstable businesses and is never sure whether it will get a contract. That is hardly the most stable footing on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
which to set up an operation. "Flexible" in our society now means, "You might have a job at the end of the phone or the end of next week, if you're lucky. On the other hand, you might not." We could be more rational.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are driven by dogma. Some members of the Committee are experts on privatisation and have been pushing it for years, but they are out of tune with modern thinking—even modern economic thinking. Not so long ago, a winner of the Nobel prize for Economics, Douglass North, spoke in his prize lecture about what he called the "new institutional economics." He is not a man dealing with way-out economics, but someone well-rooted in the Anglo-American neo-classical tradition of Adam Smith and all the characters that we know so well these days. Professor North went on to say that the pure market model has become
	<br><blockquote><p>"too absorbed with the mathematical properties of ideal (and implausible) economic models"</p></blockquote>
and is being implemented to the destruction of the very institutions that it ought to support. In his report to the Cato Institute, Professor North dismissed privatization as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a simple-minded notion … a travesty of institutional reasoning."</p></blockquote>
I suggest to Conservative Members—although they might not have time—that before voting they look at that letter and at the work of that Nobel prizewinner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed privatisation is a classic example of dogma undermining a strong business institution. It is not good enough for Conservative Members simply to throw in the word "flexible"—"our flexible friend"—at every opportunity and suggest that it is their sole province. In this case, it is not. The integrated activities, experiences and skills that hold the project together, give it strength and make it a national and international competitor could be jeopardised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are prepared simply to sit back and think, "We'll leave it to the market because we've got these vague, out-of-date notions about privatisation", then they are being totally irresponsible with national assets. That is not just a crude stripping of assets—it is a refusal to stand up and ask questions about the impact of the decision. It is not enough to leave matters to a later date and see what happens. If we do that, it could be too late. If people start picking up different bits, they may choose the very segment that pulls the whole structure apart. The Government's approach is not conservative—it is destructive, and the Committee should not support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least our amendment does not throw out the whole Bill, it simply tells the Government that they ought to think again more clearly and put their proposals on the table, so that we can all be clearer about future possibilities. Conservative Members say that workers are interested only in their pension schemes. I refute that. A statement by a branch secretary of the Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists in 	<i>Nature</i> on 9 March 1995 fits the argument perfectly. Referring to privatisation, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do not agree that the market should determine the research because it is very difficult to plan any longer than a few years."</p></blockquote>

There are concerns within the company about how it is to be privatised and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will shed some light on that subject. This has been an excellent debate because it shows how little the Labour party understands about business. All privatisations since 1979, without exception, have been successful. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase) referred to my predecessor. For the sake of clarity I have to say that I am my predecessor's ghost reincarnated. He was entirely right, because if a public industry is losing money hand over fist—such as British Steel was at a rate of half a million pounds a week—it does not have a price and it is better to float it off into the private sector almost at any price and let the private sector sort it out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) intervened, because it brings me back to the Bill—I suspect that you were about to rule me out of order, Mr. Hill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend the Minister replies, no doubt he will say what form the privatisation will take; whether it is to be a flotation, a management buy-out or an institutions buy-out, because it could take several forms. Whatever form it takes, there is no guarantee that AEA will not be broken up when it is in the private sector. Even if it is broken up, that may be the right thing to do. Look at the demerger of ICI—it demerged into two parts, Zeneca and ICI—and the performance of the two share prices since it demerged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Purchase</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there is a profound difference between decentralising a large company internally so that the demand chain is shorter and that people are much more in charge of what they are doing, and the haphazard, cavalier selling-on by breaking up into little bits such a major company? Does not he understand the difference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not make a long speech, so I shall not allow any further interventions. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) referred to the possible separation of the nuclear and non-nuclear sides. The coal research establishment in my constituency is a similarly diverse company and is wholeheartedly looking forward to going into the private sector at some stage. Sound business and economic
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
reasons might exist for splitting it up, and the same reasons might justify splitting up AEA Technology. There could also be a good commercial reason for keeping AEA Technology together; what happens depends on the expertise of the management and on how well it is able to deal with such a diverse company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once AEA Technology is in the private sector, the private sector might decide to split it up. I do not understand, therefore, what Opposition Members are making a fuss about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend, I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill; it will be a great step forward for AEA Technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newbury rightly spoke about employees' concerns; he also indulged in some crystal-ball gazing and speculated that many jobs might be lost through the privatisation of AEA Technology. I should remind the hon. Gentleman that the employee head count of Amersham International in my constituency, which was privatised many years ago and was one of the first privatisations, has gone from 2,000 before privatisation to well over 3,000. That is a fine example of privatisation benefiting a company whose skills and expertise derived from the original public investment that was made in nuclear power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking about nuclear power companies, but spin-offs from the nuclear industry. As several hon. Members have said, the community can derive many environmental and health science benefits from the success of such companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be lead down the path the hon. Gentleman invites me to tread for the simple reason that I might be ruled out of order by you, Mr. Hill. We are discussing AEA Technology, not privatisation measures of 10 or 11 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
MORI conducted a poll of AEA Technology customers on behalf of the company. That found that its main strengths were technical and scientific expertise, and high-qualify staff. Its weaknesses, however, were its civil service mentality and the lack of commercial awareness. That says it all. We must make rapid progress with the Bill, so that we can liberate AEA Technology and put it into the private sector, where it can become as successful as Amersham International.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall start on a note of harmony. In discussions on the Bill, hon. Members have generally agreed about the importance of AEA Technology. There has not been a single dissenting voice. AEA has the ability and opportunity to make a significant contribution to environmental protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to enter onto the battleground set out by the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie). I must, however, take issue with some of his remarks and with those of the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase). I disagree with their description of the Government's intentions to "get rid of AEA Technology for "a paltry sum" or "cheaply". The Government's intention is to set AEA Technology free from the
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
restrictions referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham and to give it a chance to grow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not sound that note of disagreement in an argumentative way, but there is a difference in party philosophy toward privatisation. One side of the Committee holds one view while the other takes the opposite view—that is life, and that is politics. It is perfectly legitimate to take those views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept, however, that privatisation has been anything other than an enormous success. The Labour party has moved through that spectrum of political thought as fast as the speed of light. It if continues at its present speed, it will soon be on the right of me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Purchase</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs due to privatisation; I wonder how successful they think it was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to refer to that, which is a matter of concern—but the hon. Gentleman will also be aware that companies now in the private sector are efficient and produce their products—the various energy sources—much more cheaply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British companies are starting to grow and to develop. We can see the improvement in our exports, that unemployment is falling and that people are properly and gainfully employed. I must be careful, Mr. Hill, in case you drag me, rightly, back to the Bill—but I must point out that the above evidence shows how inefficient, overmanned and incompetent so many of the state-owned companies were. That is fact, and the reason that we made the changes we did. We must bear foreign competition in mind. I am sure that the Japanese do not operate to the same inefficient manning levels that we did. Now, however, we are catching up with them and exporting more to Japan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister claims that the Government's intentions are not to flog off or to get rid of AEA Technology but to set it free. Surely that is at the centre of the difficulties between us. Why can the Government not set it free in the public sector? The rules and thinking with regard to that have changed fundamentally and there is no reason AEA could not be set free without privatisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman runs a well-tried and well-worn route. Parties and Governments in the past discovered that to set companies free within the public sector still means that one is constrained by Treasury rules. [HON.

Will there somehow be a dramatic change whereby a Government-owned organisation can operate in the private sector free of any guarantee and free of the normal rules that govern Government activities? Of course not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another practical example of why a successful and expanding international company has to be outside the public sector is that it needs share capital so that if it wants to buy companies for shares overseas, it can become quoted on other stock markets and thus gain more international business.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Ellesmere Port and Neston and for Newbury mentioned the issue of safety. It is right to express concerns about that and it is right that there should be a formal response on the record. The automatic assumption that moving AEA Technology into the private sector would mean that safety standards would disappear is wrong and misleading. The Government have made it absolutely clear that safety is paramount and that it must not and will not be compromised. AEA Technology is committed to higher standards of health and safety and will follow safety procedures fully consistent with those that currently apply in the company as a whole. AEA has a superb safety record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we follow the logic of the hon. Member for Elmet (Mr. Batiste) that a fragment of the company responsible for safety is quoted on a stock exchange outside Britain, is it possible that the standards of another country will try to dictate safety? The truth is that Britain has the best standards in nuclear safety and it is imperative that the company is structured to maintain those standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right, but I am afraid that although his desire for global socialism to control and rule the world might be desirable from the Opposition's point of view, the Committee is in no position to dictate safety standards to other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason that AEA Technology will do so well when it is set free is that its safety standards are so high and so recognised worldwide that were it to compromise those as the hon. Gentleman suggests, its business would be damaged. I imagine AEA Technology majoring on the fact that it has such superb safety standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will correct a couple of misapprehensions that the Minister seems to be under. We are not for a moment trying to suggest that privatisation will automatically mean a drop in standards. We pay tribute to the safety standard that AEA has always adopted. We are, however discussing the break up of the company into different constitutent parts and anyone who has been involved in industry must know that the larger the number of sub-units in an organisation that one tries to operate, the more difficult it is to ensure that standardised procedures are followed properly. That is the only point that we are trying to make on safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is at least a potential in a fragmented break-up that standards could slip and the Government should recognise that and attempt to do something to circumvent it. We will return to that argument many times during debate on various clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out to the hon. Gentleman that he will be called then, so he can contain most of his remarks until then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy is coming across as the voice of reason and common sense, reining-in the wild accusations and words of his party. I can only welcome what he said and accept that he has put forward legitimate worries and concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might help were I to provide a little background to reassure the hon. Gentleman. AEA Technology will occupy premises carrying out both office and operational work at all the current AEA sites. Substantial parts of the sites at Dounreay, Harwell, Windscale and Winfrith will be licensed under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Many of AEA's operational activities will, therefore, be undertaken on licensed nuclear sites.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The licensed operator on those sites will be the UKAEA Government division. AEA Technology will not decide on the standards under which it will operate; it will operate under the existing standards and the licensed operator will be the Government division. The nuclear inspectorate regulates compliance with the terms of the licence throughout the licensed site, irrespective of who carries out the operation. So it does not matter whether there is one operator there, or half a dozen. All operators will be responsible to the inspectorate, and the licensed operator will always be responsible for ensuring that the licensing conditions are met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with several of the comments made by some of my hon. Friends during this opening flurry. My hon. Friend the Member for City of Chester (Mr. Brandreth) spoke about the importance of the staff and appeared to try to move the Committee on to a debate about the TUPE regulations and pensions. My hon. Friend is anxious to ensure that the staff get a recognisable and satisfactory package. He is right to say that a substantial number of employees on the site are looking forward to moving into the private sector and achieving even greater success. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) referred to the success achieved by Amersham International. We want that success to be emulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you said, Mr. Hill, we have galloped off into something of a Second Reading debate, so I shall return to the amendments. They would remove the Secretary of State's power to make more than one transfer scheme and to ensure that properties, rights and liabilities transferred under the Bill go to a successor company as defined in the Bill. I assume that the intention is to limit the Secretary of State's choice so that the only option available is to vest AEA Technology as a single, publicly owned company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's objective is somewhat different. As my right hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Industry made clear on Second Reading, the policy intention is to keep all the options open. It is far too early to make irrevocable decisions about the shape and form of a privatised AEA Technology. A few days ago, I had the privilege of being given a presentation by the board of AEA Technology. The company has been operating as a separate company for just under two years. The options are still wide open. Its business activities will require further focusing before the company can become fully competitive. If AEA Technology can meet its own ambitious targets, its sale as a single, independent entity may be achievable. If not, other options will have to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
I have made it clear that the Government will seek to maximise AEA's contribution to the economy when deciding on the form of the sale. I reject the contention that we are trying to flog it off cheap: we want to make sure that the best possible contribution to the economy is made, that the needs of the customers are met and that the taxpayer gets the best deal. A unitary sale may achieve that, but, as yet, we cannot be certain that that is the best way forward. The amendments would close off all options, and would oblige us to take a course of action that may not be in the best interests of staff, customer or taxpayer. I hope that the Committee rejects the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Mr. Hill, for your forbearance in this debate, when hon. Members have tended to stray off the amendments. One of the disadvantages of being a Department of Trade and Industry spokesperson, either for Government or Opposition, is that one rarely has to take a Bill through the House. One loses familiarity with normal procedure and it takes a little time to get back in the swing of things. In contrast, Conservative Back Benchers are lucky and are often able to sit around and to become expert at such matters. It was normal in the previous Parliament of which I was a Member to prolong debates on many Bills for as long as possible, but that is not the practice in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the willingness of Government Members to contribute to proceedings. We want a constructive debate, because the fact is that the Government have a majority in the House of Commons and if they wish to do something to AEA Technology they will be able to do it. We want the best possible scheme to be introduced. Such an objective is sometimes looked on as the secondary aim of a Committee, but that is often what is achieved. Even if the Government do not accept an amendment, it may focus their thinking and they may introduce amendments themselves—surprise, surprise—either in the other place or on Report. Reasoned suggestions from the Opposition—I hope that all our suggestions are reasoned—should be accepted by a sensible Government. We want this to be a good Bill and we want it to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall concentrate on some of the points that have been raised. Much has been made of setting the company free. I take issue with hon. Members who say that a company must be in the private sector in order to be set free. There are examples of companies that were able to trade perfectly adequately as plcs in the public sector. Provided that the ownership of the company is at a sufficient distance, it should not be precluded from having the commercial freedom to borrow money and to extend its activities either in this country or abroad. The British National Oil Corporation was a good example of that. What constraints can the hon. Member for Elmet say were placed on the activities of BNOC when it was in the public sector? Or on British Petroleum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The takeover in the United States.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That did not restrain its growth while it was in the public sector, and that is what counts. It was formed with a specific mission in mind, and it was fulfilling its mission statement perfectly adequately in the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the point made by the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury about whether breaking
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
up a company matters. He referred to ICI and Zeneca. For a company the size of ICI it is a perfectly sensible move to demerge into its constituent businesses. I have no objection to that, but we are dealing with a critical sector. Every analyst who examines the British manufacturing economy points to the lack of medium-sized companies within that sector, especially successful ones. Even under the Government, people may be good at creating small companies and getting start-ups going, but they are not so good at watching them grow, diversify and thrive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
AEA Technology is in a critical area. It has 4,000 employees and is at the larger end of the medium-sized sector. As such, it is quite a rarity in this country. It should be given the chance to develop and grow. If the Government's job is to facilitate growth in the economy, they must do so effectively and not be a neutral player who stands back and allows things to happen willy-nilly. The effective way to allow AEA Technology to grow and become a larger company with between 8,000 and 12,000 employees—good luck to it, I hope it can do so—would be to keep it as a single entity. At its present size it has a diversity of interests and the capacity to diversify further into associated areas that are critical to its performance in the relevant market sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman also agree that if a company becomes too disparate, management time and expertise become diluted and instead of being expert in every sector, it starts to lose expertise because management is not keeping its eye on the ball? There is sometimes a case for keeping the area of business narrow so that it is a world-beating company in the area in which it operates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is not as familiar as I am with the way in which a technological or research-based organisation works. I have had experience of research and marketing in the pharmaceutical industry and I have seen how a company can grow in complexity in a short time. Provided that complexity is managed adquately, there is no reason why it should not continue. Even a non-research company that is a horrible phrase but I cannot think of another way of putting it—such as Hanson is able to function even though it is a large conglomerate that is enormously diversified. We might take issue with the view that it is functioning in the national interest—it is certainly functioning in Lord Hanson's interest—but that large, complex organisation functions well. One has to manage complexity properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Gentleman accept that when a conglomerate such as Hanson takes over a diverse company, it quickly divests itself of those parts that do not form part of its core strategic business approach?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that enough has been said about asset-stripping in the past. We are well aware of the way
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
in which conglomerates such as Hanson operate, so I shall not stray any further from the amendment. I am grateful for your forbearance, Mr. Hill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is useful to show how much complexity an organisation can handle. There may come a time when it is necessary to fragment AEA Technology because it has become too big and too diverse, but it is not at that point yet. I have studied carefully its annual reports and it is clear that every step that it has taken has had a logical and close technological relationship to some other area in which it was working beforehand. We want to ensure that it retains the critical mass that it needs to continue to grow and to create wealth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is constructive and is not intended to destroy the aims of the Bill. It is intended to restrain the Government's freedom of action. I appreciate that the Minister may not be prepared to accept such an amendment. Although this is a paving measure and not a full privatisation proposal, as a matter of principle we want to divide on amendment No. 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 3 may strike Conservative Members as odd, but I make no apology for that.

	<ol>
	<li>a nuclear site licence (within the meaning of the Nuclear Installations Act 1965), or</li>
	<li>the fee simple estate in any land which, immediately before the day on which the scheme comes into force, consists of or is wholly or partly comprised in a site in respect of which such a licence held by the Authority is in force."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
I apologise for such a convoluted quote but that is the way in which the Bill is written. The plain English campaign
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
could fruitfully consider the language that we use in this place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is probing and is intended to tease out of the Government how they think something will work in practice. They must justify the logic and the reasoning behind the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government claim that licences will be held by AEA Government division. A document supplied by the Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The statement "The UKAEA will remain the site licensee after these divestments and therefore ultimately responsible for safety' is misleading."</p></blockquote>
I do not mean that the Government are trying to mislead the House—;that was the quotation. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"UKAEA Government Division have announced publicly at the 4th International Conference on Decommissioning of Nuclear Facilities (London, 14–15 February 1995) that they would like contractors bidding for decommissioning work to consider taking on site nuclear licences for some installations. Specifically they have invited bidders for decommissioning the Windscale Piles to construct their bids on the basis of taking over the nuclear site licence, if they wish. Whilst UKAEA might remain site licensee for the particular divestments mentioned above"—</p></blockquote>
I will not refer to that in more detail—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and for the immediate period following divestment there are strong indications that in the future UKAEA with DTI support would prefer not to remain nuclear site licensee for some contracts."</p></blockquote>
I do not expect the Minister to give an immediate answer, since I did not give him prior notice. I did not look at it myself until just before this sitting. However, I would be grateful if, at some stage, the Minister will clarify the matter of nuclear site licences. Will they stay in the hands of Government division or not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment Nos. 4 and 13 refer to two specific areas of concern. Amendment No. 4 refers to Warren Spring laboratory or its successor activities within AEA Technology. We propose to add the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"any property, rights, liabilities or assets that can be identified as having previously formed part of, or contributed to the work of the former Warren Spring Laboratory."</p></blockquote>
I accept that the amendment is too tightly worded for the Government to accept it. It might be difficult to get hold of any property, rights, liabilities or assets, but it is reasonable to suggest that the general set-up of Warren Spring within AEA be preserved in the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Warren Spring was established in the early 1950s, or possibly earlier, as a Government laboratory specialising in the environment. It has done an enormous amount of work on clean air, pollution, landfill sites and other vital matters. The Government have a duty to the country to continue to those activities themselves. I agree that it is theoretically possible to do that by contracting much of the work to outside agencies, but theories do not always work out in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned that almost 50 per cent. of the employees of Warren Spring from the previous organisation failed to transfer to AEA Technology when they were invited to move the Harwell site. We can assume, therefore, that at least some skills were lost when those people moved from the area. I do not suggest that every redundancy was a skill lost. Some redundancies were voluntary, others were not, but it is reasonable to assume that skills were lost. Warren Spring is no longer a single entity. It has been broken up into its constituent parts and subsumed into the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
AEA organisation, so the Government are in danger of losing that facility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a proper activity of Government correctly to monitor the environment. To ensure that that is done properly, the Government must maintain expertise in its organisation, and not solely contract out to private agents. What will happen if an activity is insufficiently profitable and no private agency is prepared to undertake it? The Government might want something done but to no avail, because the expertise is no longer available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will we set up a new Warren Spring in the future, built on a green-field site, to do what ought to have been done? It is nonsense for the Government to allow such a facility to break up and disappear and then to find themselves in the embarrassing position—it will probably be a Labour Government in that embarrassing position—of having to set the dash thing up again. That would be ludicrous. Warren Spring should remain in the public sector. The Government have a duty to perform certain functions themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Olner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is not only central Government who rely on Warren Spring to take an independent view and to give excellent guidance with no fancy aims behind it? It also gives honest opinions to many tiers of local government, which depend on its independence and expertise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That valid point illustrates the nub of our argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A company that carries out work in the private sector must make a profit. Not all work done in the national interest can be profitable. Government may find it necessary to undertake activities that no private company would wish to take on. We would lose control over certain central functions and I do not want that level of uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 13 concerns a sub-group of employees and would insert into clause 1 the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any employees of the Authority required for the safe management of any nuclear liability arising from the previous activities of the Authority."</p></blockquote>
Government division is to keep responsibility as a purchaser of decommissioning services and the Government, ideally, want it to remain just that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A purchasing authority, as we shall hear later in the debate, will not necessarily include on its board anyone with expertise in nuclear waste management, because that valuable requirement will be withdrawn by a later clause. We shall return to that issue—you might be fortunate enough to preside then, Mr. Hill, or, you may think, unfortunate enough—so I will not say more now. Retaining that function allows many other functions to go to other companies that may be bidding for part of the decommissioning process for nuclear reactors, but the many responsibilities for safety should remain the concern of Government rather than of a company. The IPMS listed some of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a few years since I worked in the sector. I was responsible, as a specialist in public health medicine, for nuclear safety in Fife, which has one or two nuclear installations around it such as the one at Rosyth—or it did, until Government policy dictated otherwise, but that is a matter for another debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The IPMS list of items to be considered includes;
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Managing the safe decommissioning of nuclear liabilities; Custody and maintenance of radiation dose records; Medical supervision of employees in subsidiary companies; Restriction of UKAEA Constabulary's powers over employees, or extension on the same footing to subsidiaries and contractors".</p></blockquote>
I am merely listing the items; I do not intend to debate them in detail because we will have the opportunity to do that in future. The list also includes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The definition of the nature and extent of work provided to or undertaken for MOD; Restrictions, if any, on commercial trading"—</p></blockquote>
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are so many areas of overlap. We are trying to carve out a convenient chunk of our nuclear work force into the entity AEA Technology and leave the management bit behind. We are not necessarily leaving behind the skills that are needed to manage the complex issues which arise. As someone who formerly worked in preventive medicine, I know that the medical supervision of employees and the keeping of radiation dose records are especially important. To be absolutely sure that there are no long-term effects, those records must be maintained for many years, long after employees have left the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain of the listed items are not properly defined in the Bill and if the Government do not provide assurances on them, we will have to table amendments and, possibly, a new schedule, specifically outlining those responsibilities which should remain in the Government division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not refer to AEA Technology alone; it is relevant to what is left behind, if only indirectly. If we examine the Bill carefully, there is little mention of the role of the Government division, following the divestment of AEA Technology into the private sector. I feel strongly that perhaps there has been an oversight. In the Government's eagerness to set conditions by which AEA Technology can be privatised under the timetable that they have obviously set—although they are not prepared to tell us that timetable—they have cut corners, assumed that everything will be done and are telling us not to worry about it. As Members of Parliament, that is not our job. Our job is to scrutinise legislation, and to ensure that nothing is left to chance and that, as far as possible, the work is carried out to the standards that we want applied. That is the reason for the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to discuss the issue any longer as I have adequately outlined the basic principle that we want to achieve. I shall leave it to my hon. Friends to amplify any other points and I await the Minister's reply with interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Purchase</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to refer to Warren Spring. Because of the excellent work done by the Library in that regard, hon. Members are aware of the background to what I shall term the débâcle that occurred in the Government's dealing with Warren Spring. It was intended to be absorbed into AEA Technology, but kept together as a unit, capable of continuing important environmental monitoring and the work involved as a consequence of that monitoring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that only half of the staff and functions were actually moved to AEA Technology and that they have been dispersed rather than being merged with a specific unit as was promised. As a result, it is hard to understand how the former Warren Spring unit will continue to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0433">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
operate. It will be privatised with AEA Technology and it will be exceedingly difficult to define where its functions will best be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If AEA Technology follows the normal pattern, it will structure itself to maximise income and minimise costs. My hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy suggested, however, that it will be difficult to make a profit on some of the work carried out by Warren Spring. There are simple reasons for that. It offers a support function for development—the development of new sites for building work and of other activities in the general community. If we wanted to reclaim land for open space value, in future, however, we might find that the additional cost of work that should ideally be carried out by part of Warren Spring would be too great to be considered in the general costs of such a development. As a result, the unit would be starved of work and would go out of existence. Work would have to be put out to sub-contractors. We do not know who they will be or even if a facility exists that could replicate the unit's work. We may well find ourselves in the hands of an overseas company. That is not a xenophobic statement. The Government have a duty to ensure the safe development of all land, and if they do not have the scientific and technological base on which to do that and have to rely instead on an overseas agency, they will have abdicated their responsibility. We should not proceed in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand from the excellent Library research paper that many of the staff at Warren Spring were made voluntarily or compulsorily redundant. I have always found it slightly amusing that we can talk about people being made voluntarily redundant. In the early 1980s, people were prepared to choose that option, but when they found it increasingly difficult to get another job, they realised their mistake. Packages are now offered to encourage people to leave their jobs, the inherent danger in doing so was summed up years ago by people in the Labour movement. Who used to say "You don't have the right to sell your job". They realised that that meant there would be one less job for the next generation. Jobs will be exported, and our competitors will grow stronger, not us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is foolish, and if we lose the Warren Spring facility, we shall lose the scientific and technological facilities necessary to our own development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to pursue the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy. There have been important spin-offs from the environmental research undertaken by Warren Spring, which have benefited the private sector. The relationship between the public and private sectors must be examined carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of work done on air quality by Warren Spring, startling technological innovations have been made by National Power. A few years ago, a number of hon. Members on both sides of the House expressed serious anxiety that the fuel orimulsion could not be burnt safely without hazard to human health. A lot of that work emerged from research undertaken by Warren Spring, which set achievable standards and targets. Interestingly, public and private relationship has resulted in some new burner technology that has made it possible to burn orimulsion more safely and efficiently than was envisaged originally. National Power has also been able to export
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
that technology. That is the synergy that the Bill puts at risk. The questions put to the Minister by my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy deserve detailed answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the management of nuclear liabilities, in an earlier debate my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) said that radiation risks must be handled with great care. I do not denigrate the skill of the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury in the important task of planting potatoes, nor do I decry the experience gained by the hon. Member for City of Chester in editing a magazine at Oxford, but my background is that I developed an X-ray analytical facility at what is now Portsmouth university. I have the clear and personal understanding of the need for long-term safety monitoring that is shared by everyone who has worked in an environment involving radiation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very worried by some of the implications and long-term consequences of AEA Technology's current liabilities. It is imperative that the Minister clarify how the Government will regulate the continued monitoring of those responsibilities. It is not good enough for the Government to pass them to the marketplace. They must be carefully spelt out, more than is done in the Bill, wherever radiation or radioactivity is involved. In other sectors, the Government have built up clear and established regulatory frameworks over time, but, while it may make sense from the Government's point of view to place responsibility for radiation liabilities with a private sector company, it is vital that people, plant and equipment—the whole environment—are protected by the previous liabilities. I urge the Minister to respond in detail to those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give the Committee some idea of his thinking about the possibility of leakage or movement from AEA Government division to AEA Technology? The Government prepared for the Bill by setting up the Government division and AEA Technology, but there is a real danger that, without absolute clarity as function, there could be a functional shift between those bodies that could jeopardise safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, in good faith and without a scintilla of doubt, the Minister's assurances that the Government intend to preserve the highest standards of safety and maintenance. That can be taken for granted, but the functional definitions could be changed if the Government division transfers groups of employees to AEA Technology. How can we ensure that AEA does not restructure itself and start transferring functions? That would make nonsense of what the Government have in mind for the package that they hope to place on the market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that on Second Reading I teased the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy on the change to the Labour party's traditional clause IV, so my delighted surprise can be imagined when I saw the amendment. I thought that I had achieved an instant conversion, but the hon. Gentleman spoiled that when he announced that it is a probing amendment and that he was not urging wholesale privatisation in this sector. I understand the arguments behind the amendment, and I shall deal with them in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the possible changes to safety. He will appreciate that I am most reluctant to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
comment on an article and on papers that I have not seen. I hope that he will allow me to take up his offer to allow me to read them. I shall give him as detailed an answer as I can then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is clear: it does not include a transfer scheme for nuclear site licences or freehold land subject to those licences. Amendment No. 3 would remove that constraint and would permit the use of the transfer scheme to transfer nuclear operations, nuclear liabilities and site licences to another body. Amendment No. 3 is a probing amendment, however, and I stress that those exclusions were included in the Bill to ensure that no such powers could pave the way for such a nuclear privatisation. I hope that Opposition Members will gain comfort from that. Nor do we believe that the privatisation of UKAEA in that form is a way forward for AEA Technology, whose future development could be hampered without the freedom and flexibility that privatisation will bring. The country and the taxpayer would lose the benefits of the unhindered development of the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 would prevent the inclusion in transfer schemes of any property, rights or liabilities of, or which contributed to, the former Warren Spring laboratory. I noted what was said by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East in that regard, and on Second Reading the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) made the point about the National Environment Technology Centre. I take this opportunity to give some background about the merger that took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
AEA Technology originally offered jobs to 150 people at Warren Spring. Just 85 ultimately took up employment with AEA Technology, with the result that that company had to deploy some of its own staff and recruit new people to sustain the business. AEA Technology's environmental business now employs about 450 people, compared with 405 at the time of the merger and about 300 in April 1993. There has clearly been a significant shift forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fears were expressed about loss of functions. AEA Technology is now involved in all the activities undertaken by Warren Spring except for ship safety, mineral processing and thermal processing. AEA Technology decided that those activities did not have viable business prospects and were not worth pursuing. The suggestion that the functions moved to AEA Technology have been lost in droves is therefore a fiction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Warren Spring and AEA Technology's existing environmental business were merged last year and now operate, as the Committee knows, under the flag of the National Environmental Technology Centre—the NETCen—at Harwell and Culham. I have visited the
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
operation and have seen how it works. The merger has created a comprehensive centre of excellence in environmental technology. It will help British business in minimising waste and pollution, in reducing costs and in providing the important technological base that British business needs to meet ever more demanding international standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The merger has provided an organisation with a broader capability than its constituent parts. On that point, I can turn some of the Opposition's arguments against themselves: one moment they say that it is dangerous to split companies up. I must point out that the bringing together of those two organisations has produced a better organisation, able to operate in wider markets than Warren Spring could even have done had it remained independent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, it would make no sense to undo the merger and would harm NETCen's prospects. It would harm AEA Technology as a whole and would deprive the United Kingdom of one of the world's leading environmental technology centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 13 does not distinguish between employees of AEA Technology and UKAEA Government Division. Several general issues were raised by hon. Members on the subject and I should like to deal with some of them. We all agree that it is vital that AEA's liabilities should be managed safely and be consistent with environmental and other regulatory requirements. It is also essential that they are managed with due regard to the costs involved. That is the role of Government division—to act as an expert management body focused on safe, responsible and cost-effective management of UKAEA's liabilities on behalf of the authority and the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have made it clear, and as the Bill makes it clear, ownership of the responsibilities of the overall management of UKAEA's nuclear liabilities will remain in the public sector. I am prepared to repeat that half a dozen times if necessary: ownership and responsibility for the overall management of UKAEA's nuclear liabilities will remain in the public sector. There is no disagreement between Government and Opposition on that question. We differ, perhaps, over the importance of achieving value for money on liabilities management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government and UKAEA are committed to increasing competition for the decommissioning and radioactive waste management operations work—DRAWMOPS. Putting work out to competitive tender reduces costs in itself but the process of contractorisation also opens the way to the transfer of risk to the private sector. It brings in specialist contract and project management skills, introduces new ideas and stimulates fresh thinking on how work should be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policy of introducing competition and focusing management attention on liabilities management is already forcing costs down. For example, savings of at least £50 million are expected in the three years to 1996–97. It follows from that that although AEA Technology is currently Government Division's principal contractor, it is only one of several possible contractors. Where contracts are let by competitive tender, AEA Technology is treated just like any other bidder. As more contracts are put out to competitive tender, AEA Technology will increasingly find itself in that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
Amendment No. 13 would deprive AEA Technology of the ability to compete effectively for future work by precluding the transfer of those employees currently working on projects for Government division. It would undermine its competitive position in the United Kingdom and, as sure as night follows day, its ability to compete in the international market for decommissioning and waste management services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the Government are happy for that leakage of employees from Government division to take place just as AEA Technology prepares for privatisation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As AEA Technology prepares for privatisation, much work must be done to refocus its activities, and that is dealt with in the Bill. That is why the Government do not at present reject any options for privatisation. Enormous opportunities exist in the market, and we all want AEA Technology and other British firms to exploit them to the full.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would place a major obstacle in AEA Technology's way. It would deprive the staff of the opportunities that a privatised AEA Technology could offer and would leave them stranded—to come back to the question of the hon. Member for Leeds, West—in Government division with only an uncertain future once their present projects come to an end. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will withdraw amendment No. 3 and I accept that the wording of amendment No. 4 leaves much to be desired. We might table a more acceptable amendment on Report. On amendment No. 13, I would have preferred greater assurances from the Minister on safety. Can he tell us at some stage how the points I raised will be dealt with and whether he might table an amendment later to define for which aspects of safety monitoring Government division will remain responsible? I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 12 in page 1, line 21, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) No direction to make such a scheme may be made until a period of one year has elapsed after the passing of this Act".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West had intended to speak to the amendment, but there was not enough time to table in his name. That was my fault, and it will be remedied by next week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments such as this are intended to frustrate the Government and to stop them in their tracks. Such dilatory amendment has never been accepted. The normal aim of such amendments is that the Act will be left on one side for the next 1,000 years to gather dust, in the hope that everyone concerned with it will be dead and forgotten.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is, however, not the purpose of this amendment, which concerns the nuclear review. I am sorry to disappoint the Minister by returning to the privatisation of nuclear facilities after having heartened—or disheartened—him with my thoughts on it in the previous group of amendments. We ask for a delay of one year from the date that the Bill is passed to the time that
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
schemes are enacted, so that the Government will take account of the forthcoming nuclear review. There have been many hints about its timing. I seem to have been waiting for it since at least the time of the most recent election, and it still has not come. The hints in the press are getting warmer—an unfortunate word, perhaps, in connection with the nuclear industry—that a resolution to the problems that the Government have encountered in the nuclear review is close. Perhaps by the middle of next month—or of the month after that—the nuclear review will be completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, I went into great detail about why any scheme for the disposal of AEA Technology should be left until we could take full account of the findings of the nuclear review. That review will cover all existing nuclear installations and functions which remain in the Government's hands. They include the Magnox reactors; the gas-cooled reactor at Sizewell; the Dounreay site's prototype fast breeder reactor, which is now closed; the Sellafield site with the Windscale reactors and its enormously diverse range of functions including the disposal and dissolving of Magnox elements; the THORP plant at which advanced gas-cooled reactor fuel is reprocessed; the mixed oxide plant producing plutonium-based fuel; all sorts of small research facilities, other sites apart from Sellafield run by British Nuclear Fuels plc; and the functions of NIREX. All those installations and functions will be covered by the nuclear review, yet the Committee is trying to make a decision about a company whose activities bear critically on the way in which nuclear technology will be handled in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than 50 per cent. of AEA Technology's current work involves nuclear research. It overlaps work carried out by other agencies and involves operations on their sites, but we do not know what will happen to those agencies because we do not know what will be sold off. It has been suggested that THORP might be privatised. It could be argued—although not by me—that more nuclear functions could be privatised than are currently being considered, and that other aspects of the Government's nuclear activity could be subsumed within AEA Technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a privatisation scheme should not be considered without account being taken of the findings of the nuclear review. It would be prudent for the Government to delay the implementation of any privatisation scheme, including that proposed in the Bill, until it is possible to make a rational disposal of all the elements contained in the nuclear review. That is what the amendment would secure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about a business that has an international as well as national impact. We are waiting for the review of the national strategy, but there are international implications. The Minister will know that the Americans are in deep trouble with contracts for the reprocessing of spent fuel rods, and that the United States State Department is already engaged in talks with UKAEA on plans for the work to be carried out at Dounreay. However, the science journal 	<i>Nature</i> reported that
	<br><blockquote><p>"if no such agreement is reached, the European Atomic Energy Agency … and representatives of several European research reactors are already negotiating directly with Dounreay about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
reprocessing spent fuel rods, fearing that the United States may not be able to fulfil a previous promise to take them back."</p></blockquote>
A lot is going on internationally, as well as nationally. The nuclear review would give us a national and international focus to sort out our strategy. Is the Minister aware of those international developments? Why cannot this privatisation be put in that context? AEA Technology would be able to give top quality advice and research back up in those dealings. Has that been taken into account?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many members of the Committee are aware that I have a significant constituency interest in the nuclear industry. The new processing plant at Capenhurst is located in the heart of my constituency. That may be a transient state because the boundary commissioners decided that it would be better placed in Chester, but I do not think that the hon. Member for City of Chester will have responsibility for it after the next general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is that in the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If you would accept it, Mr. Hill, I would willingly put it in an amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the Bill's terminology, I am less than certain about a number of significant issues relating to British Nuclear Fuels plc and Nuclear Electric. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West referred to the international dimension of the debate. BNFL has a new subsidiary called Urenco, which is a tripartite arrangement between BNFL and its Dutch and German sister companies. There is also BNFL Incorporated in the United States, whose work is valuable to the British economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the uncertain impact of the Bill on an unspoken nuclear review, there is a powerful national interest argument that we ought to hold fire until the government declare their hand formally on the outcome of that review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised a number of other points on Second Reading to which the Minister failed to respond: I do not think that he mentioned my short speech in his reply. We should consider the impact of the review and the bill on the work of the Berkeley technology centre, which is part of Nuclear Electric but undertakes work that deliberately overlaps some of AEA's work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, it would be helpful if, before the end of the Committee stage, the Government made the nuclear review available to hon. Members, or, alternatively, accepted the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy to ensure that nothing is done that would put us in an impossible position when the implications of the review are known.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I read the amendment, I assumed that the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy wanted to delay the sale, but when I saw yesterday's 	<i>The Times</i> with a headline about "Blair putting his team on alert for a snap election" I assumed that an integrated policy was emerging from the Labour party. I am not sure that it is able to carry through such a policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I assure the Minister that, had I wished to delay the sale until a Labour Government were elected, I would have erred on the safe side and would have made the period two years, rather than one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Right. But let us return to the amendment. As I explained earlier, the Government's aim in the bill is
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
to keep sale options open. One element of that strategy involves preserving the possibility of early or late vesting. Once the transfer scheme powers have been used to vest property, rights and liabilities of the authority in a transferee, then, in general, the property concerned cannot be re-vested by scheme. That argues for vesting AEA Technology in the form in which it is most likely to be sold. It is therefore possible that vesting by scheme would not take place for more than 12 months after the Bill has been enacted. Equally, it may be desirable to have a shorter time scale. We wish to keep our options open and our flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not blame Opposition Members for trying to cajole me into giving details of the date of the nuclear review. The hon. Member for Kirkcaldy's eyes are gleaming—but I have to say that I have no idea. Once again, I am sorry to be such a disappointment to him. However, the linkage that the hon. Gentleman attributes to AEA Technology and the nuclear review is not as close as he imagines; the main object is to increase the non-nuclear activities of AEA Technology and I see no reason why the company cannot develop in parallel with the conducting of the nuclear review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to clear up two points that two Opposition Members galloped away with. AEA Technology is not in the fuel reprocessing business. It was interesting to hear about the magnificent BNFL and its worldwide activities, but that is not particularly relevant. Hon. Members asked me about Nuclear Electric; as a shareholder of that company, the DTI is consulted about all the proposed disposals of any significant site. The Government are concerned to ensure that any de-vestment produces value for money—a phrase which has issued from us frequently during the 16 years that we have had the privilege of being in power. There is also the requirement for public accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the relevant activities are the concern and responsibility of Nuclear Electric. As the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy knows, it has held a series of discussions with several organisations about the possibility of out-sourcing its technology, particularly the Berkeley technical centre. We all know how many people work there, but that will be a decision for the company and, since it represents the experts, that is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be right for us to impose an arbitrary time limit on the Bill and I therefore urge the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Moonie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our objective is to see AEA Technology grow—frankly, I do not care whether its nuclear or its non-nuclear business grows. The Minister is raising something of a red herring. I want the company to diversify, but there are many plums around the world waiting to be picked by companies expert in nuclear technology, reprocessing, decommissioning and all the other activities in which AEA Technology is indirectly involved. It is not involved in the management of such places as THORP but it is carrying out technological research; some enormously interesting work is being done in fluidics and the study of how flows occur within that enormously complex plant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our argument is real—we are not just trying to frustrate the Government or to slow things down. There are many other ways in which we could have done that. I would certainly have ensured that the dilatory part of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0437">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
amendment referred to a time when we could be certain of having a Labour Government rather than making a reasonable supposition that the present Government will fall apart in the interim. I might add that that would have been put at just two years, before any Conservative Members stand up and say that it might be in 10 or 20 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>There is a definite overlap, and if the Government go through with the sale before they have a clear indication of how nuclear industry disposals will be dealt with, they
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
will be in a mess. I have, however, had my say—twice, in fact—and I do not propose to waste the Committee's time on a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>
