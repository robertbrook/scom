	<time>Thursday 16 March 1995</time>
	<p>[MR. NICHOLAS WINTERTON 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Finance Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Charles Goodson-Wickes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wimbledon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. Having endured 24 sittings of the Committee in my necessary Trappist state, I found it rather galling that during the Division at the end of our previous sitting my vote was not recorded on one of the few occasions when I could use my voice. I assure you, Mr. Winterton, that I was present and recorded my vote, which will be corroborated by my colleagues and perhaps by Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Dr. Goodson-Wickes) for giving me due notice of that point of order. I was not in the Chair at the end of our previous sitting, but the matter was drawn to my attention by my co-Chairman and the Clerk. Members of the Committee must answer very clearly when their names are called by the Clerk during a Division. The Clerk has advised me—I accept his word—that on the occasion in question, he did not hear the hon. Member for Wimbledon cast his vote. Any challenge to the result of a Division must be made straightaway and none was made in this case. There is, therefore, nothing that I, as Chairman, can do about the matter now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take the opportunity to tell the Committee that there should be no noise while Divisions are taking place. It is also worth noting—I add this from my own study of what occurred—that even if the hon. Member for Wimbledon had voted, the result of the Division would have been no different. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is prepared to leave the matter there and that the Committee will have learnt a lesson.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Goodson-Wickes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. Thank you for your judicious ruling. On a practical note, I was in no position to know whether my vote had been recorded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that all members of the Committee, the Clerk and myself in the Chair have noted what the hon. Gentleman has said. I hope that all members of the Committee will realise that the Chairman's job is not always easy. Likewise, the Clerk's position is not always easy, especially when there is noise and activity during a Division. The hon. Gentleman's point has been noted and will be registered in 	<i>Hansard.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I wonder whether I could direct your attention to column 751 of our proceedings on Tuesday afternoon. My right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary generously referred to me as one of those who
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>776</span>
had spoken in the debate on capital gains tax. I signed the new clause of my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill), but I was unable to take part in the debate due to pressing commitments in the Corridor. I realise that I have great influence over proceedings, even in my absence, but perhaps the record could be corrected for the bound edition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I can achieve what the hon. Gentelman asks of me. My co-Chairman and I cannot be responsible for what Ministers of the Crown say in Committee. I am rather grateful for that. The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Forman) has put the record straight because his point of order will be registered in 	<i>Hansard.</i> I hope that the hon. Gentleman is happy with my response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. At the last sitting, we heard the Minister's response to the debate on new clause 26. I was going to say that, having heard the Minister, I believed that my proposal was a more transparent arrangement and made advice available to all hon. Members, not just Ministers. I therefore did not accept the Financial Secretary's remarks and wanted to press my new clause to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) will gradually pick up the procedures of the House. Although a new clause—in this case, new clause 26—may be taken with a much earlier new clause, we do not actually vote on the new clause until we reach it in the order of new clauses set out on the amendment paper. The hon. Gentleman has made clear to me what he hopes will occur a little later in our debates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>APPLICATION OF GROUP RELIEF FOR BALANCING CHARGES IN
<br><br><!-- lb --> RESPECT OF SHIPS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>'. In Chapter II of Part II of the Capital Allowances Act 1990 (ships), after the sections inserted by section 85 above there shall be inserted the following section— "Group relief.</p>
	<p>33G.—(1) This section applies where any one or more members of a group of companies incurs expenditure which is expenditure on new shipping for the purposes of sections 33A to 33C (or would be so if the shipowner were the person incurring the expenditure) and—

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Waterson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move that the clause be read a Second time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss new clause 24—Shipowners deemed not to be connected with non-United Kingdom resident persons—

</ol></ol></p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise in what I think will be the Committee's last sitting to gauge the level of enthusiasm for new clauses at this stage of our deliberations. I shall try to be brief, but I should say that the two new clauses ar fairly technical and I shall have to deal with some of the technical aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two new clauses deal with group relief and foreign-connected parties. Again, I begin by declaring a sort of interest: as you know, Mr. Winterton, I have worked as a lawyer in the shipping industry for may years, albeit for few British shipping concerns—and the number is diminishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate what I said in a previous debate: that the shipping industry in this country warmly welcomed the announcement made be my right hon. and learned Friend
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>778</span>
the Chancellor last year that the relief would be available to the shipping industry. That should be recorded again. The announcement was especially welcomed by bodies such as the Chamber of Shipping and the Baltic Exchange. The Committee must ensure that full advantage is taken of the relief, and both my new clauses are designed to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 23 deals with group relief. It is a fact of life that shipping companies in this day and age typically comprise, or are members of, groups of companies. Different subsidiaries of a large company may be concerned with separate shipping operations. New so-called clean subsidiaries may be required by banks and other lending institutions to acquire new tonnage, or existing ship-owning companies may be bought in order to acquire the ships that they own. That is typical of ship owning worldwide. The concept of the one-ship company—owning only one asset, which is a single ship—is widespread throughout the international shipping industry. Although that system is deprecated by commentators, the fact is that it exists throughout the shipping world. There would be no purpose in discouraging it in this country alone when other countries would continue to operate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposal permits the company that has sold a vessel to use the roll-over relief for new investment in another vessel. That is unduly restrictive. Subject, of course, to safeguards to protect the taxpayer it would be appropriate to allow the relief to be used by other group companies. In any case, a relief that is restricted to investment in ships, and ships only cannot be used for other purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the issues that has arisen in correspondence between the Chamber of Shipping and the Treasury is that ship finance institutions require new investment to be places in a so-called clean owning company, often a new structure established for that purpose. I am grateful to the Chamber of Shipping for giving me a copy of a letter from Mr. Michael Borch, vice-president of Chemical Bank, which is a major player in the business. On roll-over relief, the letter refers to
	<br><q><p>"the obvious requirement that any new investment to roll over the investment into, is made by the disposing company."</p></q>
It goes on to say:
	<br><q><p>"We would like to point out as a provider of finance for such reinvestments, why this strict rule will severely restrict … to act in these matters."</p></q>
Mr. Borch writes of lending to a company not known to the bank since its incorporation and says:
	<br><q><p>"Such a company might have any number of liabilities, either contingent or crystallised, which are not apparent after even the most thorough review. Such liabilities might be tax, litigation foreign court award etc. Any one of which would have the potential to imperil the security of the new asset that we are being asked to finance. It is therefore our policy to insist that such assets are owned in newly incorporated companies, formed just for this purpose by lawyers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0945">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>779</span>
acting on our instructions."</p></q>
I can testify personally, having spent half a lifetime arresting vessels around the world, that vessels have a habit of picking up liabilities of all sorts during their career as they make their progress around the world. That is therefore an important factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also often bona fide trading reasons for new investment being placed in a different company. For example, some companies allocate different types of ship to different group trading companies, sometimes as a condition of external commercial agreements or contracts. Many aspects of a shipping company's business for example, charter obligations, ship management arrangements, flag registration and manning and labour agreements—impact on the way in which a shipowner's business is structured and operated. Those are matters that should be addressed by the treasury. For example, if P and O bulk decided that it wanted to slim down its commitment to the bulk carrier market sold one of its bulk carriers and, within the time allotted for the relief, decided to buy a new ferry, it would be absurd that as a result of the restriction the ferry would have to be owned and operated by P and O bulk, not by P and O ferries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A couple of other points have occurred to me relating to the reliefs. I understand that one of the Revenue's principal objections is that the original company might be put into liquidation or sold before the group informs the revenue that a replacement vessel is not to be bought, which could lead to difficulty in recovering the deferred balancing charge. However, the same objection could be used about any company using the roll-over relief or about a capital gain made in respect of a ship. If the gain is being held over into a replacement ship, it crystallises in the purchasing company 10 years after the ship was bought, thus a capital gain could crystallise 13 years after the old ship was sold, so there could be practical difficulties in any event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a parallel between roll-over relief and capital gains tax. Roll-over relief has been allowed for some years, and clause 42 of this very finance bill contains a provision that seems entirely analogous. As the budget press release from the revenue said, the change would
	<br><q><p>"give statutory backing to a long standing practice concerning the availability of roll-over relief for groups of companies."</p></q>
The government are resisting some of our amendments, calling in aid the need to avoid a mismatch with capital gains tax, but I have given a clear example of group relief already being recognised under the capital gains tax regime in a different clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may, I shall now deal with a new clause 24.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was remiss when introducing the debate not to have said that we were taking new clause 24 with new clause 23. I am happy to say that now for the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>780</span>
benefit and clarification of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 24 is concerned with foreign connected parties. I appreciate the natural concerns of the Treasury about anti-avoidance and the like. However it is a fact of life that much of the United Kingdom shipping industry forms part of international groups, some with ultimate ownership in the United Kingdom, some with ultimate ownership elsewhere. That would be a disincentive to boosting the fleet owned by United Kingdom tax resident companies. I fully accept that there should be robust anti-avoidance restraints, particularly through the tests of bona fide trading purpose and acceptable transfer pricing. However, effectively forcing an owner to invest in unconnected tonnage when his group has something more appropriate seems unproductive and uncommercial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a particular problem to which I can personally testify with new building contacts. It is commonplace for such contracts to be placed by single ship companies formed by an owner, a finance institution or the shipyard itself. The owner then acquires the new building by virtue of purchasing the owning company which would then become "connected". It may be retained as the owning company or it may then sell the ship to the appropriate group owning the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In another possible scenario involving new buildings as a consequence of the arrangements for financing the construction, there is often a requirement to maintain the ship under the builder's national flag and ownership for a set period. One member of the Chamber of Shipping has at present two large cruise ships built in the 1990s which are required to be owned and flagged in Italy for a period. Thereafter they would be very good candidates for fleet upgrading by the United Kingdom owning company, thereby increasing the contribution that they make to the United Kingdom company and, more generally, to the United Kingdom economy. The company would otherwise be forced to acquire non-connected tonnage to avoid losing any amount rolled over from earlier sales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, let me stress that my two new clauses are designed to increase the take-up of this very welcome relief by the United Kingdom shipping industry. If the argument boils down to cost could I press my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary on his estimate of that cost. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor last year confirmed that the whole cost of the relief was estimated to be up to £20 million. The Chamber of Shipping believes that it was more like £9 million and that is before taking into account increased revenues resulting from the relief. We are, in any view, talking about only a percentage of that global figure. Unlike the Opposition parties, we are not interested in mere gesture politics. We want the relief to be taken up and to make a real and lasting difference to the British merchant fleet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sir George Young)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) for explaining so well the case behind new clauses 23 and 24 and the reason why the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0946">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>781</span>
shipping industry attaches importance to the greater flexibility of roll-over relief. We discussed on an earlier occasion the Government's considerable assistance to the shipping industry, so I hope that we can take that as read. In the Bill we have introduced the present roll-over relief rules which are the subject of the two new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 23 would allow roll over of balancing charges on ships where a new ship is not bought by the company disposing of the old ship, but is instead, as my hon. Friend explained, acquired by one or more members of the same group of companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 24 would allow a ship bought from a non-resident connected person to qualify for the measure, provided that the person is a member of the same group. The intention of the roll-over measure is to encourage investment in shipping used for the purposes of trades operated from the UK. It is not the intention of the roll-over measure to provide groups of companies with a tax break by allowing them to cover a deferred balancing charge by a transfer of ships between connected companies—resident in the UK or not—or to allow the relief to pass between group members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have considered the new clauses seriously, there are two main reasons why I do not feel able to accept them. First, they would only really encourage new investment in fleets outside, rather than in the UK Secondly, they both open a door to tax avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend explained the international nature of the shipping industry and that groups of companies involved in shipping often have non-resident members. That is the key to our anxieties about the new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under new clause 23, ships owned by overseas companies and used for the purposes of their non-UK trades could be treated as new ships for roll-over relief purposes, allowing balancing charges in UK-owned vessels to be deferred. If the new clause were accepted, roll-over relief could be used effectively to subsidise investment in ships not necessarily flagged to the UK register, and certainly owned overseas; and with profits and any tax on those profits accruing overseas. That presents a serious objection to the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if we were to overlook that important point, there is every risk that changes in group structure could lead to balancing charges being avoided altogether rather than deferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the new clause includes alternative assessing provisions, I am advised that they do not go far enough. They apply only when the company in question leaves the group, or goes into liquidation. They do not cover instances when the company becomes non-resident, or when the tax is not paid because all available funds have been paid in dividends to non-resident shareholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 24 would allow the balancing charge to be offset against the purchase of ships from non-resident group members. The group would be able to plan a sequence of ownerships in different countries to get the maximum use of whatever tax breaks and other subsidies were available in those countries. That is "treaty
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>782</span>
shopping" which we do not encourage. No one benefits from it in the long run. It is not likely to encourage new investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shipping groups could only benefit from the relaxation if they had a non-resident member, or chose to set one up. To that extent, new clause 24 discriminates against groups all of whose members are in the UK tax net.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have explained concisely why the Government cannot recommend the new clauses to the Committee, notwithstanding the powerful case that my hon. Friend presented. The new clause involves three ingredients: a Government Back Bencher, the Inland Revenue and water. They made an explosive cocktail on Tuesday.

There is no doubt that personal equity plans have been one of the success stories of the Government. All Conservative Members are proud and appreciative of that success in encouraging personal savings, often on behalf of people who are not necessarily very wealthy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have twice put forward in Finance Bill Standing Committees new clauses or amendments on the PEP regime. Three years ago, I made a proposal that I repeated last year, to transform the PEP into what I term a PIP—a personal investment plan. The difference would be that a personal investment plan would be able to contain any instrument, quoted or unquoted, thereby removing current distortions in the savings market as a result of limitations on existing PEPs. Secondly, the PIP could be managed by the taxpayer personally, thereby ensuring that the full tax benefit being provided by the Treasury, or, more accurately, by the generality of taxpayers, would accrue to the saver and would not have to be split between the saver and plan manager or intermediary as it presently is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As will be imagined, I was extremely gratified to find that the Government had recently accepted a large part—the first part—of my proposals. They have extended the PEP regime to enable fixed interest instruments and hybrid instruments, such as convertibles, to be held in a PEP fund in future. That is very welcome and will achieve the purpose of providing a greater range of instruments for borrowers, which will be good for them. It is often much more suitable for small savers to have the lower risk but higher running yield instrument of a bond rather than the higher risk and lower running yield instrument of an equity. By the same token, that will increase the supply of those instruments, particularly to industrial borrowers, so I hope that it will help to promote an expansion of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>784</span>
corporate bond market in the UK. All that is very welcome and I am delighted by it and I thank the Government and congratulate them on that liberalising move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I try today to have a second bite at the cherry, I hope that I will not be regarded as churlish or ungrateful. However, the second issue that I have tried to press before, and on which the Government have not felt it possible to move, remains important and should be drawn to the Committee's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Put simply, a general principle of tax experience is demonstrated by the current PEP set up. If a tax incentive is available only via the intermediacy of some third party—in this case, a PEP manager—the tax benefit will, by definition, be shared in proportions that cannot, of course, be predicted exactly in advance, and which are often difficult to calculate accurately retrospectively. They will be shared between the actual saver and the intermediary or plan manager. That is the current case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been changes in the fees charged by PEP fund managers over the past two years. However, for a small income taxpayer, who is a small saver not likely to achieve capital gains of more than £5,000 or whatever the personal allowance is per annum, the benefit of investing through a PEP is marginal. He will pay an annual charge of 1 to 1.5 per cent. If we suppose, realistically, that the typical dividend yield on an equity portfolio is 4 per cent., a standard taxpayer would pay income tax at 25 per cent. and would therefore lose to the Revenue 1 per cent. of his 4 per cent. dividend. In a PEP regime, he pays 1 or 1.5 per cent. of the value of his portfolio to the plan manager.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, instead of paying 1 per cent. out of the 4 per cent. to the Revenue, he pays it to the plan manager. He may obtain some value from that manager if it is a discretionary, managed PEP and if the standard of fund management is high. Nevertheless, it is a marginal calculation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the new clause is to give savers the choice of investing through a plan manager in the form of a PEP fund—it may be based on unit trusts, investment trusts or a specific purchase of self-selected shares held within a fund—or running his own fund and thus not having to pay money to an intermediary or plan manager.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much publicity has been given recently to the lowering of the charges of PEPs. I hope that smaller investors are sceptical about that. It is true that the premium previously charged to people going into these funds has fallen from a standard 5 per cent. to a much lower figure and some managers have abolished the front-end charge altogether. However, we must look behind the headlines and see that, as entry charges have been reduced or abolished, exit charges have been introduced and that is a slightly sinister development. Management charges have not been substantially reduced below 1 to 1.5 per cent. per annum. Some enterprising brokers and fund managers, using good advertising to promote their work, offer a self-select fund without charges, except for commission, but that is very
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0948">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>785</span>
high—a good deal higher than is generally available from transaction-only brokers, who are known as discount brokers in the United States. Happily, there has been a considerable growth in their numbers in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fundamental principle to which I drew attention still apply and Treasury Ministers would not argue with its validity: if a tax incentive can be obtained only by passing through an intermediary, that intermediary will cream off a significant proportion of the benefit. Therefore, the generality of taxpayers are not paying an incentive to the group of taxpayers which we hope may be a numerical majority who are saving money through a PEP, but they are passing resources to be shared between the saver and plan managers. That is a good deal for plan managers and is an expanding industry in the City; I shall not increase the number of my friends there by tabling this new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to Mr. Malcolm Gammie, the tax partner of Linklaters and Paines who kindly drafted the new clause on my behalf. I asked him to do it and he was good enough to do so without charging me his normal fees, which would have taken me to the bankruptcy court. He is not responsible for the purposive or policy merit or otherwise of the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two subsidiary points. One of the great advantages of allowing savers to manage their own PEPs is that they would themselves gain the greater benefit fo tax advantage. They would therefore have a higher incentive to save and thus have a bigger impact on the aggregate savings ratio than at present, when a large amount of that benefit goes to the plan manager.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another benefit, which I hope will appeal to Treasury Ministers is that it will contribute to shareholder democracy as, by definition, when people manage their own plans they will be registered as shareholders in their own name. They will be entitled to attend, and to vote at, annual general meetings or extraordinary general meetings, where mergers, acquisitions, rights issues and so on are discussed. It is important that individual shareholders should exercise their democratic property rights in that way. They will automatically receive the annual report and accounts of the company in which they have invested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
PEP managers are under an obligation to give their investors the option of exercising those rights. However, they invariably charge quite a lot of money for that privilege. Most PEP investors are now being pushed into nominee accounts, and their names are not appearing on the shareholders' register. It is not possible or practicable for those shareholders to exercise their rights. Unfortunately, therefore, the PEP system, as it is currently constituted, is contributing to the trend towards the disenfranchisement of the small shareholder. I am sure that I do not need to elaborate to the Committee—certainly not to Conservative members of the Committee—the unfortunate consequences that that tendency would have if it were pursued for long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect that Ministers will say that one of the main problems with the proposal is that it will lead straight away
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>786</span>
to tax evasion, because individuals cannot manage their own PEPs without cheating. However, that concession has already been made. Elsewhere in the Bill there are provisions for the introduction of self-assessment. People will have plenty of opportunities to cheat if they wish to be dishonest in their self-assessments. However, there are sanctions. The Revenue has rightly increased its powers to audit the affairs of taxpayers, through the use of demand papers, documentation, evidence, and so on. The sanctions against cheating have been increased, so there are teeth to deal with the problem. It is not easier to cheat in the management of investment portfolios than in the management of a small business that is taxed under schedule D. If there are dishonest people around, they will be tempted to cheat. However, there is no inherent reason why the opportunities for tax evasion would increase if my new clause were adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might be told that a problem with the new clause is that the Revenue would have to increase its staff to cope with the administration of the multiplicity of taxpayers who manage their own PEPs: people will keep their own accounts and present them to the Revenue when they are asked to do so, which would require more revenue officials. If I got that response, it would be very useful. At least we should be frank about the obstacles that there are to go down that road. We could then make an assessment of the cost to the revenue on the one hand and the great gains to taxpayers and savers—and therefore to the savings ratio in this country—on the the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Darling (Edingburgh, Central)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) is on to a good point that can be made briefly: there is a suspicion that a growing number of managers regards PEPs as a gravy train on to which they have leapt with a vengeance. It is difficult to see how on earth some of the management fees that are charged can be justified. The time for the Government to do something about that is fast approaching. Weather by reference to the Office of Fair Trading or by using deregulatory regimes to force competition into the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for there to be more competition and transparency. I am not sure why the Government have been reluctant to pursue that line, although it is clear why the industry would be reluctant to throw more daylight on to there activities. It is in the public interest to have more competition, perhaps the proposal that was drafted by the excellent Mr. Gammie is the way to do that. If there are one or two technical problems, we should be pleased to hear from the Minister. It would be ironic if the Government were once again to take the side of vested interests, which are anti-competitive, rather than that of ordinary members of the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

argument that a further step down the path would bring greater flexibility, shareholders would be exposed more directly to the benefits of share ownership and, in certain cases, there could well be opportunities to save on costs. My hon. Friend said that he wanted to come back for a second bite at the cherry. I hope that he will not be disappointed if he does not meet the PIP this year [	<i>Laughter.</i>] I apologise for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Competition is now bearing down on charges. Some newspapers have recently referred to a price war in PEPs and Richard Branson's company Virgin has recently entered that competitive field with competitive charges. I saw recently in a Sunday newspaper that an investment trust—which, I believe, was based in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding—was advertising a flat fee of £25 per year, regardless of the amount invested. That is quite a competitive annual management charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many PEPs are invested in unit trusts and no extra charge is made for the PEP wrapper, so the whole benefit of the tax relief goes straight through to the investor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did my right hon. Friend notice the level of the commissions on dealing charged by the plan manager who is prepared to offer a fee of just £25 flat per annum for setting up a PEP? I suspect that those commissions might have been at a rather higher level than those available from other transaction-only brokers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be surprised if that were the case, but I shall make further inquiries and write to my hon. Friend about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to pick up a Sunday newspaper these days without finding a supplement on PEPs and an examination of such a supplement shows that there is downward pressure on charges simply because the market is more competitive. How nice it was to hear the Labour party calling for more competition to drive down costs instead asking for control and regulation as usual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have three or four short points to make which I hope will cause my hon. Friend to reflect. First, the current structure of the PEP regime means that the investor has no contact with the Inland Revenue—he does not have to declare the investment in his annual tax return and does not have to reclaim tax on the dividend—which makes it very user-friendly. Under the regime suggested by my hon. Friend, that benefit would disappear. While some people may welcome regular contact with the Inland Revenue, there are many others who prefer the streamlined process with minimum Inland Revenue contact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there are discounts for bulk purchases. If purchases are aggregated at the level of the PEP manager, a better deal can be obtained than would be possible for individual investors on their own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>788</span>
Thirdly, there is the problem of audits. At the moment, the Inland Revenue audits approximately 350 PEP managers and it is relatively easy for the Revenue to ensure that people are not exceeding their limits and that the investments are in the appropriate funds. Under my hon. Friend's proposals, the Inland Revenue would have to audit directly a large number of individuals, which would inevitably have an impact on costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the themes of our debates in Committee has been the simplification of the tax system. My hon. Friend's proposal would not simplify the tax system—PEP investors would find it more complex. For example, an investor might find himself having to claim monthly from the Inland Revenue the tax repayable on his dividends bought through the PEP. The Inland Revenue might not be able to carry out that rather bureaucratic process monthly for individuals, whereas it can be done monthly under the present regime, producing cash-flow advantages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's philosophical arguments are very strong, but I can foresee one or two practical obstacles in his way. I hope that he will accept that, for this year at any rate, we have probably made enough reforms to PEPs. Perhaps he might like to revisit this cherry on future occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intend to be brief. I hope that there is no opposition to the new clause, because we have the opportunity to assist people with disabilities. Section 265 or the Taxes Act 1988 allows a registered blind person to receive a tax allowance of £1,200 towards the costs of the extra burdens of disability. The principle is, therefore, established. The new clause would widen the scope of that allowance to include people with severe disabilities who receive a disability living allowance under section 1 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. I cannot understand why there would be opposition to that. The awareness of disability issues is paramount these days. The Government's increasing lack of credibility on disability issues could be addressed if they were to support the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden of costs on people with disabilities is increasing. I want to pay tribute to the work of the Disablement Income Group, which has been in correspondence with the Paymaster General. Its research in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>790</span>
1990, published in a document called "Short Changed by Disability", showed that the average weekly expenditure for the most severely disabled people whom it interviewed was almost £90 a week. The group's recent work on individual assessment on a case-by-case basis reveals that the extra weekly needs for more severely disabled people, excluding personal care costs, range from £105 to £148 a week—a significant increase. It is not that the ball game has changed, but that incapacity benefit has now been brought into the taxation system without adequate safeguards being provided for severely disabled people. Much disability-related expenditure is greater than the benefit that people receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In correspondence on 31 January, the Disablement Income Group asked the Paymaster General to widen the base of the allowance. In reply, the Paymaster General said:
	<br><q><p>"blindness is the only form of disability that qualifies for an extra tax allowance and to this extent it is anomalous. The blind person's allowance has always been regarded very much as a special case confined to a section of the community who command considerable public sympathy and who are readily identifiable. Even then it is only given to taxpayers who are officially registered as blind. In this context I do not regard it as a precedent for similar allowances for other disabled groups of society."</p></q>
I hope that the Minister has a change of heart because the definition that we discussed earlier gives certain severely disabled people the opportunity to benefit under the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cost has also been mentioned as a possible reason for not supporting the new clause. In a parliamentary answer on 9 March, reported at column 265 of 	<i>Hansard,</i> it was revealed that the cost to the Exchequer in 1994–95 of implementing the clause would be £20 million. I hope that the Committee will accept that that is a relatively small amount of money to pay to bring significant benefits to people with severe disabilities. Increasingly, the Government lack credibility on disability issues, but we have an opportunity today to do something positive for people with severe disabilities. I hope that the Committee will accept the new clause and make some impact on the lives of those people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Many of the sentiments that he expressed about disabled people and our responsibilities towards them will strike a chord with members of the Committee. However, I cannot agree that the Government have done little to help disabled people or, for reasons that I shall adduce, that the Committee should support the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Conservative Government came to office, expenditure on the long-term sick and disabled has increased in real terms by 260 per cent. to £19 billion, and about 2 million people now receive help with the cost of care or mobility compared with only 360,000 in 1979. I want to assure the hon. Gentleman that I have considered
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0951">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>791</span>
the new clause carefully, but I am not convinced that the tax system is the best or most effective way in which to target help for the disabled. The main difficulty in trying to help specific groups of people through the tax system is that it is of no assistance to individuals whose income is so low that they do not pay tax. Instead of having a variety of special reliefs for particular groups of people who may also be eligible for social security benefits, we prefer to have a broadly-based tax system with fewer reliefs and rates of tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister misses the point. The problem arises because incapacity benefit is being brought into the tax system. The Government have already decided to bring that benefit into the taxation system and, therefore, the question of tax relief is relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come on to explain to the hon. Lady that I do not think it is relevant in the context of the new clause tabled by her hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South. The new clause refers to a tax allowance rather than to a benefit that is subject to tax. I shall explain what I mean in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, there are about 1.5 million recipients of disability living allowance, of whom about 600,000 receive the care component at the higher or middle rate. However, of those, just over 200,000 pay income tax. That means that a relatively small proportion of disabled people would benefit from the new clause. I do not think that that was what the hon. Member for Bradford, South had in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our policy for a long time has been that the best way to help the disabled is through provision in the social security system. Several benefits are aimed at helping disabled people, including the disability living allowance, which recognises the extra expenses that the disabled have to meet; the disability working allowance, which supplements the income of disabled people who work; and benefits for people who are injured at work or while serving in the armed forces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of those benefits is taxable. The cost of implementing the proposals in the new clause would be in the region of £20 million per annum, a not inconsiderable sum, though admittedly fairly small compared to the overall cost of disability living allowance, which is £2.7 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the intervention by the hon. Member for Bristol, South Ms Primarolo, I should like to respond by explaining the differences in the types of such benefits. The allowance for blind people, which currently amounts to £1,200 a year, is an allowance against one's tax position if one has sufficient income to pay tax. At present in this country there are 140,000 blind people, and another 90,000 are partially sighted. Only about 30,000 of the 140,000 blind people pay tax. Some 110,000 of them pay no tax. Those people do not receive the benefit of the allowance. Similarly, if that £1,200 benefit were given to a limited proportion of those who receive disability living allowance—the hon. Member for Bradford, South has only
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>792</span>
cast it at the care component of the middle rate and above—only a small proportion, arguably an arbitrary proportion and probably, the least deserving proportion, would receive extra help from a tax allowance, but no increase in basic benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the problem is that, far too often, successive Governments have called different types of social security assistance by the wrong names. Often, benefits are called allowances and allowances are called benefits. For example, the disability living allowance is not an actual allowance but a benefit—an amount of money paid out to people—although it is not subject to tax. The allowance for the blind, however, is a tax allowance. I hope that, in due course Ministers with responsibility for particular allowances and benefits will change the name of those allowances and benefits to make it clear exactly what they are. I make that point to my hon. Friends because I have confidence that, in due course, all Conservative members of the Committee will become Ministers of the Crown. I cannot think of a better group of men and women to serve in the first Administration of my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Mr. Conway). I do not want to sound too sycophantic about the Whips or to suggest a challenge for the leadership. I merely recall that the current Prime Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) was once a Whip, as is my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury. Like cream, they tend to rise to the top.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should not like to exclude you, Mr. Winterton, from my observations on the political situation because you, like me, have never been a Whip, but, nevertheless, might rise to the top and the Committee confidently looks forward to the day when, in a future Parliament, under Mr. Speaker Winterton—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is all out of order. However, I must tell the Minister of State that, in this Committee, I am at the top.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nelson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not wish to provoke your modesty by referring to you as Mr. Speaker Winterton on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) made some fair points on new clause 28. Of course his sentiments are right in wanting to extend more help to disabled people. Our argument is that we have done so through the disability living allowance, expenditure on which has increased very considerably. The new clause
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0952">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>793</span>
would cost an additional £20 million a year and would be poorly targeted because an enormous number of disabled people would receive no benefit from it and most of those with the least means—those who do not fall into the tax net—would not benefit. I am unable to recommend the new clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sutcliffe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for this response. Our concern in drafting the clause was discrimination between various disabilities in clause 265 of the Taxes Act 1988. I agree that the new clause is not the best way of dealing with the burden of cost on people with disabilities, but that was out motivation in trying to change that clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not press the new clause to a Division, but I hope that the Government will ensure that the various Bills that are going through the House will have an impact on the increased costs faced by people with disabilities.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Timms 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rise with a feeling of optimism because, although I understand from hon. Members who have had experience of Finance Bill Committees that it is unusual for new clauses from Back-Bench Members to be accepted, a happy precedent was established on Tuesday when a new
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>794</span>
clause was accepted—it was not supported by the Government—which called only for a report. My new clause would do the same and I hope that as my hon. Friends were able to support the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) in adopting his new clause, the same will happen to my new clause, or perhaps the Government will accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The starting point for the new clause is Britain's poor record of industrial research and development in recent years. The contrast between the achievement in Britain and what has happened in our competitor nations is depressing. In 1973, we spent a smaller proportion of gross domestic product on research and development than the United States, but a larger proportion than our other main competitor nations—France, Germany and Japan. By 1990, we were spending a significantly smaller proportion of GDP than any of those countries. The figure was 5 per cent. in this country and the next lowest was Germany with 6.4 per cent. That is a worrying trend which threatens our future economic success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experience of the United States is interesting. In 1990, 7.2 per cent. of GDP was spent on research and development. In the early 1980s, it seemed that the United States was going into an industrial decline similar to that in Britain, having lost its technological edge to Japan. Unlike us, the Americans did not sit back and accept the inevitable. They set about changing it, and US manufacturing has enjoyed a remarkable revival since 1981. That was achieved with a Government of similar ideological complexion to our own. So what was different?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One major difference was that in 1981 President Reagan, with Democrat support, introduced a major tax credit for research and development. For many years, it was widely thought that that was wasteful, but an important study by Bronwyn Hall in 1993 changed that perception and showed that every $100 of tax credit given under that measure translated into at least as much spending on research and development. In turn, that generated increases in GDP that more than made up for the tax initially forgone through the credit. Therefore the United States has achieved a remarkable rejuvenation of its manufacturing industry through a technology-led strategy. The adaptation of the tax system contributed to that rejuvenation, although it was by no means the only factor. We must at least consider the possibility that changing the tax system in this country could contribute to our manufacturing rejuvenation as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not arrive at this new clause through the manufacturing route, but through consideration of the well-known information super-highway. All of us would accept the importance of Britain establishing a strong presence in the new technologies surrounding the information super-highway. We have a strong track record in the basic underlying ideas, but there is no sign that we are in a position to start exploiting those technologies as others are doing. Once again, there is a real danger of our losing out in the exploitation of new technologies, and that is a familiar and sad tale. No doubt the causes of that failure are complex, but I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will acknowledge that adjustments to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0953">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>795</span>
tax system could help in this area as in others. All I am asking the Committee to accept is that changes could help and that the matter is sufficiently pressing to merit the report to which my new clause refers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the new clause represents a political consensus. In responding to the debate that took place in the Chamber on 24 October on these issues, the Minister commented that every hon. Member on both sides of the House supported the need for a report along these lines. Last year, the Advisory Council on Science and Technology appointed by the Government presented a report that made a similar plea, but, sadly, the Government have yet to respond. Across the political spectrum and in industry there is now a consensus that this subject requires urgent review by the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to Graeme Cottam of Price Waterhouse and Co. for his advice on drafting this new clause. The strength of British companies in innovation is critical to our future economic well-being. In the new clause I have striven to avoid partisanship and all I propose is a report on this vital topic. I hope that the Minister and hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will accept my new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole Committee is grateful to the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Timms) for the considered way in which he proposed the new clause and made the case for investment in research and development. I do not think that there is any serious disagreement among members of the Committee on the importance of R and D and its relationship with the creation of wealth in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have to say at the outset that I believe that the new clause offers an opportunity for a brief debate rather than for an even briefer division. I hope that I can persuade the hon. Gentleman that increasing the length of an already long Finance Bill and asking for yet another report to be produced may not be the best way to proceed. There are other opportunities for ventilating this important subject, either on the Floor of the House—as happened yesterday, when there was a debate on broad band technology during a debate on the Estimates—or in other ways that are open to Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my response is brief, it is not because I do not think that the matter is important but because I think that the Committee is anxious to make progress. Of course the Government are aware of the critical importance of R and D. We share the country's pride in the excellence and strength of our science base. That strength has been and remains an immense national asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Government came to power in 1979 there has been consistent growth in real terms in the resources invested in the science and engineering base. The hon. Gentleman produced one set of statistics—let me produce another. Internationally, a 1990 survey of 10 major OECD countries, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States—indicated that in terms of the absolute level of R and D spending the United Kingdom
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>796</span>
was among the top five.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current system of tax relief for R and D expenditure in the UK is both comprehensive and substantial. The majority of expenditure by industry on R and D—some 90 per cent.—is of a current nature such as salaries and other running costs, and that qualifies for full and immediate relief. Capital expenditure on scientific research assets qualifies for 100 per cent. scientific research allowances—SRAs. That has been particularly helpful to industries such as the oil industry, the pharmaceutical industry and the automobile industry, where the relief helps to fund research into environmentally friendly vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other capital expenditure on R and D that does not qualify for SRAs is likely to be relieved under the machinery and plant allowances code, at the rate of 25 per cent. per annum on a reducing balance basis. So most expenditure on R and D can be written-off for tax purposes immediately or in a very short time. Our existing system of tax relief for R and D expenditure is substantial and is of great benefit to the economy. I do not consider that there is a case for further tax incentives, which could be largely deadweight and lead to the distortion of commercial investment decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in the light of today's debate and the strong feelings that all hon. Members have on the subject, we shall continue to keep the matter under review during the normal course of the policy decision-making process in the Treasury. Against the background of those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that he need not press the motion to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his response. While there is a comprehensive set of tax relief for such spending—as, indeed, there is everywhere—there is currently no tax credit arrangement which is increasingly common in our competitive nations. There is a danger for Britain if we do not study seriously that possibility in our own taxation system. Nevertheless, I am encouraged by the Financial Secretary's assurance that the matter will be kept under review. I hope that some measures along those lines might appear in the Finance Bill next year. On the basis of the Financial Secretary's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is designed to provide support to our high streets that are affected by major out-of-town retail developments. Many of those major developments will be well known to the Committee, for example, the Metrocentre in Gateshead and Meadowhall, near Sheffield. In addition, Merry Hill in Dudley in my constituency has more than 1.6 million sq ft of floor space and 2.5 miles of marble shopping malls and attracts 23.5 million visitors per year. It is a significant success story. It has been widely recognised that out-of-town centres have resulted in significant diversions of trade; the subject was debated in the Chamber last night and there was widespread agreement that something had to be done. As a result, the Government are revising their planning policy guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been little detailed research on the impact of shopping centres, with the one exception of the Merry Hill impact study. It found that Dudley town centre was the area most affected by that development, suffering a 70 per cent. reduction in pure comparison shopping—comparing goods that the consumer invests time and effort in choosing, for example, clothing and consumer durables. Several other areas in and near my constituency have also been significantly affected, albeit to a lesser degree. It is estimated that Meadowhall centre has resulted in a 30 per cent. loss of trade in Sheffield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1986, a catalogue of major retailers in service outlets have ceased their representation in Dudley town centre. I shall not list them all, but they include Marks and Spencer, Sainsbury, Rumbelows, BHS, Tesco, C and A, Next, Pizzaland, Littlewoods, Burton, Currys and Halfords. The flight of major national retailers to Merry Hill has had a devastating impact on Dudley town centre, resulting in a spiral of retail decline and an almost five-fold increase in vacant floor space to about 200,000 sq ft today. There has been a qualitative as well as a quantitive decline in retail provision; the former BHS and Sainsbury stores are now being used as indoor markets and there has been a proliferation of what are called pound shops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have now recognised the impact of out-of-town retail development on our high streets and policy has moved away from the laissez-faire attitude of the 1980s. PPG6 and PPG13 emphasise the need to protect the
	<br><q><p>"vitality and viability of town centres."</p></q>
It is now accepted policy that proposals for out-of-town developments should be refused if there is evidence to suggest that they might damage existing centres. Dudley is a clear case of where the damage has already been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>798</span>
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a memorandum submitted to the House of Commons for the report "Shopping Centres and their Future", Dudley council noted that
	<br><q><p>"The dramatic decline in retail activity evident over the last five years and its physical and environmental manifestation have adversely affected investment confidence in the town. There is little evidence of the centre readjusting or recreating itself … There can be no better example of a town centre in this country whose viability and vitality as a whole has been adversely affected by out-of-centre development."</p></q>
I cannot emphasise that too strongly and I want to do something about it. That is where the new clause comes in. We cannot turn back the clock, nor would I want to. Although it has created problems—and there have been major problems with access and road infrastructure—Merry Hill is undoubtedly a popular shopping centre. We can, however, right some of the wrong and repair some of the damage by providing assistance to enable Dudley, and other areas which can demonstrate that they have been affected by such developments, to move forward to a new, dynamic and exciting future. That is what the new clause is designed to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is small but powerful and would provide substantial benefit to designated zones at a relatively small financial cost. I have tried to be realistic in framing its scope and I should like to thank the Clerk for his help in drafting it. The aim is not to replicate the tax and planning regime in enterprise zones for affected high streets. It is much more modest—capital allowances would be for seven years, not 10 as for enterprise zones, and I am not proposing that there should be a business rate exemption, and certainly not a simplified planning regime, which was one of the root causes of the problems in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would also give the Secretary of State the power to designate zones, thereby containing its tax consequences. It strikes a fair balance between the need to do something positive to support our high streets and the needs of the Exchequer. It is a reasonable remedy, proportionate to the harm suffered. I do not believe that it goes over the top.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that they want to support the vitality and viability of our town centres, so I hope that they will support the new clause or something like it, designed to achieve a similar end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has vividly described the difficulties that can be caused by out-of-town developments. We are all aware of the tension between the added convenience that they can provide and the effect that can accrue to inner urban areas and high streets when some retail outlets move away from the towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will be honest enough to admit, however, that the new clause is deficient in several respects, even though he is genuinely concerned to do something about the underlying issue. It would give 100
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0955">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>799</span>
per cent. First year capital allowances for seven years to investments in buildings and structures within designated areas. One problem is that such action would happen after the event. Unlike the planning system which can look ahead and anticipate developments, the new clause would in many cases bring relief or propose action only after the damage has been done. Furthermore, the investment which it is designed to encourage could be even further delayed. The effect of section 1 of the 1990 Capital Allowances Act instanced in the new clause, would be that provided that a construction contract was signed within the seven-year designation period, actual construction could be put off indefinitely and still qualify for the 100 per cent. capital allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect that that is a deficiency that the hon. Gentleman would wish to correct if the new clause had any real prospect of becoming law. The clause is defective in that respect. The provisions made for enterprise zones insist that the construction is undertaken within the 10-year time scale for those zones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps a more profound problem is that there is no guarantee that the clause would lead to restoration. It would lead to some regeneration, but that could simply lead to corner shops being replaced by office blocks. For the first time office blocks which at present get no capital allowances would, under the new clause, be eligible for 100 per cent. capital allowances. There is the other practical difficulty of deciding exactly where the line should be drawn between areas that qualify and those that do not. In a city the size of London, it could be argued that some areas of the capital are affected by the equivalent of out-of-town developments, but trying to designate areas affected in that way could simply lead to commercial or industrial developments shifting between one part of the capital to another, regardless of planning requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson) said that it might not be expensive, but we do not know. Giving 100 per cent. capital allowances to buildings of all sorts could be extremely expensive. The final and decisive point which he raised himself is that there are planning regulations which already address this issue. They were debated yesterday in the House and the Government have announced that they are reviewing PPG6, which deals with out-of-town shopping centres and developments. The planning system is the right lever to pull here. The 1993 planning guidance note already sets tougher tests for out-of-town developments. The fact that that is being reviewed should in part meet the hon. Gentleman's concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must ask the hon. Gentleman not to press his new clause. He introduced it in a probing mode, but if he does press it I will have to ask the Committee not to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pearson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his helpful comments. I accept that new clause may be defective in some respects.

We have as a result seen a flight of offices to Merry

I would have loved to been in a position to declare an interest, but the closest I ever came was when a film option was taken out on my novel—but, sadly, was not taken up.

New clause 35 would make a relatively minor change in the tax treatment of film expenditure and would help the film industry with its cash flow problems. I see no reason why that should not receive support from hon. Members on both sides of the committee, given that the cost would be minimal and that the new clause relates to a finite time period—which would give an opportunity to see the affects of a more generous fiscal environment on an industry that is of significance within the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This issue has been raised several times in previous finance committee because of the feeling that the

government take absolutely no interest in the film industry. Lord Attenborough once called the former Prime Minister, Lady Thatcher, "darling", but even that was not enough to encourage a more generous attitude to the British film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is common sense to give assistance to the film industry. Action to support the industry need not have a negative effect on the Exchequer or on the national economy. Investment in British cinema films has declined dramatically since the mid-1980s. At 1983 prices, £425.7 million was invested in British film-making in 1984; sadly that has fallen to £218.2 million by 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Britain's ability to compete with film industries in, for example, the United States and the European Union has been severely eroded, yet film remains big business in the UK. The UK film industry's net overseas earnings are more than £131 million. In the mid-1980s, cinema admissions collapsed to just 54 million, but have since risen to more than 114 million by 1993. The beneficiaries of that boom for the industry both in cinema and video, are United States film makers and, increasingly, the Irish, to whom I shall later refer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Satellite television has also increased the market for film as more than 4,000 a year are shown on satellite. It is tragic that we are losing out on the potential because of the government's reactionary attitude to fiscal assistance and other support. All other Governments subsidise or support their film industries, meaning that the British industry does not have, to use a cliche, a level playing field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Lady is being critical of the Government's approach to the film industry, but it appears to me that she does not take account of the fact that her native land has been conspicuously successful in being chosen as the location for major international big-budget pictures including, during the past year, Braveheart and Rob Roy, which are both being filmed on location in Scotland.

Film-making has increased in Scotland, but potential has been lost. In a few moments, I shall refer to the situation in Ireland. Scotland has a similar economy and environment and we know that there could be dramatic economic benefits to areas such as the highlands and islands—not only in tourism but through the provision of services to the film industry—if we operated in a fiscal environment similar to Ireland's.

The British film industry does not ask for special

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warwickshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon.

All the production costs were shifted to Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Ireland has not only a fiscal environment that supports the film industry but an Arts Minister who occasionally watches a film and is enthusiastic about the film industry. That is sadly lacking in Britain, as was apparent when the Secretary of State for National Heritage appeared before the Select Committee recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause merely scratches the surface of the thorny subject of assistance to the film industry. I hope that the National Heritage Committee's review of the film industry in Ireland will present conclusions that will have some impact on the Government and that the fiscal environment for the industry will consequently improve. Such an improvement does not require a massive injection of Government funds. The film industry has not requested that. The international film community views the tax and incentive rules in this country as reactionary. That makes Britain unattractive to overseas producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tax relief for the film industry has been available in Ireland since 1987. The dramatic increase in film production in Ireland occurred after significant amendments to the legislation in 1993. A climate was created in which options were available for individuals or companies to write off a portion of tax liability in relation to a production up to specified limits. New clause 35 proposes a minor amendment to the Capital Allowances Act 1990 and will provide an opportunity for us to appreciate how beneficial the industry can be. In 1992, the year before the major reforms in Ireland, the spend on the Irish film industry was £2 million. In 1993, it had risen to £30.5 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The return to the Exchequer in Ireland in 1993 was £7.7 million and the cost in lost revenue was only £6.4 million. The Irish Exchequer, gained because of the climate that it had created to assist industry. One year of assistance guaranteed the equivalent of 400 full-time jobs. In November 1994, the British film commissioner wrote to the National Heritage Committee and contrasted the impact of regional selective assistance, citing the case of Samsung where each job would cost £25,000. Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte undertook research that showed that for a cost of £2,000 we could create one more job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that new clause 35 will right the wrongs that the British industry has suffered, especially in the past 16 years. However, it provides an opportunity for the Government to show commitment to a major industry and for us to generate economic growth in a sector that covers

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to add a few comments to the excellent presentation of my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell), who is personally interested in the industry as well as supporting the principle of our modest proposal to assist the British film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Commission's think tank considered audio visual policy last year. It predicted that the European market for films, television films and audio visual products would grow by 300 per cent. in the next 20 years. The enormous European market, let alone the world market, has particular advantages for the British film industry if it can take advantage of those opportunities. It is important that we make a strong case for its argument. The industry does not ask for handouts or subsidies but for a tax regime that will assist it to pay more to the Exchequer because of its growth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British film industry is already the largest player, with 25 per cent. of the European market. It has an unparalleled talent base, as I know well from Bristol, the home of the animators Wallace an Gromit and their wonderful successes. About one third of the Oscars in the past 20 years have been won by British talent. In animation, British successes are even more astonishing: three of the four Oscars awarded for animation have been won by British film makers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the greatest opportunity to contribute to the growth of the British film industry as 70 per cent. of the world's films are made in English, which is rapidly becoming the international language. That may not be such a good thing in some respects as the need for us to speak another language, and therefore our ability to do so, diminishes as we can continue to communicate in English. However, it shows the potential for the British industry, which already employs more people than the car industry. Unlike the car industry, however, the forecast is that the film industry will grow and, because it is based on talent, it is labour intensive. It offers unparalleled opportunities of which we should take advantage. The Government should be encouraged to give incentives to support the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The British film industry should be concerned with moral values, and reflect our experiences, our culture and the country's social cohesion. It should be based not just on making the largest profit, but on quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Financial Secretary will say what the Government will do to support this vital industry, which is important to the Exchequer and for cultural development. There is a vast, untapped talent that can contribute to this vibrant, industry in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A healthy film industry would benefit Britain's cultural life and bring revenue to the Treasury. The new clause would offer tax relief to British film makers and encourage investment. As my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, East (Mrs. Liddell) said, investment in United Kingdom films has been disastrous in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>804</span>
the past decade. It fell from £425.7 million in 1984 to £218.2 million in 1993 in real terms, based on 1993 prices and we must reverse that decline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British films have a long and successful heritage that we must protect. Some of the finest actors are British: Daniel Day Lewis, Hugh Grant, Jeremy Irons, Helen Mirren, Dudley Moore, Bob Hoskins, Juliet Stevenson, for example. Great British directors include Stephen Frears who directed "Dangerous Liaisons", Richard Attenborough, director of "Ghandi", Mike Newell of "Four Weddings and a Funeral", and producers such as David Puttnam—"Local Hero" and "The Mission"—Jeremy Thomas—"The Last Emperor"—and Steve Abbott—"A Fish Called Wanda". British designers and cameramen have great talents: "Star Wars" was made at Elstree and the James Bond films were made at Pinewood. "The Guns of Navarone" were fired at Shepperton and "Alien" was discovered there. We have a great tradition, but it is in danger because it is not supported by the Government. The tax reliefs proposed in the new clause are likely to have a considerable impact—far greater than they might have on any other industry. The film industry responds very quickly to events. It is more mobile and a shift in Government policy can cause film makers to flock to or flock away from a particular country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already heard a Conservative Member mention the film "Braveheart". Mel Gibson started filming in Scotland—the film, after all, is about William Wallace, a great Scottish hero in the fight against the English—but after six weeks he was persuaded by the Irish Minister responsible for film to film the rest in Ireland. That was a great loss to the film industry and culture in Britain and also to the Exchequer. Taxes are being paid over there instead of over here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1992, according to the British Film Commission, one film was being made in Ireland, with a budget of 1 million Irish pounds. Last year, there were 18 films, with a total income to Ireland of approximately £100 million. That is a direct example of how a change in Government policy could directly benefit this country. The true problem is that, whereas the Irish Government support their film industry, the Tories do not support ours. The Government offer no real incentives to attract film makers to Britain. Before the National Heritage Committee last month, the Secretary of State for National Heritage admitted that he could not even remember the last film that he saw. By contrast, his Irish opposite number, Michael Higgins, has not only given tax breaks, but told producers that they could phone him at any time if they had any problems. The result is that the Irish film industry is benefiting, often at the cost of the British film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The City has also said that unless we have the sort of level playing field that is available in other countries with various tax incentives and benefits to film makers, the British film industry will not be safeguarded and its future will not be protected. We need the Government to act urgently, and they can do so by supporting the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Committee. The lights are about to go out, the audience is about to leave and the actors are about to quit. I have been assured by people in the film industry that, if the Financial Secretary accepts the new clause, next year there will be a British-made film called "The Finance Committee" starring Sir George Young, Mr. Heathcoat-Amory, Anthony Nelson and Jonathan Aitken, with supporting roles for everybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While listening to the debate, the Financial Secretary has been fed his script by the script writers on the top Table. I urge him to throw that script away and speak from the heart. He should adopt the method acting of leadership, because the British film industry is just like one of those humble young virgins strapped to the railway line with a thundering locomotive approaching. There is the chance today for a hero to ride in and save the British film industry from its gradual extinction. I ask the Financial Secretary to play that great part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation in Ireland has been mentioned. In France there are similar tax reliefs and as a result three times more French-made films are produced than British-made films.

The new clause raises an important issue—the British film industry. As the Member of Parliament representing Ealing, I am no stranger to the fortunes of the United Kingdom film industry. In my view, some of the greatest films ever made were made in Ealing: the classics produced by the Ealing film studios—"Kind Hearts and Coronets", "The Lavendar Hill Mob", "The Ladykillers" and many others. I approach the subject with a keen interest in the fortunes of our film industry. Contrary to the impression given by Opposition Members, the Government have not neglected the industry. On the contrary, as I will prove in a moment, we have given it more favourable tax treatment than any other business in the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members touched on some of the films recently shot in this country. You, Mr. Winterton, may have seen some of them, including "Four Weddings and Funeral" and "Shadowlands". Some of them you may have missed, such as "Interview with the Vampire" and "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein". There are many others that the hon. Member for Congleton (Mrs. Winterton) would rather you did not see. Major films are likely to be made in the UK in 1995. One will be of particular interest to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>806</span>
Opposition Members—"Mission Impossible". The Liberal Democrats serving on the Committee will be particularly interested in one called "Incognito" and, indeed, another called "Artificial Intelligence".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Investment in films made in the UK has risen from £185 million in 1992 to £457 million in 1994—it doubled between 1993 and 1994. That was not reflected in the flavour of speeches made by Opposition Members. The Government have for some time recognised that there are problems in the film industry. We have, therefore, given it a generous regime which, as I have said, is more favourable than that in any other industry. No profits need to be recognised for tax purposes until all expenditure—capital and revenue—has been absorbed. If it becomes clear that the film will not make a profit, the loss can be written off immediately against other profits. Since 1992, even more generous allowances have been given to films with a substantial UK or European Union input.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Monklands, East has one or two things wrong with it. For some reason, it applies only to spending in the year to 31 March 1996. It is not clear why, if the new regime is so good, it runs out after 12 months. Also, its drafting means that the expenditure on the qualifying film could be written off more than once. It is sensible to recognise that substantial changes were made in 1992. Those have not had time to bed in, and this is not the time to embark on a fresh range of extra tax reliefs for the film industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with one or two specific points. The film "Braveheart", staring Mr. Mel Gibson, was much quoted. The evidence suggests that the Irish tax regime alone did not cause the move. Mr. Gibson was personally lobbied by the Irish Minister for arts to move production to Ireland. He was offered the services of the Irish army as film extras, free of cost. Although the Irish tax regime may have been a factor, it is not possible to say that it was the only one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently discussed the future of the film industry with the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television in a helpful and constructive meeting. Hon. Members might have seen the interview with the star of "Judge Dredd", Mr. Sylvester Stallone, on "Film 95" on Monday. He said that he regarded our special effects creators—who were mentioned by the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo)—and set makers as unrivalled throughout the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recent proposal to establish a new £40 million film studio at Leavesden aerodrome near Watford will give a further boost to our infrastructure facilities. I believe that the outlook for the UK film industry is optimistic and has been greatly assisted by the tax regime introduced by the Government. Now is not the time to adopt a new clause—somewhat insensitively drafted—that extends tax reliefs even further given the favourable regime that already exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

primarily due to the devaluation of the pound since 1992, and most of those new films are Hollywood productions. The average budget for mainly British films has fallen during the past year from £2.2 million to £1.3 million.

I thank the Minister for the fact that his remarks displayed an "Absence of Malice". In view of the Committee's desire to move on, I am prepared to withdraw the new clause in the hope that, when the National Heritage Select Committee report is published, the Government may take a more sympathetic attitude to an industry that is doing well, but which could do an awful lot better.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of structured settlements does not have the glamour and popular appeal of the film industry. None the less, it is important. The purpose of the new clause is to facilitate the payment in personal injury cases of settlements through annuities, rather than lump sums, by changing the present taxation system, which discriminates between the two. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Mr. Hoyle) and to Ivor Levy of Frenkel Topping for drawing my attention to the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Structured settlements paid under annuities have the advantage of providing future income that is staged and geared to the recipient's needs. The arrangements can make specific future financial provision for care, housing, marriage and child care, for example, rather than those contingencies being crudely translated into a lump sum in advance. Structured settlements also have the merit of certainty so that the injured person knows what income he will receive for the rest of his life. The recipient is protected for the dissipation of the lump sum and relieved of the burden of managing it, which is an obvious benefit to the severely injured and to children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the tax treatment of structured settlements under current law is that it imposes an additional administrative burden, which encourages insurers to avoid participating in structuring. The system is unnecessarily complex and convoluted. Under the existing tax administration rules, the injured person who is entitled to receive lump sum payments free of tax is unable to receive those payments directly from an annuity without tax being deducted. Instead, payments must go through the defendant's insurer, who is responsible for grossing up the payment to take account of tax before passing it to the injured person and then reclaiming the grossed up tax from the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would remove that extra and unnecessary tax administration and, indeed, cut the cost both to the defendant's insurers and to the tax authorities. It would exempt from the deduction of income tax any payments made under an annuity purchased as part of a structured settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That cost nothing and merely saves the tax being paid and then repaid. People who have suffered serious injuries would benefit as it would bring about fair treatment between structured settlements and lump-sum payments. I commend the new clause to the Committee and hope that we shall hear a favourable response from the Government on the principle of this proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Protection Act 1975 to the victim of the injury. We are sympathetic to those objectives and I only propose that the new clause should not go forward so that we can introduce a wider measure on Report. We hope that the wider definition might extend exemption to damages claimed under the laws of some overseas territories where the concept of the structured settlement also exists. We should also like to examine the possibility that the exemption could apply not only to annuities to be purchased under future agreements but to an existing annuity were the insurance company and the individual receiving damages to renegotiate their agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the new clause, as drafted, provides authority for the annuity to be paid without deduction of tax, it does not deal with the procedural aspects. The payer of the annuity needs certainty that the annuity in question is within the exemption, before venturing to pay it gross. I hope that members of the Committee will agree that the proposal's objectives are better achieved by deferring action to the Report stage, when a more comprehensive measure can be introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the cross-party consensus that emerged in our consideration of the previous new clause will continue with this measure, which aims to provide a level playing field between charitable donations given by companies in Britain and those given by British companies in countries where exchange controls restrict free transfer of funds out of those countries. Those funds are known as blocked funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, charitable donations, whether they are made under a deed of covenant or as one-off payments under the gift aid rules, do not qualify for tax relief unless the donor deducts income tax from the gift, which is assessed at basic rate. The donor pays the tax to the Inland Revenue, and the charity reclaims the tax from the Revenue. That rule does not raise money for the Exchequer but serves as a control system for the revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of the blocked funds, however, the impact of the rule provides a disincentive for companies with funds abroad to contribute to charities. Such a company is required to deduct tax from the gift and pay it to the revenue, but, because the company cannot get its funds out of the country, it has to find additional funds from within Britain to pass the tax to the revenue from where it is reclaimed later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a United Kingdom investor wants to give blocked funds to a UK charity operating in the country concerned, it has to obtain consent from the local government or central government to transfer the funds to the charity's accounts in that country. Generally, where that has been attempted, the company has not been allowed to repatriate the funds to enable the donor to comply with UK tax rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impact of the system is that a company that wishes to make a donation from funds that are locked into a country abroad has to find additional monies in sterling to make the contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the committee is anxious to make haste, but I should like very briefly to go through some calculations. If a company in Britain wanted to make a donation of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0961">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>811</span>
£75,000, it would have to pay £18,750 in income tax. The company would receive 33 per cent. tax relief on the donation, which, on £75,000, is nearly £25,000. The cost of the company is therefore just over £50,000, although the charity would benefit by £75,000. If a foreign company wanted to give £75,000, it would have to find £25,000 in the United Kingdom to pay to the revenue. The company would therefore put in £100,000; it would get £33,000 on the 33 per cent. rule, so the donor's cost would be £67,000, compared with £50,000, which the British donor company would pay. The greater cost to the foreign donor is another disincentive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Donors and charities try to get around the rules, and sometimes they secure successful donations of block funds. They can negotiate with the Government for special consent to commit the temporary relief on sufficient foreign currency to settle the UK tax liability on the condition that the charity provides a guarantee to replace the funds once it has reclaimed the tax from the Revenue. However, that solution has several disadvantages: it depends upon the co-operation of a foreign Government, and few countries are willing to cooperate; it requires protracted negotiations over many months, and, quite often, by the time that one is successful in obtaining consent, the company's circumstances may have changed; and the charity may not be able to give the guarantee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the new clause make any difference? We shall not know until we have tried. However, the evidence in America is that, seven years after the introduction of a similar scheme, an extra $100 million was raised in charitable contributions. That is especially important in Britain, where charitable donations are in decline because of the national lottery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement for tax to be deducted from a company donation to a charity should be removed when donations are made from block funds. The proposal would cost the Exchequer nothing—the charities would lose money because they could not reclaim the tax, but at least they would get something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious to ensure that the Revenue's concerns about the policing of donations should be sustained. For that reason, we have suggested in the new clause that a duty should be imposed on charities through a certification procedure for gifts of block funds. That would give the Revenue the details that it needs to administer the system. The new clause has been drafted with a view to implementing twin proposals: removing the requirements to deduct tax and introducing the certification procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Revenue fears abuse because companies could set up charities to launder money. I do not believe that there is any evidence of such abuse. The certification procedure would ensure that such abuse will not occur. The proposal would cost the Exchequer nothing, but it could bring great benefit to charities by releasing donations from block funds at a time when there is a desire among the Government and the Opposition to increase the role of charities in many realms of public life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to help the hon. Lady, who moved her new clause beautifully and well within the allotted time. I am also conscious of the need to do that. However, I cannot extend the generosity exemplified by my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary. The new clause would undermine an important tax principle that has been in place since 1986 and was introduced because of substantial abuse, which was overcome only by the present insistence that tax relief should be routed through the Inland Revenue. That is now a central feature of the gift aid scheme and covenants to charity. I cannot countenance any erosion of that important control system which has been very successful in encouraging charitable giving while protecting the essential charitable purpose of the giving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady wondered whether her clause would lead to additional charitable donations in the countries concerned. I have doubts about that, because companies with blocked funds in some of those countries often find other commercial uses for the funds. That is probably the reason why countries block the remittance of funds—to encourage reinvestment of funds held by companies that may be winding up a project. That may be why no pressure for amendment of the law has come from overseas companies. Either they find alternative commercial outlets for funds or they find other ways of giving residue funds to charity—the hon. Lady was honest enough to concede that alternative administrative arrangements can achieve the charitable purpose. Perhaps the most obvious way is for blocked funds to be given to charity and for the tax to be remitted not from blocked funds but from United Kingdom parent company funds to the Inland Revenue in this country, thereby achieving the donation under the present tax arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with the aim of the new clause, but I am unwilling to ask the Committee to erode an important measure against tax avoidance and abuse. I am also unwilling to launch an amendment when the cost could be substantial and I am not certain that it would encourage charitable giving in the way intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was to prevent the abuse that the certification procedure is suggested in the new clause. The purpose of the new clause is not to create an incentive, but to remove an anomaly that makes such donations more expensive if they are made abroad than if they are made in sterling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Charities Tax Reform Group surveyed 100 United Kingdom multinational companies to establish whether current rules hinder charitable donations. Of the 55 companies that replied, 24 stated that they had no blocked funds and 23—almost a quarter—identified the current tax rules as a disincentive.

	<div class='title'>TRANSITIONAL RELIFE FOR CHARITIES (ESTATE OF DECEASED PERSON)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>'The provisions of section 80 (Transitional Relief for Charities etc.) of the Finance Act 1993 shall apply to the estates of deceased persons in the course of administration.'.—[	<i>Mr. Butterfill.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many charities receive income that derives from the estate of a deceased person. The money has been left to the charity and it is deemed to be income in their hands, even though technically it goes to the administrator of the estate pending the grant of probate. That procedure is well established; in fact, it was enacted by this Government under section 696 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. That Act deemed that charities are residuary beneficiaries of the estates in such cases and are therefore deemed to be the actual recipients of the income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We thought that the law was absolutely clear and that when the money went to the administrators of the estate the Inland Revenue would write through that and deal with the charities as though they were the actual recipients of the income. However, in section 80 of the Finance Act 1993, those deeming provisions appeared to have been overlooked, probably because of a draftsman's error. Under the 1993 Finance Act, the rate of tax credit was reduced from 25 to 20 per cent., but, in order to assist charities, the Government gave a transitional relief for five years. For the first five years, charities could claim at the higher rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, as I said, the 1993 Act was worded in such a way as not to incorporate the deeming provisions established by the 1988 Act. My new clause would correct that anomaly. I do not believe that the Government intended to discriminate against charities in that way. The anomaly causes considerable expense to some charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a non-pecuniary interest as a member of the board of management of the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals, which is a charity that provides treatment for animals at centres in every major conurbation in this country. People who would otherwise be unable to afford veterinary treatment—it is a rule that they must be in receipt of state benefit—can obtain it. The PDSA provides a valuable social function, which is currently inhibited by the anomaly. The PDSA currently pays £150,000 a year in tax on bequests. Therefore, what I believe is a draftsman's error has cost the PDSA £30,000. That money would pay for many animal treatments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will be as helpful on this matter as they were on a previous new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>814</span>
for explaining the purpose of his new clause because—as I think he would recognise—it is imprecise as drafted and it is therefore defective as an amendment to the law. However, I understand my hon. Friend's purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that when the rate of tax on dividends was reduced from 25 to 20 per cent. in the Finance Act 1993 we introduced a special relief for charities to ease the transition to the lower rate, which tapers down over four years. The purpose behind that relief, as was made clear at the time, was to help charities adjust to the change in the value of the tax credit. We recognised that charities had immediate obligations which had to be met and that it would take time for them to adjust their investments accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, for two reasons those considerations do not apply to payments that charities receive as residuary beneficiaries of estates. First, those payments are not themselves dividends, even though they may be funded out of dividends paid into the pool of money collected by the executors of the deceased person. There is no analogy between the payments received by the charity from the residuary estate and those received from direct dividend investments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason for the difference in treatment is that, unlike dividends on investments, charities do not rely heavily on residuary income from estates to meet their obligations. A charity will often not be aware in advance that it is a residuary beneficiary under a will and it certainly cannot know how much of the income will be derived from bequests, so such gains are more in the way of windfall gains and quite unlike the stream of investment income on which charities relied before the tax change. That is why the Government responded by only tapering out the investment relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I hear what my hon. Friend says, I must correct him because it is not factually the case. The PDSA, among many major charities, relies overwhelmingly on bequests as a source of income. There is a system of tracking those bequests over many years and the PDSA is able to forecast with considerable accuracy what its income from that source will be. It would not be able to function without that income. Not only the PDSA is in that position: I estimate that well over half the major charities in the United Kingdom are reliant on bequests in that way and know accurately what their income is likely to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not quite the point that I was trying to make. When a charity has a pool of investments from which it derives dividend income, it can build up obligations to match those dividends. I readily concede that many charities rely on bequests, but when that is the case they cannot predict with the same accuracy when someone will die, what the bequest will be and to what extent the residuary estate may be funded from dividend income. There is not the matching predictability between income and obligations that exists in the case of dividend investments. That is one reason why the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1994-1995V003P0I0963">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>815</span>
difference of treatment was introduced when the tax change was made in 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the reasons behind the new clause and I have some sympathy with my hon. Friend, but, for the two reasons that I have given, I cannot accept it as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I understand that the new clause as drafted may not entirely achieve the objective that I had intended, but it is quite clear that for all other tax purposes the 1988 Act deemed that the income would be treated as though it had been received by the charity, even though it has for the time being been received by the personal representatives of the estate. Therefore, it seems to me that the Government are being neither consistent nor even handed. However, as it is defective and in the hope that my hon. Friend will look at the matter again, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My final word is about my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Mr. Conway), the Government whip. We spoke earlier about films. We may all remember a film called "The Great Escape", in which some allied prisoners were in a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany, presided over by a decent, but essentially lenient, officer from the Luftwaffe. Under his regime, the great escape took place and, at the end of the film, the Gestapo removed him to replace him with someone from the SS. I was slightly worried on Tuesday afternoon when two of my hon. Friends, timing their run between the sweep of the searchlights, managed to get over the wire. At least, one of them got over the wire and the other under it. I was worried that this morning, instead of seeing the smiling face of my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham, I would see the Lord Commissioner, the hon. Member for Staffordshire, South-East (Mr. Lightbown), a man who looks even more frightening when he smiles. With my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham, the one thing we always looked forward to with great enthusiasm was his motion that we do adjourn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. I add my thanks and those of my hon. Friends to those which have been given to yourself and to Mr. Hogg for your conduct of our proceedings, which has been wise, firm, clear and fair, and which has contributed to the good spirit of the Committee. I should also like to add our thanks to the Clerk and his colleagues for their helpful advice, to the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters who have made sense of even our more convoluted moments, and to the aspirant actors among us who have given us something to think about. I also thank the attendants, who have done their job so well.

I should like to thank those who advised the Opposition. They have made up in energy and dedication what they

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>819</span>
have lacked in numbers. They have been more than a match for the combined weight of the Treasury, Customs and Exicise and the Inland Revenue. I am most grateful to my hon. Friends on both Front and Back Benches. I should like to commend in particular the contributions of our by-election victors who were mentioned at the outset. They have shown both why they won their by-elections and why they have so much to offer the House in the future. We have won the arguments even where we have lost the votes. We were pleased to join the hon. Member for Beaconsfield when he managed to win the vote as well as the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been some notable absences from our proceedings. I refer not just to the Chief Secretary being absent for the debate on overnight expenses, but to the Liberal Democrats who, by choosing not to be here, have shown their own assessment of how little they have to contribute to our proceedings. It s a great pity. The electorate, as ever, will be their judge.

The financial Secretary likened being on the Government Benches to being in a prison camp. Liberation is at hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful on my own behalf and that of my co-Chairman for the generous remarks that have been made by the Financial Secretary and by the hon. Member for Oxford, East. I can only say, again speaking also on behalf of my co-Chairman, that it has been a pleasure to Chair the Committee on what is clearly the most important Bill in the parliamentary year. I am advised by my Clerk that there have been 25 sittings, which is a record—although I accept that the structure of Committees have changed this year because of Topling. Overall, the mood of the Committee has been positive and constructive. From the Chair, and again speaking also for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>820</span>
my co-Chairman, I should like to thank all those who have contributed to the debates during the 25 sittings. It has been a very complicated, although perhaps less controversial Finance Bill than normal, but nevertheless very constructive debates have taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I particularly thank my Clerk. A Committee Chairman is very dependant on an able and alert Clerk. We have from time to time shaken each other up. Occasionally, I have had to bring him back to what we are doing here and occasionally he has had to do the same with me. As the Financial Secretary said, the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters are responsible for ensuring that posterity sees the best of our speeches—or should I say for ensuring that the speeches that we make are presented in the best possible way. We are grateful to them for the work that they do. Likewise, I thank the attendants, doorkeepers and the police, who ensure an orderly Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without further ado I thank members of the Committee on behalf of my fellow Chairman for the way that the Committee has proceeded during its 25 sittings. I shall miss it in the immediate future; my week will not be the same. I thank hon. Members and, in particular, the Front Benches for the difficult job that they have done. The Government obviously have a lot of support, so I echo the hon. Member for Oxford, East in thanking those who advise the Opposition. It is never easy on such a complicated and lengthy Bill.

I have one further task to do, which is to put the Question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
