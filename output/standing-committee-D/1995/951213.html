The Income-related Benefits Schemes and Social Security (Claims and Payments) (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1995</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Income-related Benefits Schemes and Social Security (Claims and Payments) (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995, No. 2303).</p></blockquote>
I always welcome you to the Chair of any Committee on which I am serving, Sir David.<br><br>
The regulations are complicated and it would be helpful if the Minister could give the Committee a brief introductory resume of their effects. We may wish to ask questions on them afterwards.</span></p>
<p>4.31 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Roger Evans)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The regulations are, on the surface, confusing. They contain miscellaneous amendments to a variety of regulations across all the income-related benefits. The draftsman has sensibly grouped the measures according to the relevant benefit from regulation 2 onwards. However, it might be easier for the Committee if I summarised the measures by topic, although some of the topics cover all the regulations.<br><br>
Taking the topics in the order in which they first arise, I shall begin with regulation 2(11)(b), which alters the wording of a rule applied to council tax benefit. The change will apply the same wording that is used for income support and housing benefit. Schedule 5(27) of the Council Tax Benefit Regulations provides for a capital disregard rule for any premises which the claimant intends to occupy as his home to which essential repairs or alterations are required to render them fit for such occupation. That is a well-known provision. The current wording allows that disregard
<br><blockquote><p>"for such period as is necessary to enable those repairs or alterations to be carried out".</p></blockquote>
The new regulation substitutes the following words:
<br><blockquote><p>"for a period of 26 weeks from the date on which the claimant first takes steps to effect those repairs or alterations, or such longer period as is necessary to enable those repairs or alterations to be carried out"</p></blockquote>
In other words, the new regulation is a simplification, putting the rule on the same footing as the provisions for income support and housing benefit.<br><br>
The next topic is found in regulation 3(7), amending schedule 1 of the Disability Working Allowance Regulations 1991, which lists the disabilities that put a person at a disadvantage in getting a job. Paragraph 6 provides for someone who, due to a lack of manual
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
dexterity, is unable to pick up "with each hand" a coin not more than 2.5 cm in diameter. Our concern is that the present wording suggests that the person has to be unable to perform the task with both hands. The amendment makes it clear that the disability need be in one hand only to fall within the qualification. The new wording is:
<br><blockquote><p>"with one hand, pick up"</p></blockquote>
in place of:
<br><blockquote><p>"pick up with each hand".</p></blockquote>
Again, the measure is designed as an easement.<br><br>
Regulations 4(7) and 3(8) deal with a purely technical matter relating to the treatment of the jobmatch allowance, which is a new scheme run by the Department for Education and Employment in four pilot areas from April this year. It involves people who are unemployed for two years or more and who then obtain work of between 16 and 30 hours a week. They are paid an allowance of £50 a week for 26 weeks as a stepping stone to full-time work. The scheme is part of the Government's wider programme of incentives to get people back to work.<br><br>
Someone returning to work may also be eligible for family credit or disability working allowance, which are also awarded for 26 weeks. Our intention is that the jobmatch allowance should be taken into account in the assessment of family credit and disability working allowance, but because the periods do not quite fit neatly, it is theoretically possible for the jobmatch allowance to be taken into account twice. The amendment prevents that.<br><br>
Regulations 5(4) and 7 transfer responsibility for assessing housing benefit in the case of assured shorthold tenancies from rent assessment committees to rent officers. There are only 14 rent assessment committees in England and Wales, and the expanded rent officer service, which deals with the majority of housing benefit matters, is, in the Government's view, the appropriate body to deal with that responsibility, because it has the relevant database and expertise.<br><br>
Regulation 5(10) defines the term "denied access" in cases involving housing benefit; it is a small classic of parliamentary draftsmanship and it addresses some of the problems that may arise. Rent officers need access to accommodation to do their job. Regulation 95(7) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 provides for local authorities to withhold housing benefit when a rent officer has been denied access. In the case of Muldoon and Kelly, involving Liverpool City Council, one of the claimants was in hospital and the other was in custody. The question was whether either had denied access or whether they had simply not afforded access. Denial, as the regulations stand, implies some action on behalf of the claimant, rather than non-action. That is not a very satisfactory state of affairs and the regulations define "denial". Reference to a rent officer being "denied entry" to a dwelling is defined as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"upon giving 7 days notice to the claimant or landlord, as the case may be, of the need to obtain such entry; and … no good reason is shown why entry cannot be given, the rent officer is unable to gain entry to the dwelling for making a determination to which that paragraph refers."</p></blockquote>
A careful provision for notice is also made. In other words, denial will be sufficient to stop benefit, but there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0316">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
is proper provision for an appropriate forwarding notice, which seems a sensible compromise.<br><br>
Regulation 5(12) is a small but important drafting matter which will ensure that increases in payments of a war pension made in respect of dependants who are not members of a claimant's family will be fully disregarded.<br><br>
Regulation 6(4) makes provision across income-related benefits to exempt personal pension schemes and retirement annuity contracts from the general rule on notional income up to the age of 60. For example, with regard to income support, under regulation 42, a claimant is treated as possessing income of which he has deprived himself. With regard to income support, one is expected to make efforts to obtain any income that may be payable to one. Unless one has an exception for personal pension and retirement annuity contracts, most of the arrangements allow one to draw income, under certain circumstances, from the age of 50. The Government's view is that one should be able to accumulate one's pension fund until the age of 60 and that the rule should only apply thereafter. That is why we limited the exemption at that age, which is when the pensioner premium in income support becomes payable.<br><br>
Regulation 6(6) deals with the valuation of jointly owned property and reverses the Court of Appeal judgment about the Palfrey, Dowell and McDonnell cases. This might be regarded as the most important matter in the regulations, so I shall explain what it boils down to. The classic problem is that of a partner who goes into residential care or a nursing home and who leaves a partner behind. In that case, there is a special arrangement in the regulations to disregard the valuation of the home, which appears in regulation 10(4). If there is a child over 60, or a child or relative who is incapacitated, the special exemption provides the disregard.<br><br>
A difficult situation arose in the Palfrey case. Mr. Palfrey, a widower of some age, and his daughter, a lady in her 50s who was in employment, bought a house in joint names. Mr. Palfrey subsequently went into residential care. He had been on income support and continued on it. While he lived at home, it was disregarded as capital for the income support assessment. The question was what happened when he went into nursing care. It was decided that there was equity of just over £30,000.<br><br>
Regulation 52 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 is a special provision dealing with jointly held capital, and it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"where a claimant and one or more persons are beneficially entitled in possession to any capital asset they shall be treated as if each of them were entitled in possession to the whole beneficial interest therein in an equal share [and the foregoing provisions of this Chapter shall apply for the purposes of calculating the amount of capital which the claimant is treated as possessing as if it were actual capital which the claimant does possess.]"</p></blockquote>
I stress that that provision is important, despite sounding technical. It was argued on behalf of the Department that one takes the whole of the beneficial interest, that is, the equity of just over £30,000, and then divides it by the number of people who are entitled to it in equal shares—in this case a father and daughter, with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
the result that the father, Mr. Palfrey, would have just over £15,000.<br><br>
Mr. Palfrey argued that that was not the right way in which to calculate the value of his share. He said that it should be valued on the basis of his interest, which is neither marketable nor saleable because Miss Palfrey is living in the house, has a right to go on living in the house, does not propose to move out and is not going to sell. Therefore, the value of Mr. Palfrey's interest was, he argued, nil, and so held the Court of Appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Quite right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can understand why the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie) says that in response to the Court of Appeal's judgment in the Palfrey case, but the point to be made is that this provision in the income support capital rules applies to any asset of any value. It would be an extraordinary judgment in a case such as the taxation case of Walton <i>v</i> the Inland Revenue Commissioners, which the Court of Appeal decided this week. The case hinged on the valuation of a non-marketable share in a farming partnership for capital transfer tax purposes—in other words, families can make arrangements to ensure that a part share is not marketable. Are we really going to allow people to hold possibly large sums, or capital assets in the case of land, in such a way as to defeat the capital rules? The Government do not believe that that is right, hence regulation 6(6) reverses that rule.<br><br>
Regulation 6(10) deals with another point that emerged from the Court of Appeal decision to which I have referred, which is the definition of any reversionary interest. Schedule 10 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 deals with capital which is to be disregarded. There is a long list of items—I shall go through it if necessary, but would prefer to avoid doing so—one of which is paragraph 5, which simply states, "Any reversionary interest." On the basis of the commissioners' decisions in 1983 and 1986, that was thought not to include the value of a house that is let. However, the Court of Appeal held that there was no reason to attach to the wording of the regulation a special or restricted meaning, and that the common and general legal meaning of the term should be applied. Therefore, when a landlord has let his or her house to a tenant, he or she is left with a reversionary interest. Are we to disregard that completely? That was the effect of the Court of Appeal's decision.<br><br>
If one is the last member of a family and one goes into care, is one allowed simply to put one's house out to let? According to the Court of Appeal, the value of the house would be disregarded. The situation might be worse than that—it is important to remember that these rules apply to all those receiving income support, not only to the elderly. If the Court of Appeal's decision had stood, in cases concerning a landlord who had a series of houses or flats, the actual capital value of the reversion would be wholly disregarded. That alteration would create a substantial loophole through which a coach and six could be driven. Those wishing to remove capital from consideration by using schedule 10—in which the items listed are disregarded for the purposes of assessing capital—would put their money into homes
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0317">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
or flats that were let. That cannot be right, and regulation 6(10) substitutes the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any future interest in property of any kind, other than land or premises in respect of which the claimant has granted a subsisting lease or tenacy".</p></blockquote>
We suggest that that is a sensible compromise.<br><br>
I have nearly finished, but some other, minor matters are dealt with by the regulations. Regulations 6(7), 6(8) and 6(9) provide that people who are treated as incapable of work will be exempt from having to be available for work and will therefore be eligible for the disability premium in the same way as those who are incapable of work. Those are classically the people who are not subject to the incapacity test because of the manifest severity of their condition or because they are carrying an infectious disease.<br><br>
Regulation 7 is a transitional provision to allow local authorities to use determinations made by rent assessment committees prior to the coming into force of the regulations.<br><br>
Regulations 8 and 9 are minor technical drafting amendments, of a beneficial nature, to make the cross-references to the new incapacity benefit more appropriate. I have tried to summarise the position and I believe that I have covered every point.</span></p>
<p>4.46 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Gale <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Thanet)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I place on record my concern that matters of such complexity come before Standing Committees in such an incomprehensible form. I do not know how many members of the Committee have taken the trouble to read the regulations, but I have. I am a bear of small brain; long words bother me and jumbled statistics and regulations bother me a lot. The complexity in the cross-references is incomprehensible to me. I am prepared to put that on the record because it is time that someone did.<br><br>
I was fortunate in being able to discuss the matter prior to our sitting with my hon. Friend the Minister, who is more assiduous than most hon. Members on both sides of the House. I know that he has done his homework and has checked the cross-references thoroughly. I am grateful to him for explaining the matter in words that I can understand. That is not always so and, far too frequently these days, what used to be known as statutory instruments come before the House in a form that most of us cannot understand and do not have the resources to analyse. That is inherently dangerous and it is time that we said so.<br><br>
Legislation has recently gone through the House on the nod—I was involved in the publicity surrounding some of it—which we discovered, far too late in the day, was not what we had anticipated or were led to believe. I foresee hon Members receiving queries from members of the public who are affected by such legislation. We shall say how shocking the matter is and write to the Minister—but not to my hon. Friend because he has explained the matter. The Minister may say, "Hang on, old son, you voted for it", or, "It was properly scrutinised and approved."<br><br>
I want to put down a marker this afternoon that it would be helpful if Ministers were able to make
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
available to members of Standing Committees before they sit the sort of information that we have received this afternoon so that we can understand the legislation. Otherwise, Members of Parliament, who are elected to do a job on behalf of their constituents, irrespective of party politics, are faced with an impossible task.<br><br>
I want to raise two matters to which I know that my hon. Friend will be able to respond. One is relevant to those of my constituents who are elderly and own property, and who have to go into a nursing home. Thirty per cent. of the population of North Thanet are over retirement age. Some are single elderly people and some are couples, some of whom are parent and daughter. In these days of good medical care, the daughter may be over retirement age. An elderly ladyma—may go into care, leaving the daughter in possession of half a house. What happens to a jointly owned property and how it is apportioned is a matter of great concern.<br><br>
I understand the case that my hon. Friend made about the need to define clearly what is non-marketable. Is that non-marketable for the duration of the remaining occupant's lifetime or is the assessment made when one partner goes into care? How is the value fixed? If dad goes into a nursing home, and the daughter remains in the property, at what point is the value of the property and, therefore, the amount apportioned, fixed? Is it when the person goes into the nursing home, or is it initially theoretical and then fixed on the person's death or on resale of the property?<br><br>
I entirely understand and support my hon. Friend the Minister's reference under regulation 6(10) to the reversionary interest. It would be wrong to allow somebody to let a property, but to escape the duty to the public purse by claiming that it was non-marketable. That I understand.<br><br>
My final point refers to regulation 5(10) about the denial of access to property and the assessment of housing benefit as a result. As I understand my hon. Friend's comments, where, under existing regulations, a local authority is denied access to a property for the purposes of assessing housing benefit, the local authority has the right to deny that benefit. I believe that that is right—the taxpayer should not be required to pay housing benefit when the local authority has not had the opportunity properly to assess the level of that benefit.<br><br>
I have a specific constituency case which prompts me to raise that matter. In good faith, a landlord let his home on a short-term basis on a holiday let. Foolishly, I accept, he did not take sound legal advice, so found himself with a shorthold lease instead of a very short-term let. The tenant, who has a track record and is a crook, went to the local authority with a forged rental agreement. As I understand it, the local authority made no attempt whatever to check the validity of the rental agreement with the landlord. What responsibility does a local authority have to check a housing benefit application before awarding benefit? If my hon. Friend can tell us that the local authority has a responsibility, it might help me and my constituent considerably.</span></p>
<p>4.53 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the contribution from the hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale) and make a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0318">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
slightly wider point, too. Because of the increase in regulations which appear through primary legislation, much of the detail comes through later in statutory instruments. Therefore, when we consider primary legislation, much of the detail that we want to discuss is not available. Many statutory instruments amend other statutory instruments because of omissions and errors in drafting. Were there further consideration of the original regulations, there might be less need for so many subsequent amending regulations.<br><br>
I reinforce the point about the capital value of a house. The Minister appeared to justify the Government's attitude by comparing houses with other assets, but there is a specific problem because a house is many people's sole asset. The Government recognised the general problem and changed the capital rules through the Budget. Even so, the specific example given by the hon. Member for North Thanet and similar examples from other hon. Members' constituents of families being left in the home and the subsequent effect on its value is a specific problem. Although the Court of Appeal has dealt with the specific case raised by the Minister, I suspect that there may be other challenges in the courts to decide how assets are determined in future.<br><br>
I reinforce our concerns about the nature of long-term care and how assets are treated, in particular the one asset that most families, certainly those in my constituency, have—the house, which should be considered separately and not confused with other assets and how they may be treated in regulations. I shall welcome further comment by the Minister on that and look forward to hearing other views he may have as the person responsible for many of the regulations which will flow through to us.<br><br>
I have several questions on another statutory instrument which I thought we might deal with this afternoon. They will be ready for the Minister in a future debate. I share the concerns expressed and hope that he will want other mechanisms to be used to ensure proper parliamentary scrutiny of these important matters.</span></p>
<p>4.56 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also share the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for North Thanet. Having dealt with several statutory instruments and having served on Committees on social security legislation over the years, I realise that there is now more and more regulation than actual decisions made in Standing Committees. It is often months, if not years, before regulation trickles down to the clients whom we have to put up with in our surgeries. I am glad that the feedback from Members of Parliament is that the way in which we have been treating regulations through statutory instruments must be reconsidered.<br><br>
As for access, how far down the road does an officer go to ensure that an appointment system, or whatever, is in operation? Some cases that I have had to deal with could not be worked out in any way, because people could not make appointments and because the department said merely that an officer would be present. Often, in cases that involve care, officers can be present only for a specific time—perhaps an hour on a specific
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
day. That is not allowed and the guilty person is the client. Will the Minister tell officers that there needs to be a reasonable arrangement for access to deal with the problem?</span></p>
<p>4.58 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with hon. Members' points quickly. I accept that there is a formidable problem with the complexity of statutory instruments. I listened to the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) telling me that in his constituency, the home is usually the only asset and that it should be dealt with separately. The income support regulations and the one that we are discussing under the context of valuing jointly held property deal with all jointly held property, whether it be held by a private company, or is a great landed estate or someone's cottage. It makes no difference. The difficulty is that Members of Parliament make the solid point that a particular situation which concerns them should be dealt with separately. That difficulty accumulates and results in increasingly complex rules as we try to deal with particular cases. The problem is not as simple as it may seem.<br><br>
I appreciate the concern of hon. Members about this statutory instrument. If one tries to read it without the benefit of what it refers to, it is frankly, incomprehensible—I readily concede that—and it is not the happiest way in which to deal with the matters. But the regulation is at the end of a difficult process of drafting. I assure the Committee that such matters are considered with care within the Department. All I can say is that we must do better.<br><br>
As for denial of access, my hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet took the point that it was right that local authorities and, therefore, taxpayers should not pay the housing benefit bill when someone refused access. The difficulty is to strike a balance. Some people were not told of visits. A rent officer would call but could not get in because the person he was visiting was in hospital—one of the two examples that led to litigation. No one can blame anyone for being in hospital and people are entitled to housing benefit during the type of short stay in hospital that we are discussing. In that case, the poor claimant was the innocent party in every sense. However, there are situations in which people play fast and loose with the rent officer and will not assist. Therefore, the compromise proposed in the regulations is giving notice.<br><br>
I heard what the hon. Member for Heeley said. One problem for all of us who live busy lives is what happens when various people want to come into our homes to do different things at different times. Some common sense is required. The situation is the responsibility of the rent officer service, for which the Department of Environment is responsible. But I will make inquiries and write to the hon. Gentleman to tell him what the precise practice is for making appointments.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Thanet raised two further points about valuation. He asked about the date of the valuation. The date is the date of the income support assessment. Of course it can be revised later, but it is the date on which there is a change in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0319">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
circumstances that leads to a change in the amount payable. For example, if one were to go into residential care or a nursing home, as in the example quoted of the father and daughter there would be a fresh review and a new assessment of the father's income support arrangements, which would be the date of the valuation. However, there is a real difficulty. My hon. Friend talked about leaving a daughter in possession of half the house. If the daughter is over 60, or if she is incapacitated, that is disregarded. But what do we do in the case of a couple, a father and a young, active child, in the prime of life and earning large sums, or in possession of a large and valuable house? Should we disregard the father's half interest in the house altogether? That seems to go too far towards the other extreme, although I appreciate that there is much concern on the topic, which the Government have recognised with the Budget alteration on capital.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to press the Minister slightly further because this is extremely important. As I understand it, the valuation is initially made when the claimant is admitted to nursing care. If I go into nursing care and my daughter, who is much younger than me,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
has a half interest in my home, the value of the home could fluctuate considerably during the time that she occupies it on her own and may wish to dispose of it. In the past, it has generally been assumed that property prices rise but, during the past five years, property prices have fallen. So it would seem much more sensible to apportion ownership at the point of sale, on a real rather than a theoretical value.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. We should remember that it is a notional calculation carried out for the purpose of an instant assessment for income support. That assessment can, of course, be reviewed. It may change in the light of changed circumstances at a later date, in which case the valuation at the later date will be the one that is material. It is not cast in concrete for ever. I hope that answers the points raised.</span></p>
