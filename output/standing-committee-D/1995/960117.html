Draft Gas (Northern Ireland) Order 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Malcolm Moss)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>"That the Committee has considered the draft Gas (Northern Ireland) Order 1996."</p></blockquote>
The order introduces new provisions designed to provide the legislative and regulatory framework for the development of a natural gas industry in Northern Ireland. Unlike the rest of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland has never has a natural gas industry. However, the privatisation and reconstruction of the Northern Ireland electricity supply industry have given rise to the conversion of Ballylumford power station from oil to gas firing, which is now taking place and will also provide an opportunity to develop a commercially viable downstream natural gas industry. An undersea gas pipeline which has been constructed from Scotland to Northern Ireland will have sufficient capacity to meet the requirements of both the power station and a downstream industry supplying industrial, commercial and domestic customers. The objective is for first supplies of gas to reach the downstream market in late 1996 or early 1997.<br><br>
The Government are committed to ensuring that that opportunity to develop a natural gas industry in Northern Ireland is grasped firmly. That will give people in Northern Ireland the same choice of fuels as in the rest of the United Kingdom; the competition that gas will provide can lead only to a lowering of total energy bills. The Government's aim is therefore to facilitate, through the passage of the draft Order, the development of a new gas industry as rapidly and extensively as possible, including the introduction of third party access to pipeline systems, and gas on gas competition, at the earliest stage. In doing so, the Government fully recognise the challenging task in establishing a new gas industry from scratch, particularly in the face of strong competition from other fuels such as electricity, oil and coal which are long established in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
The draft order incorporates a number of provisions contained in the Pipe-lines Act 1962 and the Gas Act 1986, as amended by the Gas Act 1995, which provide the framework for the natural gas industry in Great Britain. Crucially, however, it also reflects the requirement to develop an entirely new natural gas industry in Northern Ireland compared to the existing mature industry which is the focus of the British legislation.<br><br>
Overall, the draft order seeks to provide a balanced framework that will facilitate and encourage the development of the new gas industry while providing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
essential consumer safeguards and ensuring high health and safety standards. Its principal provisions would establish a licensing regime for the conveyance, storage and supply of gas; provide for the appointment of a regulator and require the regulator and the Department of Economic Development to promote the development and maintenance of an efficient, economic and co-ordinated gas industry in Northern Ireland, and to facilitate competition; place duties on the regulator and the General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland to safeguard the interests of gas consumers; and provide the Department of Economic Development with necessary health and safety powers in relation to the new industry. Detailed regulatory arrangements will be contained in licences granted by the Department of Economic Development under the order.<br><br>
The draft order incorporates a number of amendments based on comments received as a result of the widespread public consultation. I am pleased that the response to the public consultation was supportive of the proposed introduction of the order. The establishment of a natural gas industry, will lead to the creation, both directly and indirectly, of hundreds of new jobs. Overall, it will bring an added dimension to the economic well-being of Northern Ireland and I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.35 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Eric Illsley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the order which, as the Minister said, provides the regulatory and licensing framework for the supply of natural gas into Northern Ireland. It replicates existing legislation on the supply of gas in the Pipe-lines Act 1962 and the Gas Act 1986, so we take issue with little in the order, although I shall come to one or two small matters in a moment.<br><br>
There is obviously much optimism surrounding the supply of gas to the Northern Ireland and it is hoped that a new industry will develop. Premier Energy has drawn attention to a number of matters that it believes will arise as a result of the supply of gas—a choice of fuels, the eventual appearance of an element of competition in energy supply in Northern Ireland, opportunities for employment and for energy efficiency, and improved living standards.<br><br>
However, Premier Energy also notes that there is a downside. It predicts that the gas supply to Northern Ireland will be expensive, and even uneconomic in some areas. Therefore, I am worried that consumers in the Province, who already pay more than the rest of the United Kingdom for electricity, are likely to face higher charges for gas than elsewhere, at least in the short term. Moreover, gas suppliers will either demand monopoly rights in Northern Ireland, or a light or non-existent regulatory regime.<br><br>
The supply of natural gas to Northern Ireland has arisen from the needs of power generation. The pipeline to Northern Ireland is designed to supply gas to Ballylumford power station. One reason for that is the directive covering large combustion plants, which would require Ballylumford to close down by 2003
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0178">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
unless it reduces its emissions. Ballylumford supplies about 45 per cent of Northern Ireland's electricity, so it was essential that action was taken.<br><br>
The gas pipeline into Ballylumford will allow for a long-overdue fuel mix in power generation in Northern Ireland. The reliance on coal and heavy fuel oil has led to price difficulties for consumers in the Province. Under the power purchase agreements, all Ballylumford's output is contracted to Northern Ireland Electricity until at least 2010. So the cost of the gas pipeline through to the power station will be passed straight on to Northern Ireland Electricity and then on to gas or electricity consumers in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
The PPAs are unregulated. When Northern Ireland's electricity industry was privatised, no regulations as to generation were imposed. Some existing contracts will last until 2024, and the Ballylumford contract will continue until 2010. That lack of regulation contract will continue until 2010. That lack of regulation of supplies into Ballylumford means that costs can be passed straight through to the consumer.<br><br>
The Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs considered that problem when it produced a report examining electricity prices in Northern Ireland. Some of the Committee's comments are worthy of attention. For example, it stated that, part from the European grant towards the cost of the pipeline,
<br><blockquote><p>"the electricity customer in Northern Ireland effectively underwrites the total cost of bringing gas to Northern Ireland. If no other gas usage develops, the electricity customer will bear the total cost of the gas pipeline."</p></blockquote>
Obviously, it is hoped that other gas usage in the downstream market will develop, thus rendering the pass-through of costs less severe than envisaged. However, the report also states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The cost of the gas will, of course, be passed directly through to the electricity consumer."</p></blockquote>
So there is no doubt that the cost of the Ballylumford pipeline will be passed through to the electricity consumer. The structure of electricity prices in Northern Ireland over the medium term means that those prices are set to rise even further, as a result of flue gas desulphurisation and the cost of the gas supply pipeline. That cost will be borne by Northern Ireland consumers, who already pay a higher price for electricity than consumers in the rest of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
It has been suggested that the downstream market develops with the gas market and that it will compete with electricity for domestic consumption—central heating, gas cookers and other appliances. As gas usage increases, furthermore, electricity prices decrease. Because British Gas, however, owns the pipeline and supply into Northern Ireland, as well as Ballylumford power station, which supplies 45 per cent. of the country's electricity, it already has something of a monopoly British Gas is, indeed, on record as saying that it will contact the Government about obtaining a monopoly. On 20 November last year an article headed.
<br><blockquote><p>"Brit Gas considers Belfast expansion"</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
appeared in the <i>Financial Times.</i> It stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"British Gas will be raising with the Northern Ireland government the question of a monopoly distribution rights in the initial years to compensate it for the investment costs".</p></blockquote>
Although British Gas owns the gas supply system to Northern Ireland and an unfair amount of power generation facilities, it is reportedly asking the Government for monopoly rights on distribution.<br><br>
British Gas's subsidiary, Premier Energy suppliers, talks of phased competition, The Minister refers to third party access being up and running as quickly as possible, but British Gas and Premier Energy suppliers are looking for exactly the opposite—monopoly rights and phased competition to recoup the cost of bringing gas to Northern Ireland.<br><br>
Premier Energy suppliers says that substantial risks are involved in supplying gas to Northern Ireland, but that is questionable, because the country has been waiting for the gas pipeline for some time and people are keen for the gas supply to be established. It is unclear why Premier Energy suppliers should face substantial risks when it seeks monopoly distribution rights and phased competition.<br><br>
The explanatory document on the order says that detailed regulatory arrangements will be reflected in the licences that will be granted under the terms of the order. Page 1 refers to "a minimum of regulation". It seems, therefore, in the explanatory document and terms of regulation, that the Government are considering a light regulatory regime to allow Premier Energy suppliers and British Gas to recoup their costs. It seems that Northern Ireland consumers will pay for the installation of gas facilities, but will receive minimal regulation.<br><br>
The Minister and I were members of the Select Committee on Energy, and he will recall that we discussed tariff rates for industrial and commercial users of gas. That discussion provided an example of the benefits of regulation—particularly in the gas industry. It was only at the insistence of the gas regulator in this country that British Gas altered its tariff structure to prevent flaring—companies burning off and effectively wasting gas, so that their consumption levels increased and took them into a cheaper payment band in British Gas's tariff scheme. There is, therefore, a real need for us to consider regulation.<br><br>
It is amazing that no regulation was placed on the owners of the four power stations when the Northern Ireland electricity industry was privatised. Regardless of what happens with gas and electricity, those contracts will exist long into the next century.<br><br>
Regulation with regard to the domestic supply side of the industry and the downstream market is contained in the order. As far as I can see, it mirrors the Gas Act 1986; indeed, many of the clauses are identical. Once again, the explanatory document refers to a very light system of regulation. Page 17 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"To facilitate and encourage the development of a new industry in Northern Ireland it is intended that the regulatory regime provided under the proposed Order would be less intrusive than the regime prevailing in Great Britain."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0179">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
It goes on to say that regulatory matters will be dealt with by provisions in licences granted under the proposed order. The Government seem to be saying there that the regulatory regime in this country is intrusive and that they do not want a similar system in Northern Ireland. Why does the Minister believe that this country's regulatory system is intrusive? Why is that same regulation inappropriate for Northern Ireland?<br><br>
British Gas has had a virtual monopoly in this country and tensions have arisen between it and Ofgas on, for example, the flaring to which I referred earlier. A similar monopoly will now arise in Northern Ireland. Are the Government saying that they want to reduce the tensions of that monopoly situation by having a light, or non-existent, regulatory regime? I find it difficult to understand how the industry can be regulated if the regulator is not intrusive. By the nature of his job, he would have to examine the affairs of Premier Energy Suppliers, the subsidiary of British Gas in Northern Ireland, to regulate them. Northern Ireland consumers will be given the downstream gas industry at very high cost and with no regulation. As I said, when electricity privatisation took place in Northern Ireland, the generators were left without regulation, which has resulted in ever-increasing electricity prices.<br><br>
Paragraph 7.10 of the consultative document on a natural gas industry in Northern Ireland, which was published in July 1994, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Price regulation should only be restored to when unavoidable market features protect operators from the winds of competition. It is for debate whether regulation to determine the price at which gas is supplied to final consumers is necessary to protect the interests of consumers during the industry's development phase."</p></blockquote>
I do not think that it is a matter for debate. Such regulation is necessary and should be in place.<br><br>
There are one or two minor issues arising from the order that I should like to raise. First, article 24 deals with the resale of gas; under it, the director will be able to stipulate the retail price of gas. Any excess price can be recoverable, together with interest paid, by the injured party. However, there is no mention of any penalty against the person who is reselling gas over and above the price set by the director. Does the Minister think, as I do, that there ought to be a penalty to discourage the resale of gas at prices above the set levels? People will realise that they have been overcharged only if they have reference to the director's price and they may or may not then take action to recover the overpricing.<br><br>
Secondly, article 40(4) refers to an assembly. Will the Minister say what assembly that is?<br><br>
Finally, I should like to raise the matter of Beaufort's dyke and the problems that have occurred as a result of a pipeline being laid from Scotland to Northern Ireland. The Minister will be well aware that the laying of that pipeline disturbed what appears to be a munitions dump which has been in Beaufort's dyke since the end of the first world war.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Is the Minister satisfied that the pipeline is secure and that there is no risk to it from anything contained in the munitions dump? Is he also satisfied that the munitions dump is secure and that there is little likelihood of any reoccurrence of the munitions being disturbed as at Beauforts' dyke? I understand that responsibility for the pipeline rests with the Department of Trade and Industry and that if the Department is not satisfied that the pipeline is secure, a licence will not be provided.<br><br>
Can the Minister reassure us about the safety of the pipeline in the event of repair or maintenance work being required? Again, I want an assurance that Beaufort's dyke will not be disturbed. Will the Government take any action either to secure the munitions dump or to salvage and destroy it?</span></p>
<p>4.51 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party, I took the opportunity to respond to the draft proposal issued in 1995. I broadly welcome it, but regret that it is now emerging in the form of an Order in Council rather than a Bill.<br><br>
We see the entry of natural gas into the Northern Ireland energy market as creating diversification, providing industrial competition, reducing atmospheric pollution and creating jobs. Many householders in Northern Ireland will certainly welcome the opportunity in the longer term to convert their domestic supply from bottled gas to natural gas. Many consumers are worried that they are being ripped off by prices currently charged for bottled gas.<br><br>
In my response, I recommended minor changes in the roles of the Department and the director. I was pleased to receive a detailed response from the Minister for the Environment who confirmed acceptance of a minor amendment. It has been honoured in the order before us, which I welcome. We look forward to the establishment of an efficient and successful new industry in Northern Ireland, ultimately bringing about competition and reducing prices.<br><br>
We share the concern that has been expressed about recent disclosures of munitions across the sea bed between Scotland and Northern Ireland—the munitions were supposed to be in Beaufort's dyke, but we are unsure precisely where they all are. We know only where some of them have been dumped. We want some assurance that, whatever steps or actions may be necessary in future, the Government will guarantee the security of the supply and the safety of the pipeline and of those who of necessity may have to work on it. The responsibility must be taken by the Government to ensure that secure supplies get to Northern Ireland.<br><br>
The terms and conditions under which the generating companies who are privileged to get established in Northern Ireland operate have played a big part in the higher prices that we pay. We would like the director and indeed the regulator to look closely at the monopoly position which British Gas and its subsidiary companies will enjoy in Northern Ireland.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0180">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
We would expect the interests of consumers to be given priority at all times. I welcome the order and I look forward to its succesful outome.</span></p>
<p>4.56 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Moss</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the support in general terms given by Opposition Members to this long-overdue order for Northern Ireland which will bring it into line with the rest of the United Kingdom and will mean that consumers will have a broad choice of energy supplies for the first time.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr illsley) posed quite a list of questions. I shall deal with as many as I can, but I shall write to him about those I do not cover. He first talked about price control and the fact that gas supply might be expensive. In terms of controlling prices, we believe that the development competition between fuels and the different gas suppliers will make price controls unnecessary in Northern Ireland. The new gas industry that is going in will have to face competition from existing fuels and power suppliers and it will find it difficult to break into that well-established market. Nevertheless it would be open to the regulator to determine whether price controls should be introduced if competition between gas and other fuels fail to provide adequate control<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman spoke about monopoly rights. They are defined in the order as exclusive rights and he asked why the agreement between the Department of Economic Development and Premier Energy had to include those periods of exclusivity. It represents a recognition, first, of the commercial risks that are associated with such a major investment in the establishment of this new gas industry in Northern Ireland and in particular the Greater Belfast area. To reiterate what I said a moment ago it will face atrong competition from well-established fuels.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Illsley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to periods of exclusivity. How long does he have in mind for them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Moss</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that in a moment. We believe that the periods of exclusivity are necessary in the light of the commercial risks that will be faced by Premier Energy in the early years. The risks to British Gas are that the existing suppliers will have to fight for their share in a market where both coal and oil are relatively cheap.<br><br>
The exclusivity periods, as well as helping to ensure a firm base for the new industry, will have to be monitored over a period of time. They will also be subject to the consortium meeting pre-determined performance criteria, the first being the date by which gas will be available in each discrete geographical area. We intend to break up the region into discrete areas and we will measure how Premier Energy moves into them to provide gas to the population. That will be reflected in the number of offers that are made to connect customers and, perhaps most important of all, in the length of kilometres of pipeline laid.<br><br>
The agreement in principle reached with Premier provides for a three-year period in the introduction of competition in supplies to larger industrial and commercial consumers who use more that 250,000
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
therms a year. That period starts from the introduction of gas into their areas. For all other consumers, the period will be eight years from the operational startup. That means that if gas is provided on a commercial basis from the end of this year or early 1997, the eight years will run from that operational start-up date. For very large consumers, the period will be three years.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central referred several times to the regulatory regime. Yes, the order will provide a lighter regulatory approach. That is principally because the Government are making a private company to make a substantial investment of millions of pounds with no up-front guarantee of breaking significantly into the domestic market. Many well-established fuel suppliers already exist.<br><br>
We do not wish to impose major constraints in the way of that necessary market penetration and development. There will still be plenty of regulation, but the approach will be lighter than that in Great Britain. We are leaving a number of matters that are dealt with under legislation and licences in Great Britain to normal contractural arrangements between gas suppliers and their customers. That will include the terms on which gas is supplied and the methods and terms of payment for that. Rights of entry for other than safety purposes, such as meter reading, including the adjustment of readings when the meter has registered erroneously, and disconnections, will also be covered, as will the resolution of disputes between suppliers and customers. We intend to ensure that there is a statutory right of entry on any matter relating to health and safety.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central spoke at length about the Ballylumford power station and the agreements reached on it. It was bought by British Gas in 1992 when power stations in Northern Ireland were privatised under legislation. It was bought on terms that required it to convert from oil to gas and to build a gas pipeline to Northern Ireland. The Government set those objectives. The availability of gas in Northern Ireland increases competition and consumer choice. It also diversifies the fuel base and is good for the environment. That is why the Government set those objectives.<br><br>
All four power stations in Northern Ireland are contractually bound to sell power to Northern Ireland Electricity under long-term contracts that contain provisions governing the price of fuel. If that fuel is oil, reference is made to the spot market. The price of coal is determined by reference to the coal index and gas is referred to the British Gas tarriff LTI 3. No doubt, the hon. Gentleman is familiar with that.<br><br>
The Ballylumford contract contains provisions governing the conversion from oil to gas and there is no need for further negotiations. Although the contract is long term, as the hon. Gentleman said, it has a break point in the year 2010. Long-term contracts at fixed prices in real terms provide at least some stability and prevent prices from shooting up in future. The hon. Gentleman referred to the differential in electricity prices between Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain, but I inform him—I am sure that he is already aware of this—that electricity prices in

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
Northern Ireland are linked to the retail prices index. Therefore, they go up pretty much in line with inflation. The differential with Great Britain occurs because prices of electricity and fuel in general in Great Britain are going down. That is a direct concomitant of privatisation of the electricity supply industry in Great Britain.<br><br>
The hon Member for Barnsley, West said that gas consumers in Northern Ireland have to pay more than those in the rest of Britain. Clearly, the price of gas in Northern Ireland will be influenced by the need to recover the construction costs of the pipeline. The hon. Gentleman alluded to that. The pipeline will attract a European Union grant of 35 per cent. It is important to compare the price of gas to that of other fuels in Northern Ireland. The price of gas is not too far out of line with that of other fuels. If Premier Energy suppliers wish to make inroads into the market in Northern Ireland, they must set a price for their product that meets with consumer approval.<br><br>
The total cost of providing gas and developing the gas industry is approximately £320 million. A grant—approximately £65 million—will be provided for the pipeline and the cost of converting Ballylumford power station. A 35 per cent. grant will be provided for the Ballylumford to Belfast pipeline. That is approximately £15 million towards a total cost of £40 million. However, there will be no grant for expenditure on the distribution system—mainly for the Greater Belfast area—the cost of which is estimated at £100 million. Premier Energy suppliers must make a substantial investment in pipelines to ensure that the new fuel is available in the Greater Belfast area.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the resale of gas, and why the director was responsible for regulating the maximum charges at which gas could be resold when he did not initially regulate gas prices. That provision aims to protect tenants to whom landlords provide on-supply gas. It broadly reflects current United Kingdom gas and electricity statutes, including the Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Illsley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not question the inclusion of that provision; I welcome controls on the retail price of gas. I asked whether the measure should impose a penalty on a person who sold gas above the retail price that the director stipulated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moss</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. However, overcharging is more appropriately tackled through normal legal redress by the person who is confronted with increased costs. We intend to provide for that in the small claims court.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to article 40, which contains the word, "Assembly". I should like to write to the hon. Gentleman about that. However, I believe that Northern Ireland legislation is written in that way. The hon. Gentleman should know that Northern Ireland legislation is made differently from that of the rest of Britain; it is made either by affirmative or negative resolution. The separate body
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
of legislation always refers to the devolved Assembly in Northern Ireland, in case, with the agreement of the hon. Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs), it is set up again.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central referred to Beaufort's dyke. Many anxieties have been expressed in the media and in Parliament about the effects of laying a gas pipeline from Scotland to Northern Ireland on the munitions that lie along the route. The Government recently commissioned a marine laboratory survey of the Beaufort's dyke area. The results were published on 8th January at a press conference in Aberdeen. The Scottish Office, The Department of Trade and Industry, and the Health and Safety Executive were represented there. The survey's main conclusions showed that, from the analysis so far completed of sediments and marine life, there was no evidence that the munitions dumped in and around the dyke were contaminating the marine ecosystem. However, a less encouraging finding is a legacy of munitions outside the authorised dump site. Current scientific opinion supports the conclusion that dumped munitions are not a significant risk to human health and the marine environment if they are left undisturbed. The survey found no direct evidence that phosphorous objects recently washed up on either the Northern Ireland or the Scottish coast came from that area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is widespread dissatisfaction throughout Scotland about the survey and about its lack of comprehensiveness, with due respect to those who carried it out. Will the Minister assure us that the various Government Departments concerned, including the Scottish and Northern Ireland Offices, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department of Transport and the Ministry of Defence, will accord each other the maximum co-operation? I do not expect the Minister to go into great detail on the subject now, but he must realise that dissatisfaction exists in Scotland, and possibly elsewhere. It is up to the various Government Departments to get their act together to conduct further investigations with a view to getting to the root of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moss</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The responsibility of the Department of Economic Development in Northern Ireland starts only at the low water mark on the Antrim coast as the pipeline comes ashore. Responsibility for the pipeline itself is a matter for the Department of Trade and Industry, based at Westminster. I am told that the offshore pipeline work that was conducted by a company called Premier Transco accorded with strict procedures laid down by the Department of Trade and Industry, the Health and Safety Executive and the Ministry of Defence. It is, as I have said, primarily the responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry to grant approval for the bringing into use of the pipeline. Approval would be granted only if the Health and Safety Executive was satisfied that the company had met all its legal obligations for proper control of risks.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0182">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
There will be co-ordination between various Government Departments, but essentially the decision to allow gas through the pipeline will be taken by the Health and Safety Executive. I should not expect the hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) to question that body's integrity in the matter. The company concerned will be required to continue to comply with the authorities' requirements during the commissioning of the pipeline and during any operational phases of the project that may follow.<br><br>
I welcome the support of the hon. Member for East Antrim and thank him for his written submission to Baroness Denton, which was very helpful. I know that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
the pipeline is significant for his constituency, coming ashore as it does on the Islandmagee. Because of that and the new pipeline to the power station, the new pipeline into Belfast and, it is to be hoped, a connection to the town of Larne, his constituency will have gas for the first time. New jobs will be created for his constituents.</span></p>
