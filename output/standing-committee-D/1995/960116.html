	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>North Wales Fire Services (Combination Scheme) Order 1995</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Knowsley, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the North Wales Fire Services (Combination Scheme) Order 1995 (S.I., 1995, No. 3218).</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the South Wales Fire Services (Combination Scheme) Order 1995 (S.I., 1995, No. 3230).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is incumbent on the Opposition to explain why we have prayed against the order and why this Committee sitting today. In my discussions with colleagues who represent Welsh constituencies, many of whom are here tody, and with those who are concerned about the fire service, both professionally and in local government, it became clear that there was a feeling that the Government's proposals would create the worst of all worlds. There was an impression that the Government had not listened to local authorities or to the public, who have a high opinion of the service that they receive from their local fire brigades. People would be fearful of any change—that is normal—but they are especially fearful about the changes proposed under the two orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was felt that a wider consultation exercise might have resulted in a set of proposals more acceptable to all those who are worried about the future of fire authorities in Wales. Given the fairly drastic local government reorganisation in the Principality, I accept that some changes are necessary. We could not expect everything to remain the same because of the changes in the structure of local government. However, had a more in-depth consultation process been carried out a better result might have been achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A seductive argument for a Greater Gwent fire authority has been put forcibly—and no doubt it will be put forcibly again today by some of my hon. Friends. There are some problems with the order as those who are currently covered by the Mid-Glamorgan authority might feel that the proposal is an encroachment into their area. Equally, they might consider that it would not serve those parts of the Mid-Glamorgan authority area that would be encompassed by the new Greater Gwent authority. I accept that controversy can be fuelled by some of the counter proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am about to say is really more a question than a positive suggestion, namely, that to consider making the fire authorities coterminous with police authorities has a certain logic. Both emergency services perform similar functions in terms of strategic
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
support and necessary communications. Indeed, on occasions fire authorities and police authorities work closely together, for example, when servicing industrial emergencies or major road or rail accidents. Such strategic arguments should have been addressed more fully and I should have liked the opportunity to have rehearsed them before we reached this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that problems might arise for north Wales and Dyfed-Powys if we made the police authorities coterminous with the fire authorities. I know from the time that I worked in Wales in the early 1980	<div class='sub'>s</div> <!-- sub --> that considerable areas must be covered. Anyone who has driven regularly in those areas will know about the transport problems when trying to link up the centres. Those problems must be considered properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by asking the Minister whether any commonly used equipment could go to the new authorities. That has a direct bearing on our acceptance of the orders. For example, not all authorities use the same breathing equipment apparatus, so under the new arrangements those fire officers expected to use breathing apparatus from other authorities will need additional training. Not all fire engines are the same, so further training may be required. The same would apply to aerial appliances and much other equipment in common and general usage. Different types of equipment are used by the various authorities, so the new authorities will have to train officers in their use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether an assessment has been made of the cost of retraining and of new maintenance programmes that may be needed for such equipment. We recognise that it is not a straightforward problem. We recognise, too, that something had to change in the fire services because of the changes in local government. However, the Government missed an opportunity to consult more widely and to regulate with greater consent. It is my intention—although I could be persuaded otherwise by a cogent argument—to oppose the orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.37 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Tom Sackville)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The combining of fire brigades has been widely discussed during the past three years. There has been some controversy, but there has also been consultation and a great deal of discussion between Ministers, professionals and local politicians. As hon. Members know, the order is now in force, but it is incumbent on me to do what I can to reassure those hon. Members who are unhappy with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that the examination of the most suitable brigade structure for Wales started in 1992. Shortly after that, as the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) said, local authority reorganisation was discussed. The 1993 White Paper on the Government's proposals for the future of local government, including fire services, came down strongly in favour of a three-brigade structure. There was a clear perception that it would be a better and more efficient way of providing fire services in Wales. That was based on the clear advice of, among others,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
the Chief and Assistant Chief Fire Officers Association and the Institution of Fire Engineers. It is important to stress that that advice remained unchanged throughout that entire period and I know of no resiling from it. Indeed, the advice was confirmed in a speech in Harrogate at "Fire 95" by the president of CACFOA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that with any reorganisation of fire services the most important criterion for assessing any proposed scheme is efficiency—in other words, whether the people in a particular locality are likely to receive the most efficient service? That means the speed at which they would expect a response to a 999 call. Can he assure me that the professional advice to which he referred—we must all rely on professional advice in circumstances such as this—was that the proposed scheme would be the most efficient scheme for Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. That is based on the concept that fire services must be provided in a way that does not involve an excessive overhead for each service. The optimum size for a brigade involves consideration of a great many variables, such as geography and local identity. There is a wide variation in the size of brigades across the United Kingdom, from those serving a population of 6·8 million in London to the smallest brigade in the Isle of Wight, which serves 117,000. Most of the old fire brigades in Wales were at the lower end of the scale, serving populations of 200,000 to 500,000. Efficiency can be achieved with a brigade of any size, but it was clearly the judgment of the professionals that larger brigades would be more efficient and involve less overhead, making more resources available for fighting fires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Alyn and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. My constituency is in north-east Wales, where there is some unease about the proposed order. I want to tell the Minister of the anxieties of the excellent and able firemen at Queensferry and Buckley. They are anxious that the amalgamation should be successful, but they are not sure that that will be the case. Will the Minister deal with that point? Does he, like me, believe that the firemen of Buckley and Queensferry are doing a remarkably good job?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it was remiss of me not to pay tribute to all the firefighters in Wales and throughout the United Kingdom. I intended to do so at the conclusion of my remarks, but I will bring forward that tribute and reiterate it. We are all lost in admiration for the splendid job done by fire services, both full-time and retained. The hon. Gentleman's constitutents would no doubt agree with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I need to be convinced that the amalgamation will be successful. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones), I am not persuaded, on balance, that the Gwynedd force and the Clwyd force should be amalgamated. The Minister has called in aid the chief fire officers' opinion to justify the measure, but was any other opinion sought? He went on to speak about officers,
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
but so far he has quoted only the chief officers. I am open minded on the matter, but I need convincing by more than the opinion of chief fire officers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The chiefs, assistant chiefs and the Institution of Fire Engineers were consulted. The matter has also been widely discussed in the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council for England and Wales, which is the main expert committee that advises the Home Secretary. It is made up of representatives of a series of organisations, including employers organisations and trade unions. I am aware that the proposal has its opponents, but it commands strong and consistent professional support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Scott 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chelsea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend the Minister say to what extent the boundaries of the fire brigade provision are coterminous with those of the police, civil defence and other emergency services in Wales? Do overlappings or inefficiencies arise from a lack of co-ordination between the services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has already been said that there are advantages to coterminosity. When there were eight brigades and four police forces in Wales, there was no coterminosity. There will be coterminosity in some parts of the structure, but not in others. The situation has not changed radically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have long experience of merging health authorities and ambulance services in England. We always took coterminosity as one factor, but we did not treat it as an absolute, as it cannot always be achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I offer the Minister a word of advice? If he is seeking to persuade Opposition Committee members, he should not pray in aid his experiences with the health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, I am proud of the fact that, during my time at the English Department of Health, the number of health authorities was reduced from 192 to just over 100. That was done for reasons similar to those advanced for the present change. There is a limit to how much one wants to spend on overheads, individual training or administrative facilities, as that money always comes from what is available to deliver the service, be it an ambulance, fire-fighting or civil defence service. There is a strong analogy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making an interesting point. Will he tell us what the estimated savings are for the new structures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The three new chief fire officers have just got behind their desks and are, for obvious reasons, not yet comitting themselves, but if there are three, rather than eight, administrative structures, there will, over time, be savings. There may also be considerable advantages if, for example, there is a larger training department than there was for a succession of smaller brigades.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one can commit themselves to a figure now, but it is common sense to say that if there is a suitable figure for each brigade and there are fewer brigades, there are likely to be fewer administrative overheads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply is astounding. During reorganisation of local government in Wales, the Welsh Office—and I may have disputed its figures—said that reorganisation would result in specific savings. Is the Minister saying that the current proposal is a leap in the dark and that he has not costed savings? I have not seen any figures in the documents that I have read, but I should have thought that the Minister would have had someone beavering away behind the scenes so that he could have told us today that the proposals would result in savings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I cannot come up with any figures that the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) could then dispute, but it would be unwise to make any estimates. If three administrative structures and three managements can deliver fire services as well as eight can, there will be savings—that is common sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister does not seem to be aware that some of the new fire authorities have produced indicative budgets for April next year. The one of the three that is not the subject of today's debate told me that the indicative budget for 1996-97 represents an 11.2 per cent. increase on the aggregate budget that they all spent in this financial year. That is without any growth in the service and will merely replace the central administration and so on that they were paying. In other words, in the first year it will cost a great deal more to provide the same level of service with three authorities than with the current eight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman that transitional moneys have been provided. Obviously any claims in the first instance will cost money, but we are aiming for long-term reform and administrative reorganisation. I have no doubt that when decisions are taken by the three new chief fire officers—they cannot be taken instantly—there will be opportunities for savings. That is not the only reason for the change, but it is an important one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister's assessment is wrong and there are additional costs in the short and long term, will the Government fully reimburse local authorities for those costs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give that assurance. If there are eight control offices and theoretically it is possible to reduce that to three in time, there will be savings on the central costs and overheads that will then be available for the front line of fire fighting. That will be obvious to everyone outside the Committee Room, so I am surprised that it is not obvious to the hon. Member for Newport, West.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Touhig 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islwyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister moves on, I want to return to the issue of consultation. Is he aware of a letter that I have received from his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary at the Welsh Office, telling me that the proposal for three brigades is a result of consultation on the White Paper and came from the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council for England and Wales. No other source is mentioned in the letter.
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Is the Minister also aware that the working group set up by the Welsh Office recommended four brigades, not three, and that that was passed on to the Home Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The professional advice has been consistent throughout that services would be best provided by three authorities. I have named the various bodies that gave that advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to refer to consultation, which has been extensive—both formal and informal—over some time. In particular, there has been detailed consultation with the existing fire authorities and the newly elected principal councils. My noble Friend Baroness Blatch, the Minister of State, Home Office, met representatives of Welsh local authorities last summer and listened very carefully to their concerns. She assured them that there was absolutely no question of the level of fire cover being diminished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I want to continue with my remarks on consultation a little longer. My noble Friend assured the authorities that the siting of fire stations, the deployment of fire fighters and all operational matters would continue to be governed principally by nationally accepted standards. She also said that she would consider alternative proposals. Indeed, alternative combination schemes were suggested, such as the one already referred to including Newport, Torfaen, Blaenau Gwent, Monmouthshire and Caerphilly. She carefully considered all those ideas, but found no grounds, on which to change the view that the best way to deliver fire services in Wales was to have three fire brigades. In my noble Friend's opinion, nothing emerged during the consultation process to contradict the professional advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer again to the letter that I received in July from a Minister at the Welsh Office, advising me that the Home Secretary would consult existing local authorities and the new unitary authorities only on three draft combination schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the basis of the consultation. It does not contradict what I have said, that my noble Friend had considered alternative proposals. The question of whether consultation occurred was tested in court. As the Committee will know, there was a judicial review because local authorities believed that that consultation had not been properly undertaken. The High Court decided that consultation had been undertaken. It is not for me or any Member to attempt to contradict Judge May.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister keeps informing us that the Government based their conclusions on professional advice. Does he consider the advice of the Fire Brigades Union to be professional? What response did he receive from that union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of the attitude of the Fire Brigades Union attitude and its opposition to the proposal. In our opinion, nothing that was said
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
contradicted the overall view that the optimum arrangement would be to have three fire brigades. As a result, the draft combination schemes were laid before the House on 24 October and, when the 40-day period under the negative resolution procedure expired on 8 December, orders were made on 10 December, which came into force on 11 December. So the shadow authorities responsible for making new arrangements are now working, with the able assistance of Her Majesty's inspectorate of fire services. I have absolute confidence that they will further develop the high level of skill and professionalism that has always been associated with fire services in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.57 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make one or two points. I emphasise the fact that all eight existing brigades performed well on the Audit Commission's criteria and that six of the eight were above average for the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council for England and Wales, that the Minister mentioned, requested a further review of the proposals for Wales, but the Government turned down that request without giving any reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, there have been no criticisms in the annual reviews of the eight brigades. So, while some change was necessary in the context of local government reform, the case has not been made for a huge change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interestingly, the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 altered the nature of procedures for change. Before that Act, a public inquiry would have been needed to bring about such a change; it is now carried out in consultations with councils. However, they did not have the opportunity, as the Minister claimed, for full consultation on the shape of the fire service in Wales. As Baroness Blatch told the councils, consultation would be limited and focused on practical matters relating to the brigade option. In Scotland and England, where there have been major structural changes to local government, there have been no changes to fire brigades. Why is that so?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) said, the Welsh Office proposed four brigades. The evidence that the Minister prayed in aid from the Chief and Assistant Chief Fire Officers Association, which he claimed supported three authorities, began by saying that the association would have liked to have kept eight. It recognised that there was a need for change because of local government reorganisation; it said that three or four would be a viable option; it supported four, but there is no analysis—I have the evidence here—of why three would be better than four. There are no facts or figures on the implications of different structures would; the association offers just its considered opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other organisation that the Minister has prayed in aid is the Institution of Fire Engineers. Many other people who are involved in providing fire services are totally opposed to the change. If the Minister is to proceed, he will do so, on the thinnest
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
grounds. He has already told us that he has no idea what savings there will be; he has told us only that if we move from eight to three authorities there are bound to be savings. But there are not bound to be savings. If the three authorities decided on extra structures in their hierarchy, they could end up costing more. It will depend upon the decisions of the brigades whether there are substantial savings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said, "If the Minister is to proceed", but I heard the Minister say that the chief fire officers are already in post. That is typical of the way in which the House scrutinises legislation; it is absolutely awful. Unless my hon. Friend has some good ideas, the water has flowed under the bridge and there is nothing that we can do. That is typical of the way in which Government goes about legislating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's intervention brings me to an interesting technical point that I wanted to raise about the two orders. On page 2 of the South Wales order, it says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The first chief officer of the fire brigade shall be N. Musselwhite Esq."</p></blockquote>
and on page 3 of the North Wales order, it says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The first chief officer of the fire brigade shall be A. V. Jones Esq."</p></blockquote>
As far as I know, the first chief officer of the South Wales brigade is the former chief of the Mid Glamorgan fire service, Mr. Williams. Can the Minister tell us why those two people were mentioned? Is there a technicality in the order, or are the orders now flawed because the wrong people have been mentioned? Should we, therefore, reject the orders and recall the Committee later?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard nothing today to convince us that three authorities are necessarily better than four, five, six, seven or eight. Until we hear better arguments, we shall certainly oppose the orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.2 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is rather strange that the order mentions the first chief officer by name. Why does it mention the first chief officer and not the second and third? I find that strange, and I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to answer that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more general point, there is a difficult balance to be struck between the obvious need to have local fire operations on the one hand and, on the other hand, the need to minimise overheads, that which I should have thought that no Member would challenge. The Opposition are always talking about the need to put money into front-line services and cut the cost of management and administration. It is self-evident that if we have three chief fire officers rather than eight, we shall make a considerable saving, because they are the highest paid people, and we shall have fewer of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In logic, the hon. Gentleman is perfectly right. One would expect that by reducing the number of fire authorities, one would obtain economies of scale in overheads. But all of the experience of local government reorganisation shows that often the opposite happens. The cost of transition,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
which often continues for four of five years, completely erodes the savings. I was involved in unreformed local government before 1974 and was a councillor in reformed local government after 1974, and it was perfectly plain that no savings whatsoever were made. Several of my hon. Friends have made that point, and I suspect that any savings eventually accrued will occur a long way in the future, by which time it will be impossible to compare like with like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need to distinguish between transitional costs—I accept that any reorganisation incurs extra transitional costs—and the on-going revenue costs, in which common sense suggests that a saving will be made, because there will be a streamlined operation. If that were the only consideration for providing an efficient fire service in Wales, a case could be made for there being only one fire authority but that would not be desirable for the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know a great deal about Wales, but I know sufficient to say that the north of Wales is a long way from the south and that communications between the two are not good. It therefore makes sense to have one authority for the north, one for the middle and one for the south. That seems a sensible outcome. Had coterminosity been the most important criterion, the number of fire authorities would have been coterminous with the new local authorities—that is four in number. I can see the advantages of that. However, the argument in favour of coterminosity is often overstated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coterminosity is neat and tidy, but each case should be considered on its merits. I hope that it is not out of order, Mr. Hughes, to mention what happens in Buckinghamshire. The county has its own fire service, but the police service is provided by three countries—Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire—that are covered by the Thames Valley police authority. It is not suggested that the police force should be reduced or that the fire service should be increased. Both work perfectly well without coterminosity. If, as my hon. Friend said, the smallest authority in England and Wales is on the Isle of Wight, serving some 100,000 people, and the largest authority in Greater London serves more than 6 million people, we could ask the cost per head of providing that service. That would be one way of discovering whether good value for money was provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider whether the taxpayer gets good value for money and enjoys the economy, efficiency and effectiveness that might reasonably be expected from a fire service. From what I have heard today, the order is entirely sensible. I hope that it will be supported by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martyn Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it astonishing that there are no Welsh Members of Parliament on the Government Benches, yet the orders are exclusively Welsh. Notwithstanding that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) knows that the north and south of Wales are a long way apart—I am
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
impressed with that—there are certain geographical and language difficulties. I know north Wales reasonably well and, like my hon. Friends, I know that Clwyd and Gwynedd are separate and distinct areas. English Members probably do not understand the problems in those areas, where many Welsh place names sound identical and are spelt the same, but can be as much as 150 miles apart. That could cause considerable problems to the new authority. Geography is also a problem; in north Wales there are things called mountains, which tend to get in the way of the things called roads. Local knowledge is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Gwynedd people know Gwynedd well and Clwyd people know Clwyd well. Amalgamating the two authorities will create tremendous problems, involving not only geography and language but also administration, because until now each area has had a different ethos. I agree that the proposal will create an authority coterminous with the North Wales police authority, but the police authority has had a long time to get over the problem and has done so very well. There are many more divisional and sub-divisional police stations scattered throughout the area than there are fire stations, yet the police still need a helicopter to travel around. There is a potential for problems, which consultation with the Fire Brigades Union should have highlighted. I am not sure that the chief fire officers fully have the ability to advise the Government on the best way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is odd that no Welsh Conservative Member decided to serve on this Committee. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham said, it is a criticism of how the Government carry out the business of the House, often treating the House with contempt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reorganisation is going ahead, but I—like many hon. Members and people outside the House—have my doubts about it. I hope that it will not result in any disasters. Saving costs is all very well, but I am concerned about saving human lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.11 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make some points about the Mid and West Wales fire authority, which will be created under the combination order. There will be an impact on more than half the surface of Wales—that is, the area that the authority will cover. I speak as someone who, from 1981 to 1993, was a member of the Dyfed county council public protection committee, which was responsible for overseeing the work of Dyfed fire brigade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put on record the effect the changes will have on mid and west Wales. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South-West (Mr. Jones) mentioned the size of the area covered by the North Wales fire authority, but it is not as large as that covered by the Mid and West Wales fire authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spent some time before this Committee sitting looking at maps in the Library. The distance between the far south west—St. Ann's Head—and the far north east—Welshpool is the largest town there—of the area covered by the proposed authority is the same as that between Bristol and Greenwich, Westminster and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Nottingham, or Westminster and Wolverhampton. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield may well say that his police authority takes in the whole of the Thames valley, but I wonder whether he would like to have a fire or police authority that stretched from Bristol to Westminster. Indeed, it would probably pass close to his constituency. I am sure that he would find that unacceptable in terms of accountability. I am sure that it would not be efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been said, we have lived through one reorganisation of local government in Wales, we must now live through another. Before the 1974 reorganisation, we were told by Ministers that big was beautiful. We were told that combining local authorities such as Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire, Meirionnydd and Monmouthshire, for example, and creating Dyfed, Powys and Gwynedd, would produce efficiencies, but the efficiencies did not come. We had to have new legislation to create local authorities to look after our education, social and fire services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept what the Minister says, especially as evidence from the budgets of the three new authorities shows that each will have to spend more than 10 per cent. on new infrastructure. Those costs will not be one-off; they will be on-going. The authorities have had the benefit of using the central administration system of existing county councils, such as their legal services and treasurers, but now they will have to start paying for them or set up their own. That is why there is a significant increase in their running costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that there will be an overall reduction in the number of chief fire officers, but the bulk of the administration work of fire brigades is done in the divisions, not at central headquarters. We will find, especially in respect of the three new authorities, that more people will have to be located at headquarters to look after a huge area. That is why the budgets are increasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dyfed fire brigade has an excellent record. It is world renowned for the fires that it has fought on the Milford Haven waterway, as is the West Glamorgan fire brigade in respect of the petrochemical and steel industry complexes in that area. I fear that that excellence might be diluted between two competing authorities, with local pressure being put on the need for more fire brigades in urban areas. Pressure on rural areas will be manifest. Rural fire brigades are already totally dependent on a retained service and it is becoming more difficult to recruit. The three large authorities might find great difficulties in recruiting a sufficient number of retained men and women to service the rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing a public service, so it should be fully accountable to those whom it serves. For people serving on the fire authority, it will be the equivalent of people from Bristol or Wolverhampton deciding on issues relevant to Westminster. There is no way in which the fire authority can be properly accountable—not through any fault of its members, but because it does not know the area. That is the problem and one of the reasons why the administration burden will escalate. Chief officers will have to travel over huge areas, trying to keep members of the authority
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
informed. Goodness knows what their mileage costs will be—probably horrendous. In a year or two a chief fire officer will put in an application for a helicopter; I am prepared to put money on that. It will be argued that that would be cheaper than using a car. It will certainly be a damned sight quicker. To travel from the south west to the north east in good driving conditions would take at least four hours. In bad driving conditions in winter, it could take six hours at the least.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, "Or never". Major problems have not been dealt with by the Minister; I hope that he will now deal with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.18 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to associate myself with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger). The Conservative Benches are filled with people who are not from Wales. It cannot really matter to them whether we have three, four or five authorities in Wales. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield admitted that he did not know much about Wales, but he listened to his hon. Friend the Minister for 10 minutes and thought that that was good enough. That is how these matters progress in the House of Commons. It is not good enough because, at the end of the day, what happens cannot honestly matter to the hon. Gentleman, provided that we in Wales organise ourselves reasonably efficiently, taking into account all the criteria, including the need to be efficient and not to be profligate. A good service must be provided, Why should it matter to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield how we do that? Clearly, it matters to the Government so much that they have packed the Conservative Benches with hon. Members from England and no one from Wales. They have not even included a Minister from the Welsh Office to sit next to the parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government tell us that there will be three fire authorities and we can do nothing about that as Conservative Members are sitting hear waiting to outvote us in the votes that will follow the debate. The people of Wales and their elected representatives will not have had a say in the matter. We can speak here, but it will do us no good in the final vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Does he recall, too, that although there were Welsh Office Ministers on that Committee, they did not seem to understand our arguments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do recall those days. We spent many long hours debating that Act, but we did not get our way in the end. There were one or two rebellions by individual Conservative Members, but the Government used their majority on the Floor of the House on Report to ensure that any rebellion in Committee was well and truly reversed.

	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
We are in the same position again, but what can we do about it? Unfortunately, we can do nothing, but the next Government, which will be a Labour one, will do something. One of the principal reasons why something will be done is that there will be a Welsh Parliament to ensure that what is happening this afternoon will never happen again. If there was ever a doubt that there should be a Welsh Parliament, it has been dispelled by what is happening in the Committee this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman believe that this is a matter for which a Welsh Parliament would have responsibility? Will it be responsible for the expenditure and, if so, how will it raise the money to pay for the fire service in Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not dwell on that, but suffice to say that expenditure for fire authorities comes, by and large, from the people who live in the area. Such expenditure might come via Westminster or from local taxation, but by and large, the services that we are considering this afternoon are paid for by the people who live in the area. That is a canard, if I may say so, Mr. Hughes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In north Wales, the distance from the eastern parts of the English Maelor to Bardsey island is 100 miles. It would not necessarily take six hours to travel from one end to the other, but it would certainly take two or three hours. We have a better east-west road; it is a smaller area, but it is wide and would probably be about the same distance as that from Westminster to Bristol. If the matter had been left for us in Wales to decide, we would probably have had not just two fire authorities in south Wales, but three, and Gwent may have had its own. That would have been extremely sensible—for a start, is dictated by the geography and how the valleys run. We would probably have had an extra fire authority in north Wales—a Clwyd one, based on Clwyd county council, and another one based on Gwynedd county council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The geography dictates that. But there is not just a geographical barrier with the hills of Snowdonia; there is a cultural barrier because far more Welsh is spoken on the west side than on the east side of north Wales. We would probably have come round to saying that it might cost a little extra in administration, although if my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger) is right, it could easily cost less because of the way in which the work is driven and carried out in any fire authority. I take his advice on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would have said that, whatever the circumstances, in the interests of quality of service, we should have had two fire authorities in north Wales. The authority in Clwyd would probably know any place in Clwyd. Equally, if Gwynedd had its own fire authority, its members would know the parts of Gwynedd under its remit. I know north Wales reasonably well, but if I were a member of that authority living in Wrexham and were asked to consider a matter in Blaenau Ffestiniog or Portmadoc,
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
my knowledge would not be very good. I would be extremely reticent in deciding detailed matters so far away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go on at length. There is no point, as we shall be outvoted. After the next general election, that will change. Never again will we see lines of English Members and English faces on the Government Benches, telling us what we in Wales must do because they insist on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is significant that, as we speak, a sign above us on the monitor indicates the decline of the Conservative party. The splendid, conscience-driven former Conservative Member for Torridge and West Devon (Miss Nicholson) is speaking in the Chamber. That shows what is happening to this crumbling Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all grateful to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) for Exoceting the Minister's main argument by pointing out that his pious, naive point is that big is beautiful, and that the bigger anything gets, the greater the savings. As the hon. Gentleman remarked, why are the Government stopping at the present proposal? Why do they not propose a single force for the whole of Wales, or the United Kingdom, or Europe? It would be absurd, but that is what the Minister said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister once aspired to represent a Gwent constitutency. People still speak with wonder of the days when the aristocratic young candidate called at the doors of miners' cottages. The culture clash was legend in Wales. On one memorable occasion, the young candidate was confronted with a miner dressed in his vest, having come off the morning shift, with braces dangling and a Woodbine in the corner of his mouth. The candidate was perplexed and tried to make sense of the situation. Looking the gentleman up and down, he said, "I'm so sorry to interrupt you while your are dressing for dininer." That illustrates the culture clash between the Conservatives and Wales. It is nothing to do with Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned consultation. The Government have carried out consultation, but they take no notice of what anyone says. I expected to hear the results of that consultation. In addition to a few self-interested professional bodies, there has been a mass consultation in Gwent, carried out by the 	<i>South Wales Argus</i> and other groups in the county. The voice of Gwent overwhelmingly wants not the Government option, but the Gwent or greater Gwent option. The reason was that given by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On each of the published tables for efficiency of call-out, Gwent is not just a good force—it is the best in the United Kingdom. The preposterous proposal is that if that winning team is changed, all the teams become the best in the United Kingdom. That is not sensible. Operations work on a certain scale and we know that the Gwent force has achieved levels of efficiency higher than those achieved anywhere else. The county has spoken with one voice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elected representatives were mentioned. I believe that there are some Conservative representatives in Gwent and other parts of Wales. There are not many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
and there is not a single Conservative representative in my constituency. The Conservative party achieved the enormous sum of 4 per cent. support in the local elections. It did not quite reach that level in the by-election won by my hon. Friend for Islwyn (Mr Touhig). As my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham said, Wales is being treated as a colony. The Conservative party gets about the same number of votes as the yogic flyers and the monster raving loony candidate-2 or 3 per cent. of the vote. That is the extent of its democratic legitimacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Gwent came out in large numbers to vote against the Government and in favour not of the organisation that has been imposed upon them, but a very different one. They believe in their local fire service, as they believe in their local police force. The police force has the remarkable record of coming top in the whole of the United Kingdom in all measures of attainment and efficiency. Sensibly, the Government changed their mind about the police, so I cannot understand why on earth they have not listened to the voice of local people who have said in enormous numbers, "We want to keep our Gwent force as it is; we want the levels of efficiency that it has achieved to continue". They do not want a reorganisation that will almost certainly lead to a decline in standards and to extra costs for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a disgrace that the Minister has espoused the pious view that there will be a decline in costs, but he has made no promise that the Government will foot the bill if costs increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. May I attempt to assist the Minister from my lofty vantage point as the honorary fire chief of the county brigade of Clwyd? I estimate that there are about 111 "pantres" in the combined counties of Gwynedd and Clwyd. It would help to dispel the scepticism among Opposition Members if the Minister were able to repeat the reasons why he believes that Gwynedd and Clwyd should be joined together. If he were to do that clearly, it might assist the remainder of our sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.32 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak, but the Minister's responses to interventions that I and other hon. Members made on the issue of consultation were so thin as to merit further comment. The order misses a great opportunity for greater Gwent to ensure that two of the three key services—police and fire—cover the same area of the old county, plus Caerphilly. The new unitary councils set up by the former Secretary of State for Wales were so concerned about the proposals for fire service reorganisation that they made representations to the Secretary of State and, when they felt that they were getting nowhere, went so far as to take the matter to the High Court. Led by Newport county borough, and supported by other authorities in Gwent and across Wales, they went to the High Court to complain that the consultation that the Government claimed to have held with local authorities about the reorganisation of the fire service
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
was not meaningful or of the extent required by the 1994 Act. The case was defeated because the Home Office declared that it had not made up its mind prior to consultation.

I refer again to a letter that I received from the Under-Secretary on 15 August, in which he states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I understand Mr. Howard is now consulting both the existing county councils and the new unitary authorities on three draft combination schemes for Wales."</p></blockquote>
That seems to fly in the face of the Home Office's declaration to the High Court that it had not decided on the structure before the orders were published.

I shall not take up much more of the Committee's time, other than to reiterate the frustration expressed by other members of the Committee—that the Government are simply not prepared to listen. All the people working at the coal face, so to speak, in the fire service in Gwent and across Wales have advised the Government against the action that they have taken. When will they listen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.35 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a courtesy to the Committee, I want to respond to one or two of the points that have been raised. On the question of size and numbers, I would not say that big is beautiful. The South Wales fire brigade will not be one of the biggest brigades in the country—in fact, it will be the 11 th largest. The other two proposed brigades will be the 25th and 34th largest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Several hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not take any interventions because every member of the Committee has had a chance to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all a matter of finding a balance, and the professional opinion is clear—the correct balance has been struck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A technical point was raised about the name of the chief officer mentioned in the orders. When the orders were issued, a chief officer had to be named, but no chief officer had been nominated for South Wales, so Her Majesty's inspector's name appeared instead. However, that in no way invalidates the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does it not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it certainly does not, but it was a good attempt by the hon. Member for Bridgend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various abstruse arguments have been put forward to suggest that the three brigades overheads will cost more than those of eight brigades. That is highly unlikely. The new chiefs would have to take eccentric decisions for that to be so. Because of the possibility of reducing the number of control rooms, training facilities and a series of other central facilities, substantial savings will be made which will be redeployed into fighting fires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wrexham lamented the fact that the orders had already come into force. The fact that the Labour party did not organise itself to debate them within 40 days is a matter for negotiation; certainly, it was not something that I chose.

I have listened carefully to the debate. I have heard nothing to persuade me that fire services will not be improved. They will be more effective and the long tradition of high-quality services will be maintained under the new structure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.38 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speak for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend wants me to speak for Wales. I am far better qualified to do so than the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My sense of passion—perhaps I should use the word "hwyl"—has grown throughout the debate. Without using some of the terms that my hon. Friends have used, I would say that it is sign of the times that the Government cannot field at least one Welsh Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sackville</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As of last Friday, there was no Welsh Labour Member on the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not that say much about how well prepared we were compared with the Government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has failed to prove his case. I came here with reservations, some ideas and a possible option that might have been better. I was prepared to listen. Frankly, the convincing case that I came to hear has not been made. We are asked to agree to orders that will result in no immediate savings. It will not be cheaper for the taxpayer. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield tried to make the case that it would be more efficient, but no arguments have been put about efficiency and no statistics have been given to show, for example, that response times will be improved. No savings will be made and efficiency is unlikely to be improved. As far as we know, there is no public support for the changes and no unanimity among local authorities. Indeed, the press in the Gwent area show not only that there is no public support for the proposals, but that, in that county at least, there is considerable opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the Minister cannot answer every question today, but my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South-West mentioned the difference between the spoken language that predominates in the county of Clwyd and that which predominates in the county of Gwynedd. I am a monoglot English speaker, but for a time I worked in Wales and thought that it might be politically correct to learn the Welsh language. Conservative Members are welcome to try that, as I did. I failed. The language is not easily transferrable.
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
Procedures that take place in the county of Gwynedd cannot easily be transferred to the county of Clwyd. Operational difficulties will occur, but we have not heard how such differences will be reconciled. They are not necessarily insurmountable, but we need to known how that will be achieved; we have heard nothing. To borrow a phrase from the law courts, the case is not proved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
