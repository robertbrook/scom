DRAFT CONTRACTING OUT (FUNCTIONS IN RELATION TO THE WELFARE FOOD SCHEME) ORDER 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. John Horam)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Contracting Out (Functions in Relation to the Welfare Food Scheme) Order 1996.</p></blockquote>
I must apologise to members of the Committee for dragging them away from the Chamber when my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health was about to make an important statement, preceded by an equally important subject—the fisheries policy. Members of the Committee will have spotted with their keen nose as parliamentarians—especially my hon. Friend the Member for South Hams (Mr. Steen) who is concerned about deregulation—that the point of the order is do away with a piece of administrative nonsense. The Committee is spending its time well in doing just that.<br><br>
The statutory instrument is made under the order-making power in section 69 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994—the all-embracing Act that allows us to remove procedures that are unnecessarily burdensome on industry and commerce.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Steen <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Hams)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to be discussing a statutory instrument when my hon. Friend the Minister is conducting our proceedings so admirably. Does he agree, however, that the administrative nonsense resulted from the Social Security Act 1988, which was introduced by the Conservative party?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sadly, that is so, but it is never too late to right a wrong, which is what we are doing today.<br><br>
The statutory instrument will improve procedures for reimbursing milk suppliers under the Department of Health's welfare food scheme by allowing the Department's contractor to undertake the whole reimbursement process. The welfare food scheme is complex. One of its main provisions is that families in receipt of income support receive a milk token each week for each child under five. That can be exchanged for seven pints of milk each week. That can be done with any milk retailer who chooses to take part in the scheme. Having accepted the token in payment for the milk supplied, the milkman or shop claims reimbursement for it by sending it to the welfare food reimbursement unit.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Until 1994, the token redemption was undertaken in Blackpool by civil servants who were employed by the Benefits Agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How many?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend must wait a moment. In 1993, the operation was market tested and the contract was awarded in 1994 to Nielsen's Clearing House Ltd. which has been successfully running the reimbursement operation on behalf of the Department of Health since then.<br><br>
The operation is efficient and uses modern technology. However, it has not been possible to gain full value for money from the contractor's services as the Social Security Act 1988—to which my hon. Friend the Member for South Hams referred and which was, indeed, passed by a Conservative Government—requires the Secretary of State for Health or his officials to carry out certain functions, including the approval of claims and authorisation of payments. The officials at the Department of Health have been required to duplicate effort by approving and authorising about 1,000 claims a day that had already been checked by the contractor. My hon. Friends will understand the procedure to which I am referring.<br><br>
The Order will enable Health Ministers to authorise the Department of Health's contractor, Nielsens's Clearing House, to carry out the reimbursement process. It will also allow us to authorise the contractor to ask for the necessary documentary evidence to support the claims. That will enable us to gain the maximum benefit from the contractor. It will speed up the reimbursement process and provide a more efficient service to milk suppliers. It will also avoid unnecessary work for Department of Health officials. I am unsure how many officials are employed on such work, but the order will certainly save the work of one person, and I suspect that it will save the work of even more people as time goes by.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Teresa Gorman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will that be one person per pint or one person per token?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is one person per year.<br><br>
I reassure the Committee that the order will not affect the benefit delivered or welfare food beneficiaries in any way. It involves a purely administrative saving. There will be no dilution of standards in the reimbursement of claims from milk suppliers. The contract between the Department of Health and Nielsen's Clearing House provides robust safeguards for the reimbursement process and for the public purse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister has said that income support is the trigger. Am I correct in saying that people who are receiving family credit cannot get milk, but they can get dried milk? For some reason, those on income support who have children under the age of five can get the fresh stuff, but those on family credit can get only the dried stuff. Can my hon. Friend explain whether the contracting-out
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0601">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
provision will deal with dried milk or whether civil servants will still deal with it, while the contractors will deal with fresh milk?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure my hon. Friend, off the cuff, that the order deals with the dried milk scheme, too, which is available in nurseries and schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed, it deals with that.<br><br>
The order is a simple provision, which will enable us to improve the efficiency of the administration of a major element of the welfare food scheme with no detriment to beneficiaries. As I have said, there has been a minor administrative nonsense—Department of Health officials have had to duplicate all the work. The order stops all that nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will excuse the fact that I am asking him so many questions, but it is matter of great interest and public importance that we get the milk to the right people, at the right time, in the right way and at the right price. I did some research, and I understand that we are talking about millions of gallons of milk and 50 million tokens a year. Each token is worth about seven pints of milk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nine pints.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If each token is worth about nine pints, we could be talking about as much as 450 million gallons of milk. I understand that, unfortunately, we are no longer self-sufficient in milk because of the European Union. Does the milk that our children drink come from France? Does the 20 per cent. of milk that comes from abroad go to our children?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is foreign milk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point. For the purposes of the scheme, would we be self-sufficient in milk?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to regret the fact that so many of my hon. Friends attended the Committee, but I shall answer the questions that my hon. Friend asked. As a result of the welfare milk scheme, approximately £180 million a year is disbursed on liquid milk. A further £48 million is disbursed on dried milk and vitamins. A further £40 million is spent on the nursery milk scheme in addition to the other two items. My hon. Friend is right: the scheme involves big money, and it is important to our dairy farmers. Off hand, I cannot tell him how much milk comes from abroad or from England. However, the bulk of it will come from England, which is of great benefit to our farmers.</span></p>
<p>4.39 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kevin Barron <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rother Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would have thought that Conservative Members would have been more concerned about why we have this welfare scheme at all. It is part of the welfare state. The reason families receive milk is so that children get the nutrition that they need. It is a state benefit. Hon. Members will know that during the past decade there has been a large increase in the number of people in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
this country living on or below the poverty level. It is most important that children in households that are living on or below the poverty line get this sustenance from the state. That is why the scheme is the responsibility of the Department of Health.<br><br>
This Committee is not the place to siphon off Europhobic feelings about European milk quotas or the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food's intentions in respect of our milk quotas. We are considering a public health matter and a scheme that looks after tens of thousands of young children who might not otherwise get the type of nutrition that they need to develop. It was not devised in 1988; it has been in existence since the welfare state into which I was born was set up, in the 1940s.<br><br>
I am grateful for the Minister's explanation. I know that the unit that effectively cashes the milk tokens was market tested several years ago. I think that the Minister gave us a reasonable explanation for that—it was because of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 which we consider an ideological Act. That clears up that matter.<br><br>
I also read the explanatory memorandum from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, which says that the Government intend to make new consolidation regulations very shortly. Those may materially affect the order. Will the Minister give us an undertaking closely to consider any such regulations?<br><br>
I made a search of the Library, and the last time we debated the welfare food scheme was in 1990, although a number of statutory instruments have since been passed without debate. In 1990, there was a debate on the Floor of the House followed by a Division. there was much debate about who would pay for the system. The Minister's predecessor, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the right hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Freeman) told the House:
<br><blockquote><p>"The independent deliveryman … should bear only an equitable part of the total discount"</p></blockquote>
—a discount that was forced on delivery men by the Government. The right hon. Gentleman continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"He should pass on the other part … either by getting his milk cheaper or by the processor … paying a premium on the redemption of the tokens … Unless there is evidence of … an equitable sharing of distribution of that … burden between the producer, the bottler and deliveryman—I give an undertaking that we will review the regulations."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 29th January 1990; Vol. 166, c. 128–9.]</p></blockquote>
Given that there are likely to be further changes in the regulations—judging by the memorandum, substantial changes—I hope that the Minister will talk to people who are concerned about how the system works.<br><br>
I spoke to the dairyman who delivers to my home, who is also a member of the trade association committee in my area. He said that what was promised 1990 did not occur. The money that the Government saved was borne solely by doorstep delivery people, not shared with milk producers and bottlers.<br><br>
If major changes to the regulations are proposed, will the Minister speak to organisations such as the National Dairymans Association, so that they can have a say in those changes? Will the Minister consider the promises made by his predecessor that he would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0602">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
ensure that the costs of the scheme are divided fairly between all those concened? My milkman and the association argue that that has not been the case.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is obviously important for Members of Parliament to question statutory instruments to satisfy themselves that these matters are properly debated. I am sure that anything that is connected with my hon. Friend the Minister is perfectly properly put together and that he has taken the best possible advice.<br><br>
I do wonder about this matter, however. First, we shall be saving only one member of staff at a cost of say, £15,000 or £20,000 a year. Why are we discussing another statutory instrument when we already have 2,300? Why are we adding yet another to the list for the sake of £20,000 a year? I cannot understand it.<br><br>
Secondly, I do not understand why we do not deregulate if that is what we want to do. Why not get rid of the whole scheme? Why do we need officials and registration forms? I have the forms in front of me. I thought that we in the Conservative party wanted to get rid of endless form filling. The milkman may be good at supplying milk, but he probably does not have to fill in all those forms—there are six of them. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister says that deregulation is at the heart of our party's policy, so why not get rid of such forms? We should abolish the scheme and give out a little ticket with pensions, benefits or income support offering a certain amount of money for milk. I cannot understand why the Committee has been put together by the House to save £20,000—or perhaps £30,000—for one civil servant, when we should be deregulating. My hon. Friend the Minister is known for his deregulation zeal and his experience of both large and small firms, and he is one of our best Minister on such issues. Has he been brainwashed by his officials into agreeing a scheme that will do nothing besides saving £20,000. Although that may be important, it not important enough.<br><br>
We are talking about very large sums of money and a great deal of milk. We need to find out whether the milk involved is imported and whether we need to ask the European Community to increase the amount of milk that we can produce in this country so that we can provide our own children aged under five with milk. Are we importing milk from France to give to our own children?<br><br>
Thirdly, will the Minister say whether there is any way of tracking the tokens? Are there officials going round checking that the tokens are used? Are they all used? Are all the tokens that are supplied returned? Would not it be easier to offer a token to someone and then forget about it? We would avoid the bureaucracy and forms that must cost tens, if not hundreds of thousands of pounds.<br><br>
Everyone wants to get milk to the children—there is no question about that. I am presuming that it is good for them, although there is some doubt about that.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Perhaps red wine would be better, but that is French. Surely we can find a system that is less bureaucratic, involves less form filling and is less expensive.<br><br>
I gather that we are rubber-stamping something that has already happened and that the matter has virtually been contracted out in any case. I am rather perplexed about why I am hear at all. [HON. MEMBERS: "So are we"] I know that I tend to make the same speech every time I attend Committees on deregulation orders. We should not have to have the order because we should not have all this bureaucracy. We should be getting rid of the whole scheme.</span></p>
<p>4.49 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Biffen <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on the courteous and explicit way in which he has introduced the topic, and he has my warmest sympathy. If the matter is pushed to a vote, he will certainly have my support. Although I have some sympathy for my hon. Friend the Member for South Hams, I cannot quite understand the magnitude of the problem that he has about our being here. My hon. Friend makes the same speech each time; I suspect most of us are guilty of that solecism, but we are still invited to be members of the Committee. There seems to be no escape.<br><br>
I was interested in the comment of the hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron). There is inevitably a sort of tour d'horizon when we debate the subject of welfare milk, including its history and social significance and what it does for improvident dairy farmers. We are now presented with what is clearly an important development in the relationship between the various parties to the scheme. My reaction was that although the measure is quite modest—I shall use French for the benefit of my hon. Friend the Member for South Hams, which I know will distress my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman)—"ne que le premier pas qui coup"; it would lead to something more significant. I would understand that. Is the decision before us ring-fenced and self-contained? If so, it is modestly significant and will not detain us. If my hon. Friend intends it to be considered in the wider context of further Government ambition, he would serve the Committee well—and I would appreciate it—if he could say little about it.</span></p>
<p>4.52 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Biffen) for his warm support for this modest measure. I say to him and to my hon. Friend the Member for South Hams that there is a wider context. We are clearing up an administrative consequence of a market-testing exercise. If we examine market testing in the round, it can be seen that the Government have already saved more than £500 million of taxpayers' money on market testing.<br><br>
We are dealing here with a contracting-out exercise. We must consider it in the context of reducing administrative burdens and improving the efficiency of Government operations. Therefore, my right hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire and my hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0603">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
Friend the Member for South Hams may think that our time has been well spent, although this little order cannot by itself bear the whole burden that they would put upon it.<br><br>
On the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for South Hams, I fully recognise that forms are a problem. I should like to think about the measure in the light of his remarks. I have not seen the forms that he mentioned. He has copies and no doubt he will let me see them when the Committee has finished.<br><br>
On the wider point about importing milk, as there is a free market—which no doubt my hon. Friend the Member for South Hams supports—milk may be bought wherever retailers wish to buy it, so I cannot comment. In the wider scheme of things, I take his point that this is a somewhat bureaucratic way of administering welfare benefit. The hon. Friend for Rother Valley said that it was a valuable thing to do, but that it was possible to find a less expensive way of achieving the same aim. I accept that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barron</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in what the hon. Member for South Hams said. As I understand it, if the system involved income support rather than tokens, it would be necessary to ascertain how many children were under five because, unusually, payment is made for children up to 11. The hon. Member for South Hams may have devised a scheme through which we could create many more jobs and employ a few thousand unemployed people by ending the tokens system and arranging provision through income support. Will the Minister examine the idea to see whether that could be done?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seem to remember the deputy leader of the Opposition advocating that the Government should soak up unemployed people—even if they were employed inefficiently—so as to reduce unemployment. The hon. Gentleman seems to be advancing that argument in a different form.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in saying that children under five years of age and pregnant women on income support receive those payments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, does it happen automatically?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If those tokens are given automatically, and if they are equivalent to cash for milk, all those bureaucrats and forms are unnecessary. The tokens are equal to cash. I do not understand the need for that bureaucracy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely understand my hon. Friend's argument; what he suggests would result in a significant saving in the administration of the scheme. Obviously, I am entirely in favour of that general principle. An important change to the scheme's administration would be needed—a simplification—but that is outside the Committee's remit. My hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Friend will have to take that up in a different forum—perhaps the all-party deregulation committee, which might provide more grist to his mill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to join in the general congratulations being given to the Minister on his wonderful work and his great interest in the subject, but is not this an opportunity for him to do as my hon. Friend the Minister for South Hams said, and do away with that bureaucracy and form filling?<br><br>
Just for the record, and because the hon. Member for Rother Valley raised the subject, I can tell the Committee that I am old enough to remember buying a third of a pint of milk at school for one old penny. I imagine that the milk was distributed without having to pay any army of bureaucrats; the local milkman used to deliver it every morning and we all had a bottle of milk a day. We now have an army of bureaucrats. I do not know how much of that £180 million goes in wages rather than in putting milk down children's throats, but I imagine that it is quite a lot. And what have we got? Milk costs probably three times as much now than it did then because of a complicated means-tested scheme. Such schemes always results in more bureaucracy, with lots of form filling. The Minister could make his reputation by being the first to make a pile of those forms and set light to it. We should all celebrate that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is, indeed, an attractive prospect; it is a wonderful idea. Sadly, this small statutory instrument will not bear the burden of all those expectations, otherwise I should be first in the queue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barron</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Members for South Hams and for Billericay are saying is very interesting. However, the forms are completed by the people who deliver the milk, not by an army of civil servants. The dairy industry has to use that mechanism to be repaid for delivering that milk. The Minister might bum those forms, but he will have to give to someone else the job now being done by those who deliver the milk.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A further attraction of the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay is that, given the Committee's composition, we could indeed run riot on some of those issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister could do a great service to the cause of deregulation by withdrawing the draft order. He should say that it will not do, and that whether public or private, an army of officials administering those wretched tokens would still use public funds. He needs only to provide a stamp to people who have children under five years of age or who are pregnant; it would be equivalent to money, but could be exchanged only for milk. The stamp could even be used in shops. We do not need to contract out that scheme.<br><br>
We could, instead, increase income support by the price of a pint of milk. Some parents may not want to give milk to their children; they may want to give them Lucozade or ice cream—which may be just as good for them. The Minister has the opportunity now to withdraw the statutory instrument. He should

understand that Conservative Back-Bench Members are concerned that the Government should follow the principle and leadership of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister in wanting fewer rules and regulations. All we are gaining today is the salary of one member of staff; I suggest that we take the scheme away. The Minister would earn brownie points for doing so from Conservative members of the Committee and from the Prime Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sadly, I cannot agree with my hon. Friend. We must press ahead with the statutory instrument, small and tiny though it be. If my hon. Friend raises the matter himself in the appropriate place, the greater glory will be his.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the appropriate place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Horam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the statutory instrument cannot take account of larger questions. If my hon. Friend raises the matter in the appropriate place, I am sure that he will receive considerable support for his views. I encourage him to do that. He will gain the glory, not me, which I am sad about, but I do not deny him the glory.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
Finally, to the hon. Member for Rother Valley I say that we have considered the instruments in light of the consolidated regulations that are being introduced. That is why we have taken some time to introduce the statutory instrument. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we are in discussion with the National Dairymen's Association about the matters that he raised.</span></p>
