	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Michael Ancram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Education (Northern Ireland) Order 1995.</p></blockquote>
The order was laid before the House on 21 November and the largest single element of the order consists of the provisions in part II relating to special education, which reflect those already introduced in England and Wales by the Education Act 1993. The provisions are intended to make the education system in Northern Ireland even move responsive than it is now to the wishes of parents of children with special educational needs. They have been the subject of extensive public consultation, both in their own right and as part of the consultation on the draft order, and I believe that they command widespread support. I have also given a commitment that my Department will hold further full consultation in due course on the detail of the main subordinate measures that will be required to give full effect to the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly describe the main features of the draft order relating to special education. Part II of the order consolidates both new and existing special education legislation. Among the existing provisions, I emphasise in particular that the duty remains to integrate statemented pupils with their peers in mainstream schools, as long as to do so is consistent with parental wishes, with the needs of all the children involved and with the efficient use of resources. Under articles 4 and 5, a code of practice for identifying and assessing special educational needs will be drawn up and issued by my Department, again following full consultation. The code will establish workable guidelines for schools, education and library boards and others for the identification of children with special needs and the procedures following from this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents' rights of appeal against decisions by education and library boards will be greatly extended to include six additional circumstances in which parents may appeal: against proposed placements; against the description of children's special educational needs; against decisions by boards not to comply with parental requests for assessments and reassessments; and against decisions by boards in connection with the amendment or discontinuation of statements. The order provides that all such appeals will be to an independent special educational needs tribunal, established under a president, and with a legally qualified chairman sitting with two members
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
appointed from an independent lay panel maintained by the Department. Its decisions will be binding on all parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order also sets out a range of provisions aimed at securing improvements to existing practice in several areas. These include provisions to secure greater flexibility at key stage 4; to introduce new arrangements for approving the transfer of pupils to secondary school either a year early or a year late; to streamline procedures for the acquisition of grant maintained status; to enable lay persons to participate in inspections conducted by the Department of Education in Northern Ireland inspectorate; and to provide the trustees of voluntary schools that close with greater latitude in the disposal of their share of the proceeds of the school premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The approval and subsequent implementation of the draft order will lead to significant improvements in the education of Northern Ireland children and particularly those with special educational needs. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.34 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The briefness of the Minister's opening speech belies the significance of the order. Once again, the measures show the people of Northern Ireland the prize to be grasped if we can achieve a full political settlement because we should not deal with such significant measures in this way. If the proposals related to England, Wales or Scotland, they would be contained in a reasonably sized Bill and would be open to full negotiation and discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I intend to address the issue of special needs but I hope to address other aspects of the order. My comments on special educational needs fall into two parts. First, why have the Government set up this framework—in particular, its legalistic aspects—to deal with special educational needs? Secondly, what resources are to be devoted to special educational needs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have followed the English and Welsh pattern by setting up a special educational needs tribunal. Surprisingly, the Minister has forgotten his Scottish background and has not sought an alternative way of dealing with the matter. Sadly, he has remembered his legal background as a barrister and has set up a framework that rewards barristers. In Scotland, this aspect of special educational needs has not been put into a legal framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bringing the law into any issue has consequences. The procedure becomes lengthy and drawn out because the law never seems to deal with anything on time. A parallel tribunal, the special educational needs tribunal for England and Wales, which was set up in September last year, has had 700 appeals but has heard only 143 cases. Already a substantial backlog seems to have built up. A child only gets one chance at an education, and we should not be setting up a framework to deal with special educational needs that leads to long delays before appeals are heard and decided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
Is it necessary to set up a framework modelled on the court system so that a barrister has to be president or chairman or the tribunal? Is legal language the best medium? On page 14 of the order, article 15 states that a board,
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall serve a notice on the child's parent".</p></blockquote>
That is the language of legalism and criminality. Is that really the best way to deal with special educational needs? The framework is potentially intimidating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A legal framework also means that a panoply of case law will build up. Provision of legal advice will be requested so that parents do not feel intimated by the array of experts called in by the education and library boards. There is already a legal logjam in England and Wales, so we should be seeking an informal and speedier way of resolving disputes. Why has the Minister chosen to take the legalistic road?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no use setting up a framework unless it is properly resourced, which brings me to the second part of my speech. The framework will represent a step forward for children with special educational needs and their parents only if extra resources are given to schools and the education and library boards to enable them to carry forward the process. It is important for the Minister to say what resources are being allocated to cater for special educational needs. In a parliamentary answer on 23 May 1995, the Secretary of State for Education told my hon. Friend the Member for Woolwich (Mr. Austin-Walker):
	<br><blockquote><p>"the hon. Gentleman may not be aware that an Audit Commission survey in 1992 found that two thirds of head teachers did not know how much was in their budgets for special educational needs".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 May 1995; Vol. 260, c, 695.]</p></blockquote>
She was critical, in her special schoolmistress style, of head teachers who did not know their special educational needs budget. It should therefore be easy for the Minister to tell us the size of Northern Ireland's special educational needs budget and how much it has been increased by the measure that we are considering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, as well as clear identification of special needs funds, there should be proper auditing and accounting at the end of the financial year to ensure that the money set aside for special needs has been used to the advantage of such children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who has raised a crucial point. It should not be necessary to ring-fence the resources, but unless we ensure that they are going to the children intended, teachers, parents and children will feel shortchanged by the measure, which promises a great deal without providing the necessary funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers have many concerns. Will extra staff be provided to deal with the day-to-day administration of a school's special educational needs programme? Will there be scope for specialist staff to co-ordinate the programme in schools? Considerable documentation will be needed. The order places emphasis on statemented children, for whom there will be a formal system documenting their needs, enabling checks to be made on whether the programmes of schools and the education and library board are being carried out.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
However, the majority of children with special educational needs will not be statemented. The extra needs of those children will be recognised, but they will not have access to the formal system. A serious approach to special educational needs must take account of those children and provide resources for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a chronic shortage of educational psychologists throughout the United Kingdom. There is little point in schools identifying needs that have to be assessed unless there are resources to provide educational psychologists or occupational therapists from health boards to cater for those needs. What action will be taken to back up the order? Without such back-up, the order contains only hollow words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is particularly important because there is a prevalent suspicion elsewhere in the United Kingdom that general financial constraints have put the specialist personnel in education authorities under pressure to find cheap answers for those with special educational needs. For example, under-resourced solutions to help children with autism or dyslexia are frequently put forward because the equivalent of the education and library board does not want to spend too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to raise some specific points. I understand the wording of article 3(3) on page 6 which concerns children in Northern Ireland schools whose first language is not English and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A child is not to be taken as having a learning difficulty solely because the language (or form of the language) in which he is, or will be, taught is different from a language (or form of a language) which has at any time been spoken in his home."</p></blockquote>
I appreciate that we should not have a special needs ghetto, in that a teacher can decide that, because a child's first language is not English, that child can be categorised as having special educational needs and differentiated from other children solely for that reason. However, a child whose first language is not English will have particular difficulties in the education system. As the order excludes such children, what resources and skills are available in the Northern Ireland education system to cater for them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5(2) on page 7 gives a freedom to DENI. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Department shall consult such persons about the draft"—</p></blockquote>
that is the draft code, which will be one of the keys to the success of the order—
	<br><blockquote><p>"as the Department thinks fit and shall consider any representations made by them."</p></blockquote>
I plead with the Minister for parent groups to be included in the consultation with DENI and that there will be no question of consulting only professional groups. DENI must identify relevant parent groups and ensure that they are consulted. I should like the Minister to confirm that today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unhappy with article 7(2)(b)(iii) on page 8 which requires that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the efficient use of resources."</p></blockquote>
are borne in mind when complying with the duty to secure education in their ordinary school for children for whom the board maintains a statement of special educational needs. That is the wrong phrase—it is the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
language of the marketplace. There will never be efficient provision of resources for special educational needs, which are of course, expensive. Even if we amend the order today, I would be much happier if we could make it clear that we are not talking about the efficient use of resources, but the effective use of resources. The language of the marketplace has no role in such a measure. The stipulation that resources should be used efficiently is a get-out for any educational administrator who can say that the use of resources is not efficient by the general yardstick of how much we spend on children. What matters for the child is that the use of those resources should be effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like some information on special educational provision in institutions outside Northern Ireland, to which reference is made on page 11. Northern Ireland has a population of approximately 1.6 million. What are the shortfalls in provision? My background is in an education authority covering a population of 2.25 million and even an authority of that size could not provide from its resources all that was required for children with specific needs—perhaps one in 100,000. It would be interesting to know how much is spent on provision outside Northern Ireland, in Great Britain and possibly in the Republic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Linked with that, but on a smaller scale, is collaboration. What provisions will exist for liaising with other education and library boards within Northern Ireland? What mechanisms exist? We still have five education and library boards in Northern Ireland, which are small in relation to the populations that they serve. There is no way in which an education and library board can provide from its own resources for every special need that will crop up. What are the budgetary mechanisms and the general role played by DENI to ensure adequate provision for all special needs in Northern Ireland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I turn to the definition of special educational needs. That definition is fairly narrow and its language relates to learning difficulty and those with below average educational achievement. The document does not provide a perspective for dealing with gifted children. Does the Minister envisage the parents of a very gifted child being able to tell a special educational needs tribunal that their needs are not being met within the system?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document does not provide a perception of special educational needs in terms of emotional and behavioural difficulties and it has been criticised for that. Does the Minister consider that it has been relatively easy for parents of children with emotional and behavioural difficulties to get special provision within the system?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are some of the issues that arise in part II of the order and I hope that the Minister will respond to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
	<p>10.54 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I could comment on the practice of Orders in Council, but our views are well established. Efforts are being made to overcome the problem and I hope that they succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An increasing number of parents are asking for earlier assessment and statementing of their children and demanding adequate provision for schools to meet certain specific needs. The parents of children suffering from dyslexia are especially dissatisfied with the current provision. As a board member, I know that it has been almost impossible to keep up with the increased demand on the psychology service for statementing. There is a considerable backlog and we have experienced difficulty in recruiting staff. During the past 12 to 14 months there has been some improvement, but the time lag is still unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister continue to monitor the position throughout the Province and, where there is a recognised need to appoint additional school psychologists, provide the necessary funding and approve such expenditure? I concede that there has been considerable improvement, but more still needs to be done. In addition, given the difficulty in recruiting professionals, will the Minister monitor the numbers of new graduates entering the profession? Equal opportunities are working well—perhaps better in some sectors than others—but there should be adequate numbers of trained graduates in anticipation of growing demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the proposal to establish a special needs tribunal, and I genuinely hope that the facility will not be abused. There should be some filtering before cases reach tribunals. Some complaints that go before tribunals come from small groups of parents who cannot be satisfied. Although I respect the right to complaint, I hope that some protection will be provided because of the time taken up by mischievous complaints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most parents of children with identified special needs wish those children to be educated in a normal school setting with other members of the family and their peer group. Although I fully support that, it places an additional burden on staff, and whatever further resources are required should be made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is apprehension among head teachers and teachers about the proposal to involve lay persons in school inspections. Professionals respect the need for inspection, and I believe that they, too, expect to be inspected by professionals. Will there be training for the lay person involved in school inspection and will those chosen for that role already have a qualification in another profession or discipline not related to education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would seem desirable that a lay person should have training, but there is a risk that such training could disqualify them from the role. Article 102A(2) says that a person with
	<br><blockquote><p>"significant personal experience in the management of relevant establishments and the provision of education"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
cannot qualify as a lay member. As soon as a person knows anything about the job, they are disqualified from it. In those circumstances, how can training be provided?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not presume to answer that question, which would be better addressed to the Minister. I leave him to deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.2 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Members for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) and for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) for the way in which they have responded to the order. I am sure that all hon. Members await the day when such procedures are no longer required. I have made it clear several times on the Floor of the House, when wearing my other hat as a Minister with responsibility for political development that I aim to achieve an agreement with all parties and all sections of the community in Northern Ireland. That would allow debates on such matters once again to take place in democratically elected and accountable institutions in Northern Ireland. In that sense, we are on common ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I deal with the specific points raised, I should like to make another general observation. I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie and was pleased for his sake that he had begun to adopt what might be called the new Labour approach to economics; he demanded considerable extra expenditure without suggesting how to fund it. The only difference between the new Labour approach in Northern Ireland and that adopted in the rest of the United Kingdom is that Northern Ireland operates a block system. Any increase in expenditure in one sector must come at the expense of another, so we have to make a judgment on the balance of priorities every year and assess the key areas for expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie talked about the efficient use of resources, appearing to suggest that a market philosophy was at work that would damage the interests of special and other education in Northern Ireland. Using resources efficiently is important in many sectors. We must ensure that the resources available for Northern Ireland are spent efficiently and effectively, to the maximum advantage of all those involved in education. If the hon. Gentleman considers that more fully than he had when he reaised the point, he will understand that it is a sensible requirement for all expenditure in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the specific points that have been raised. The hon. Member for East Antrim asked about lay inspectors. It is not our intention that they should be involved in the inspection of teaching and curricular issues. Their function is to bring a commonsense approach to other aspects of the school, such as finance and administration. A lay person with outside experience may be better placed to consider those aspects than those who are concerned solely with the inspection of education. They will consider issues such as financial management and staffing structures. Our intention was never that they should be involved in the inspection of educational matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
As the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie said, training such people to become inspectors in the fullest sense of the word causes the value of their outside experience to be lost. That is the reason for the order's provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie was concerned that the framework was top-heavy and legalistic, and that it would create problems. An earlier proposal to set up board-based local appeal committees was withdrawn, following strong representations that they would not be perceived as independent. That consideration was the main reason for setting up the tribunal in its present form. However, a key objective of all those involved will be to ensure that the tribunal proceedings are conducted with minimum formality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The presence of lawyers at the new tribunal's hearings will be discouraged. To underline that, hon. Members will note that appellants are entitled to seek legal aid for the preparation of their cases, but that it is not intended to extend that to legal representation at the hearings. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that the purpose of that is to keep hearings as informal as possible. Sitting alongside the chairman, who will be legally qualified, will be two lay assessors. Again, we hope that that will lead to the sort of informal hearing that the hon. Gentleman rightly wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie queried article 15. The duty on a board to serve a notice on a parent that it intends to assess a child's special needs is not a legalistic mechanism; it is a means of ensuring that parents are fully informed of the board's intentions and of their rights to make representations. The hon. Gentleman will understand the value of informing parents of their rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of the experience of the tribunal in England, and suggested that the proposed framework might lead to more appeals. It is difficult to judge that possibility at this stage. In England, there was a considerable increase in the volume of appeals during the first year of that tribunal's operation, but numbers are expected to level out as precedents are established, both by the tribunal itself and by court judgments following appeals from the tribunal. It was, perhaps, inevitable that there would be a rush of appeals at the beginning, but we think that numbers will stabilise. We expect the same to occur in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the questions of finance and resources, the hon. Members for Clydebank and Milngavie and for East Antrim asked how many educational psychologists would be available, and what special provision was being made for that. That is one area of special education for which funds have been earmarked or ring-fenced. As the hon. Member for East Antrim will know, special education has recently substantially benefited from the additional recurrent allocations of £2 million in 1994–95, £3 million 1995–96, and additional teaching staff to the tune of £1.6 million. In conjunction with other elements, those extra moneys have funded a significant number of additional psychologist posts, which is where the greatest
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
pressure is currently estimated to lie. The hon. Member for East Antrim asked whether we would continue to monitor the need for special educational psychologists, and I can assure him that we shall do so—we recognise the importance of that provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In more general terms, the full cost implications of the order cannot be quantified at this state. However, where a board considers that the provisions carry additional cost implications that cannot be met from existing resources, there are normal channels in the ordinary public expenditure process for presenting a case for additional resources. Provided that the bids are fully substantiated and quantified, I shall give them the fullest possible consideration within the constraints—as is always the case in a block system—of the totality of resources available and other competing pressures. It is helpful that the code of practice will not come into effect until September 1997 because that will allow a full year for resource implications to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the totality of expenditure on special education in Northern Ireland. Excluding the local management of schools' budgets, that is running at £34 million a year. All schools also have a proportion of their budgets calculated for special needs. It is right that it is up to them to decide how they use their money. Parents can of course ask at annual parent meetings how the money is spent, and boards of governors are, quite rightly, accountable to parents. That constraint is the correct way to deal with a school's use of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not satisfied with that. If money has been identified specifically for special needs, there should be a proper check and examination—perhaps a random check by the Northern Ireland Audit Office—to ensure that such money is used only for that purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman has to say, but he will appreciate that the purpose of the local management of schools was to devolve decision making to them. It is right that schools should consider what is available and decide, within available resources, how their budgets should be spent. I am anxious for that to be done in an accountable way. It is possible for parents to pursue that matter at annual parents' meetings and, as I have said, boards of governors are accountable to parents. I know that the hon. Gentleman is a member of a board and I understand that he may feel differently about the matter, but if we are to give schools the right to make decisions on how money is most effectively spent, we must be cautious about how much accountability we seek from them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The annual parents' meetings throughout the Province are a disaster. Annual reports are circulated to parents two weeks before the duly notified meeting. It is virtually impossible to get parents to attend the meetings, and governors and headmasters have to contrive some sort of sideshow to attract them. The system is not working. Probably
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
only about 0·02 per cent. of eligible parents turn up. That must be addressed because there will be no accounting to parents—many of whom do not know the questions to ask—if they do not turn up to ask the questions. I want proper accounting and accountability, even if it is only random requests from your Department for information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should know that I do not have a Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Sir David, for that clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard what the hon. Gentleman said, but part of the purpose of the reforms to which he refers and which do not fall under this order, was to involve parents more. I am keen to generate greater interest by parents because it is the parents and, in particular, their children, that education is about. The more we can involve parents the better. I should not like anything that reduced rather than increased the incentive for parents to become involved in education. I heard what the hon. Gentleman said about how the system is working at the moment. I could reassure him by saying that the general inspectors' report will consider all aspects of schools, including special education. The matter will not be ignored in the absence of parents turning up. That fallback in the system is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie referred to article 3 and the definitions concerning language. The purpose of the order is to deal with children with innate learning difficulties. Children whose first language is not English have short-term problems, but they are not innate learning difficulties in the strict sense, and will be covered through special needs provision in the school and extra support from the board when necessary. Boards will also pay for interpreters to facilitate parent-teacher meetings to discuss progress, but the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that that is a different, although important, aspect from that covered by the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about gifted children. Although the needs of such children are not the direct concern of the present legislation, which concentrates on the range of problems faced by children with physical, sensory or learning difficulties, schools may seek advice from the boards' educational psychology services on how best to develop special potential. The nature of any special help provided by schools will vary from case to case, but is likely to include bespoke work programmes and the supply of additional books and materials. For especially gifted children, we consider it to be in their best interests to develop with other children of the same age, but schools should at the same time seek opportunities for them to meet adults with specialised knowledge in areas of particular interest. Boards will continue to offer what additional help they can to meet the needs of those pupils, as is the case with all others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked how many children have been placed outside Northern Ireland. At present, of some 7,800 pupils are who are statemented by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
boards, approximately 80 are placed in schools outside Northern Ireland, mainly in specialist schools and colleges in Great Britain. The hon. Gentleman knows that some specialist schools are valuable in what they can provide and it is right that that facility should be available. He asked for the cost figures, but I do not have them to hand and I will write to him about that if he wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Antrim, East (Mr. Beggs) referred to dyslexia. The word is generic, and dyslexia is not regarded as a single condition that can be dealt with in the same way for each pupil. That is important in considering how it is dealt with. The emphasis is on early diagnosis of individual problems with highly structured programmes to remedy them. Such help for pupils with significant reading difficulties is available within schools, supplemented by intensive reading courses and specialist teaching provided by the boards. I accept that that is an important matter and I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that it is being addressed. We may not have found the total answer yet, but we are considering it seriously and I hope that he will see even further improvements in the way in which it is dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that he may have one or two other matters to raise in connection with the order, but I hope that he and the hon. Member for Antrim, East feel that I have dealt fully with their questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.19 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before leaving the subject of special educational needs, I want to raise two matters that I intended to raise earlier and which are particularly relevant to drawing up the code. As the Minister said, the order consolidates a measure covering England and Wales. It is interesting that in England and Wales the guidelines on special educational needs that were given to education authorities and parents included time limits. They were given instructions on when the appeals had to be submitted and on the conditions for those appeals. Should not such time limits have been imposed on the special educational needs tribunal? Nothing could discredit the order more than if people were to appeal only to experience a long delay. When it comes to their children's education, people want a solution to the problems in the current academic year. If they experience a long wait when cases go to the tribunal, disillusion will set in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In drafting the code and deciding the provision of resources, the Government should be saying that they expect proceedings to have been dealt with by the tribunal within a specific time limit. That has been the case in other circumstances. The Government need to provide the necessary resources to ensure that time limits can be met. Otherwise, parents will submit their appeal within two months or whatever the period is, the education authority will submit its report on time, and then the whole process will grind to a halt. The Minister should be able to assure the Committee that the code will reach not only the parents and the education and library boards, but the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
I raise the next issue because I want to be helpful and refer to problems that have occurred in England and Wales. The chairman of the special educational needs tribunal in England and Wales felt it necessary to issue a direction to members of the tribunal on 15 March 1995 because a problem was occurring within the working of that tribunal. In that direction he stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Recent discussions have revealed that chairmen and members of the tribunal are divided in their views of the nature of our task. There are two alternative views of the question which the tribunal should be addressing. The two questions are: (1) was the LEA's decision"—</p></blockquote>
in the case of Northern Ireland, that would mean the education and library board's decision—
	<br><blockquote><p>"right when it took it, on the evidence it then had? 	<i>or</i> (2) what is the appropriate decision at the date the tribunal hears the case (in effect, a rehearing)?"</p></blockquote>
To avoid problems that have occurred in England and Wales, that matter should be dealt with by the code. The special educational needs tribunal in England and Wales said, strangely enough, that it was not examining the quality of the education authority's decision-making process, but the evidence, which may be different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That difficulty cropped up in England and Wales at an early stage, so we should take action to stop the same problem arising before the tribunal gets underway in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the Minister's response to my earlier point. Will he reflect however, on his use of the word "innate"? I understand his comments about the short-term difficulties experienced by people coming to Northern Ireland whose first language is not English. However, he is being too narrow when he defines special educational needs as only referring to innate problems. Problems will occur because of the child's upbringing—because his or her emotional needs are not met. Those issues are not innate. The Minister may want to change his definition. In his response he was bound to miss out some of the points raised by members of the committee and he did not deal with the impact of the measure on provision for the behavioural and emotional needs of children. His use of the word "innate" implied that his definition of special educational needs was narrower than mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's comments on the need to set up a board-based appeal mechanism for parents as soon as possible. A board-based adjunct to a board-based tribunal or committee would not be satisfactory for parents who wanted an assurance that the appeal mechanism was genuinely independent. However, there are alternatives to a board-based or legalistic mechanism. It would be possible to set up a Province-wide appeal mechanism headed by people with relevant expertise, who were not linked to a board. I am still sceptical as to whether the legalistic framework is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.26 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to an earlier question on whether we intend to consult parent's groups, I can confirm that we shall do so because we want to establish a genuine consultation process. I also apologise for not having mentioned behavioural and

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
emotional needs, which are an important aspect of education. I have had many discussions with various people involved in that aspect of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am impressed—not just because I am the Minister responsible—by the quality of education in Northern Ireland. Excellent initiatives have been taken in many schools on special needs—for which there is excellent provision—and on problems such as behavioural and emotional needs. I welcome those initiatives and look forward to seeing the results. Such provision is certainly not being ignored and I pay tribute to the education service for the work that is being carried out in schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie asked about time limits on tribunals. Tribunals will endeavour to hear and determine all appeals as quickly as possible. Time limits will be set within the rules of operation of the tribunals for each of the stages preliminary to the hearings. The tribunals will endeavour to determine all appeals on the day of the hearing. It is important to put that on record, but it would not be sensible to set firmer targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the directive referred to by the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie in relation to the president in England. The Northern Ireland tribunal will have its own president, and such important matters will be decided at the outset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also queried my use of the word "innate". I accept that too legal a construction of the word would be wrong because that would include long-term learning difficulties and other problems. I was referring to problems such as those involving a language other than English, which are different from the serious problems that the order attempts to address. It is possible to learn English, particularly when living in a country where English is spoken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.29 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply. I am not satisfied with his comments about time limits for the tribunal. From his earlier life as a barrister in Scotland, the Minister will know of the formidable discipline imposed on criminal cases in the Scottish legal system by what is known as the 110 days rule. That makes the courts jump about a bit. There would be immense value in putting the same time limits on the educational needs tribunal as apply to the preliminary stages. If it cannot meet those time limits due to lack of resources, the onus to provide those resources will revert to the Minister. Otherwise, the system will be undermined. I invite the Minister to discuss the other parts of the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I addressed the order in my opening remarks and referred to several other issues, but I understood from what he said earlier that the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) wished to ask some questions and I am prepared to respond to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise a number of other issues that arise from the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
Article 27 on page 24 relates to school attendance orders. The order imposes a duty on educational library boards to progress school attendance orders. I regard non-attendance at school as a very important matter, but what guidelines are given to schools by the Department of Education for Northern Ireland or by education and library boards about what constitutes non-attendance at school?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from experience that interpretation by schools of non-attendance varies greatly. Truancy and non-attendance is a complicated matter. Some pupils miss particular lessons with particular teachers, some like to work a four-day week rather than a five-day week and in some cases absence is condoned by parents. The order should consider the stages before a school attendance order is served, as well as what sanctions apply once a school attendance order has been served. What problems does the Minister envisage prior to the service of a school attendance order, and what mechanisms will come into operation if the school attendance order does not have the desired effect?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 32 on corporal punishment seems very strange. The Minister referred to old Labour, but the article reflects old Toryism with a vengeance. No doubt the Minister and other Conservative Members were thoroughly whacked in their youth and do not wish to deny that privilege to their successors. They may say that it did them no harm, but I can tell them that, from my perspective, it did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is that proposal for the refinement of corporal punishment in independent schools included in the order? I would have thought that the order presented an opportunity to abolish corporal punishment in every school in Northern Ireland. Corporal punishment has been abandoned in state schools in England, Wales and Scotland, and in grant-aided schools in Northern Ireland. Why do the Government not take this opportunity to say that corporal punishment is unacceptable in any school in Northern Ireland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Action against corporal punishment followed recourse to the European Court of Human Rights. By a strange coincidence, one of the people who caused the change in the United Kingdom was a constituent of mine. Therefore, I have followed the procedure for nearly 20 years—one of the ladies involved started at the European Court of Human Rights in 1977.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than 50 major organisations in the United Kingdom support the aim of ending all physical punishment of children. A recent opinion poll showed that 90 per cent. of respondents believed that it should be a criminal offence to beat children with implements. Yet this measure simply refines how children can be beaten in independent schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1976, two parents of children attending Scottish schools complained about the use of corporal punishment to the European Court, claiming it breached the protocol in article 2. In 1982 and 1983, the European Court pronounced in favour of those parents. In 1986, England and Wales abandoned corporal punishment in state schools. In 1991, the Government voluntarily signed the United Nations

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
convention on the rights of the child. Let me read from article 19 to which the Government signed their agreement:
	<br><blockquote><p>"States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation".</p></blockquote>
The Government signed up to that in 1991, but for independent schools, they want merely to refine the article.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me quote from the order. I find what is being proposed meaningless. Article 32(3)(1A) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where, in any proceedings, it is shown that corporal punishment has been given to a pupil by or on the authority of a member of the staff."—</p></blockquote>
it seems to be authorising non-staff members to punish children—
	<br><blockquote><p>"giving the punishment cannot be justified if the punishment was inhuman or degrading."</p></blockquote>
That has already led to absurdities and will continue to do so. In 1994, the European Court of Human Rights
	<br><blockquote><p>"held, by five votes to four,"—</p></blockquote>
that is the absurdity one gets into—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that corporal punishment consisting of three whacks with a rubber-soled gym shoe on the bottom of a seven-year-old boy by the headteacher of an independent private school was not severe enough to constitute 'degrading punishment' which violated article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, even though it was imposed automatically as part of the school's disciplinary system, the boy had been at the school for only five weeks, and the punishment was administered three days after the boy was told he would be corporally punished".</p></blockquote>
The thought of the European Court of Human Rights being asked to judge on such absurdities is mind-boggling. If the child was five, rather than seven, would that be inhuman or degrading? If a wellington boot rather than a slipper was used, would that be degrading? If the punishment had been opposed 10 weeks after the offence rather than three days, would that be degrading?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an absurdity about this and the Government should have taken the opportunity today to tidy up the law and to make it quite clear that there should be no physical punishment in any school in Northern Ireland. That would be in line with the Government's policy, not just in respect of the UN convention, but in respect of a response by DENI—the Department of Education in Northern Ireland—to the Standing Advisory Committee on Human Rights which wrote about draft article 32. DENI responded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This provision will bring Northern Ireland into line with Great Britain legislation, which was changed to reflect a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights … It would be a matter of national policy to move to a position of abolishing corporal punishment in all schools."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister explain why he has simply tried to tidy up legislation with this order instead of removing corporal punishment from all schools in Northern Ireland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

voice of old Labour reasserting that parents do not count and that the Government and the state know best. That was the import of the hon. Gentleman's argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the free choice of parents to send their children to independent schools. There is ample provision for all children in Northern Ireland's grant-aided system, but parents who want to send their children to independent schools know what such schools can provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard the same argument in Scotland in my days in Scottish politics. The idea is that Members of Parliament such as the hon. Gentleman and I occupy some lofty position that allows us to tell parents what forms of discipline should be available for their children. Parents choose to send their children to independent schools, and the hon. Gentleman's argument flies in the face of the principle of choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In Northern Ireland, almost 100 per cent. of pupils go to grant-aided schools in wich corporal punishment is prohibited. However, it is strange that the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie should take the argument further and say that parents' choice in Northern Ireland should be limited in a way that does not apply in the rest of the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a former teacher and vice principal of the biggest county secondary school in the Province, I occasionally used and sanctioned the use of corporal punishment in school. Each use was recorded, even before there was any requirement to keep such records. I never once had a complaint from a parent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a successful campaign for Europe to impose its will on parents in Northern Ireland who cannot afford to send their children to independent schools. However, if a proper poll were taken among such parents, I am sure that they would seek the right of schools attended by their children to use corporal punishment. The horror of indiscipline is reflected in the increasing number of suspensions and expulsions. There is an absence of real sanctions in the classroom against the unruly bullies who disrupt the education of the 99 per cent. of youngsters who are committed to benefiting from every classroom activity. The vast majority of parents—not only those included in opinion polls—want discipline to be restored to our classrooms and schools. That is not because youngsters were flogged, or because of the emotive language of "stop" campaigners, but because teachers and principals showed good common sense in the past in using an option that is no longer available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman suggests that there should be a different dispensation in Northern Ireland. Given the remarks of the hon. Member for East Antrim, he might realise that his approach does not enjoy great favour with elected representatives from the Province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie spoke about school attendance. Article 27 consolidates the provisions that already apply to school attendance orders. We have taken the opportunity to clarify the situation of pupils who are subject to a school attendance order and a statement of special educational needs. Where a statement already exists, the school attendance order must name the school that appears in the statement. If a school attendance order already exists but the statement names a different school, the order must be amended to name that school. The hon. Gentleman raises a wider point, which does not strictly arise in the context of the order. It is perhaps a matter for another debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister on avoiding every question that was put to him—he has lost none of his skill. The main fact that he adroitly avoided is that the Government signed the UN convention on the rights of the child. That document did not say that kids could be belted in independent schools but not in state schools—it simply said that such things should not happen. The Government committed themselves to that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also failed to address the fact that, in its response to the Standing Advisory Committee on Human Rights, the Department of Education in Northern Ireland said that it was Government policy to phase out corporal punishment in all schools. The Minister says that we are getting into line with the situation in independent schools in England and Wales. That ignores the fact that a huge amount is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
done differently in Northern Ireland. As the Minister knows, that is called devolution of powers to reflect the different position there. When the Government sign a United Nations convention and treat it as lightly as this, that demeans both the Government and the convention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolute rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says, "Absolute rubbish." Article 19 makes it clear that physical violence to children should stop. There are no codicils. That is everybody's interpretation of the UN convention, but the Government are ignoring that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 33 of the order deals with the appointment of lay persons to take part in inspections. There is a link with my previous point. The Northern Ireland Office has not followed the practice in England and Wales, because the lay person is to be attached to the inspectorate, whereas in England and Wales the inspectorate has been abolished and replaced by Ofsted, so there is already a difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the English and Welsh experience—which is some time ago now—why does the Minister want to bring in lay inspectors? It must have been a strange experience for the draftsmen to be told by the civil service, "We want you to draft a clause saying that the only person qualified for this position is someone who is totally unqualified for it. If a person has any relevant experience or background, he cannot be an inspector." Why are the Government following the English and Welsh pattern? What have we gained from having lay inspectors? If the Government want to know why teachers are demoralised, it is because of such measures. The Government would never dare to bring inspectors into other professions who know nothing about the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all seriousness, I ask the Government for information on the provision on the incorporation of schools, because the Minister did not cover that. What will be gained from that? What protection does it give to Government bodies? How does it alter how they behave? Does it give them permission or scope to borrow? What does it do about assets? What protection does it give to governors? I do not think that the Minister dealt with those matters, so he may want to respond to those points before I come on to the incorporation of colleges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.53 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving me the chance to intervene. I may save him from coming on to the incorporation of colleges by saying that the provision on the incorporation of schools and further education colleges has the same purpose as the provision on the incorporation of colleges and it is not the one that was announced in the statement that I made in September. That matter will arise later. I have had forewarning from the hon. Gentleman that when it does arise, he will have some cogent comments to make. But I assure him that that is not what we are about here.

In this measure we are trying to ensure that members of governing bodies and boards are not personally liable for any action they may take in the discharge of their financial duties. We sought to do that previously. There are circumstances in which personal liability is not totally assured. This limited incorporation seeks to secure members against personal liability in the performance of their duties. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that for people who are on or who want to join governing bodies and boards, this is a matter of concern. It is right for us to seek to protect them from something that was never intended to happen, which is what the provision would do. In a sense it is a belt-and-braces provision, but it is limited to that circumstance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie also raised the matter of lay involvement in the inspectorate. I have made comments on that before, but it is important to appreciate that lay inspectors will complement, and not replace, the work of the normal team of professional inspectors. They will not judge teachers on their professional competence nor make separate comments, but they will contribute to the overall report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that it is useful to have a lay view on inspection of all public services, including education, because it brings in an outside view. Even the hon. Gentleman—despite his tendency in the past quarter of an hour to move back to old Labour and the view that Government always know best—must see that an outside view is useful in certain circumstances, particularly when it is directed at issues of organisation, management, business and finance in schools, which are not directly connected with teaching. The hon. Gentleman might, on reflection, accept that that is a good thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, at the risk of re-opening the debate on corporal punishment, the reason for bringing this aspect of Northern Ireland into line with the rest of Britain is to avoid contravening article 3 of the European convention on human rights, which outlaws treatment or punishment that is inhuman or degrading. The order is in line with that article and has been introduced for that reason. It may interest the people of Northern Ireland to hear that part of Labour's prospectus for education in Northern Ireland, but that is not strictly the order's intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.57 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should now like to deal with the incorporation of further education colleges. Although the order contains an article headed "Incorporation of governing bodies of institutions of further education", the Minister said that that was not the main message of the order, merely a technical point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain when and how there will be an equivalent measure in Northern Ireland to that in force in England, Wales and Scotland and can he say what form it will take? Will he give an undertaking that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
there will be full legislation that can be significantly amended and that it will include details of the membership of governing bodies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that my own college of further education now has a self-selecting and self-perpetuating governing body which decides upon its membership. One relies solely on the good faith of the people within that body to ensure that all people who have an interest in the college are represented in a fair way. That is not happening everywhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recent survey of 200 colleges in England and Wales found that 25 colleges did not have staff members on the governing body. It also found that 80 had no students on the governing body. I want the Minister to give an assurance that governing bodies of institutions of further education would always ensure that staff and students were represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister give us any information about how the bodies that will be incorporated under the order are to be funded? Will he follow the English and Welsh pattern and set up a further education funding council for Northern Ireland; or will he follow the Scottish pattern and retain all power in the Department of Education for Northern Ireland? Will he follow some other pattern of funding?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be done to ensure that incorporation is carried out in a way that enhances accountability? The Minister will know that, following incorporation, some English and Welsh colleges got into severe financial difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the measure that the Minister will introduce to back up the order, what will be done about capital expenditure? How is that to be controlled in future? Similarly, what does the Minister plan to do about post-16 education to ensure that schools and colleges co-operate rather than compete?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 16 months to July 1994 in England and Wales, 40 further education colleges and five sixth-form colleges were declared by the Further Education Funding Council to be technically insolvent. How does that finding affect the order? What safeguards are to be introduced? All those questions are of great interest to those of us who want to see how the Northern Ireland Office will avoid the pitfalls that befell the English and Welsh authorities. I hope that those questions were all in order, Sir David.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
