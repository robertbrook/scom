Draft Child Support (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Andrew Mitchell)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Child Support (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1996.</p></blockquote>
Most of the regulations, which were laid before the House on 26 June, are highly technical, but the package also includes important changes to underpin our commitment to the fundamental principles on which child support is based. These changes arise in four main areas, the first being reduced benefits directions. As that is likely to be of most interest to the Committee, I shall make it the final point in my speech.<br><br>
The second area is where the regulations make changes that flow from the introduction of the earnings top-up scheme, an extra-statutory scheme which is to be piloted in certain parts of Britain from October 1996. The regulations include provisions for earnings top-up to be treated in the same way as family credit in the maintenance formula provisions.<br><br>
Thirdly, the regulations introduce a beneficial change in the way in which housing costs, in respect of repayment mortgages, are calculated. Many parents find it difficult to obtain information about the current breakdown between interest and capital repayment charges and some lenders charge for providing such information. The amendment will enable the Child Support Agency to use information from a recent mortgage statement, which will make it easier for parents to provide acceptable information about their housing costs and introduce a valuable simplification of the administrative process for the agency, helping to reduce delays in completing assessments and reducing administrative costs and overheads.<br><br>
Fourthly, the regulations include a simplification of the appeals process. Regulation 2 amends the confidentiality rules to ease the appeals process by providing that parties to an appeal should specify if they wish their whereabouts not to be disclosed to the other party, rather than it being assumed automatically.<br><br>
There are other, technical changes. The regulations make minor technical changes to improve child support operations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Mildred Gordon <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bow and Poplar)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister explain the reason for the relaxation of the confidentiality rule?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a simplification which will speed up the process and make a sensible change in a measure that is unnecessarily cumbersome.<br><br>
Other minor, technical changes include important powers to assist the agency's ability to gather
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
information. Regulations 7 and 8 make provision to require a person to give information when a decision needs to be taken on whether to enforce an assessment, and what method of enforcement will be most appropriate.<br><br>
Regulation 8 will also allow the agency to gather information to decide whether a case can be taken on. Regulations 9 to 12 make minor corrective amendments to provisions governing effective dates and reviews. Regulations 18 to 24 make minor amendments to the maintenance assessment procedure and special cases regulations. Those are largely technical, or corrective.<br><br>
I come now to the reduced benefit directions. Just as an absent parent should pay maintenance if he can afford to do so, a parent with care should co-operate in the pursuit of maintenance unless she has a good reason not to do so. Currently, a parent with care who refuses to co-operate with the agency without good cause may have her benefit reduced by 20 per cent. for six months, followed by a reduction of 10 per cent. for a further 12 months. These penalties are an unfortunate necessity. Regrettably, too many people regard right to benefit as being free of any corresponding obligations. That is reflected in an unwillingness on the part of many parents with care to co-operate as they are required to do.<br><br>
We have been increasingly concerned about the large number of such parents. In the year 1995–96, the agency investigated more than 112,000 cases where the parent with care had indicated an unwillingness to co-operate. Good cause was accepted in fewer than 39,000 of these. Of even greater concern is the number of parents with care who do not make any contact with the agency to say why they do not feel able to co-operate.<br><br>
Following the recommendation of the Select Committee on Social Security, the Child Support Agency recently undertook a detailed investigation of the operation of the requirement to co-operate. In the sample survey used for the report, the parent with care had failed to make contact with the agency in no fewer than 45 per cent. of cases where a reduced benefit direction had been issued. That is clearly unacceptable. It is perfectly reasonable to expect a parent with care to make her case and this high non-compliance rate must lead to the conclusion that in at least some of these cases, there may have been fraud or collusion between the parents to avoid child support liability.<br><br>
It also appears that the problem is getting worse. In 1994–95, 19 per cent. of the cases investigated resulted in a reduced benefit direction. Last year, it was 24 per cent. This trend cannot be allowed to continue and we are forced to the conclusion that the current penalties are inadequate. This must be because the level of the reduction—less than £10 for the first six months; half that amount for another year and then no penalty at all—provides insufficient incentive for those minded to abuse the child support system.<br><br>
The regulations before the Committee today address these concerns. First, regulation 14 provides that the reduced benefit direction will be increased to 40 per cent. of the adult income support allowance for three years, to be immediately renewed if the parent with care continues to fail to comply. It is essential that the level of the benefit reduction reflects the seriousness of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0667">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
parent's decision not to comply. This increase will encourage the parent with care to think more carefully about her decision not to co-operate and encourage her to discuss her reasons with agency staff.<br><br>
Secondly, regulation 13 provides that every parent with care who gives her reasons for not co-operating in writing will have the benefit of a six-week cooling off-period. In all other cases, the Secretary of State will refer the case to a child support officer to consider imposing a reduced benefit direction immediately the parent fails to respond to the relevant notices.<br><br>
It may assist the Committee if I outline the new procedure. As now, when the parent with care applies for a relevant benefit, she will receive the CSA 12(c) letter which explains that she is required to co-operate with the agency and asks her to return a declaration saying whether she intends to claim good cause. If she returns the declaration saying that she thinks that she or any child living with her will be at risk of harm or undue distress if she co-operates, that point is considered.<br><br>
If she returns the declaration saying that she is prepared to authorise the recovery of maintenance or if she does not return the declaration at all, a maintenance application form is sent after 14 days. She will then be given 14 days to complete the form, after which a reminder is issued giving her another seven days if the form has still not been returned. The parent with care will then receive a letter asking her to return the form or give reasons in writing why she thinks she should not have to do so within two weeks or the case will, at the end of the two-week period, be referred to a child support officer to consider a reduced benefit direction.<br><br>
If, within two weeks, she gives her reasons why she should not be required to co-operate, she will be given six weeks before the case is referred to a child support officer to consider a reduced benefit direction, even though officials may not think that the reasons she gives are sufficient to justify good cause. Once the case has been referred to a child support officer, he will allow the parent with care a further two weeks to make representations before he makes a decision on the reduction in benefit.<br><br>
The agency's record in identifying good cause is excellent and a parent with care has nothing to fear by coming forward and making her case. Even those parents with care who fail to make any contact at all will still get a minimum of nine weeks to consider their position before a reduced benefit direction can be imposed. In addition, it will still be necessary for two agency officials to consider the case. The provision will encourage more parents with care to contact the agency and it will ease the agency's administrative burden.<br><br>
We are determined that parents with care will cooperate with the agency unless they have a genuine reason for not doing so. We shall match the proposed changes with improved procedures to ensure that all parents with care understand what is required of them and are given every opportunity to state their case. A parent with care who has a genuine reason for not cooperating and explains that reason to the agency will continue to be exempted. The proposals provide a greater incentive to parents with care who never contact the agency even when requested many times to do so,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
and to those who have no good reason for not cooperating.<br><br>
Taxpayers, many of whom have children, should not be expected to support other children, whose parents can afford to do so. The changes will also encourage parents to comply with the agency. They will encourage parents who have a genuine reason for not complying to discuss it with the Child Support Agency.<br><br>
I am grateful for the support of the all-party Select Committee on Social Security, which recommends that the changes to legislation should be perceived as an interim reform. The Committee made four detailed recommendations for improving the operation of the good cause provisions. We are in the process of tightening the procedures. We shall consider carefully how the Select Committee's recommendations can be fitted into the process before responding formally.</span></p>
<p>4.41 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Wicks <span class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to focus on one important aspect of the regulations, namely, the proposal to increase reduced benefit direction to 40 per cent. of the adult income support allowance for three years, and to renew it thereafter. It means £19.16 a week, which is a considerable sum in terms of the total income of a lone parent.<br><br>
While the Committee is rightly worried about collusion, we must ensure that we do not produce regulations and support a benefit reduction that might harm women who are in genuine fear of violence from fathers if they co-operate with the CSA. That social issue is worth considering carefully.<br><br>
Collusion is a problem, and the number of benefit reductions increased from 4 per cent. in 1994 to 9 per cent. last year. However, collusion should be placed in the context of a range of reasons for the failure of parents with care to co-operate with the CSA. The reasons include fraud and collusion, but also confusion, complexity, and fear of violence.<br><br>
Let us consider fraud. The act of triggering child support assessments has encouraged some parents with care to stop claiming income support. That suggests that, in many cases, the receipt of the benefit was fraudulent, perhaps because the parent was in employment or living with a partner and falsely claiming lone parent status. Once child support assessments are under way, one parent or another sometimes alleges that a fraudulent claim has been made. Whatever the reason, the Opposition are determined that the CSA should play its role in eradicating fraud.<br><br>
The Department of Social Security conducted a review of parents with care., It showed that in almost half of the 72 non-co-operation cases that were studied, fraud or a serious suggestion of fraud had occurred. Is the Minister satisfied with that statistical sample? It was not the most scientific survey undertaken by Government. I do not want to dismiss the results, but they should be treated with caution.<br><br>
I asked the Minister about specific evidence for collusion. Not much evidence exists for collusion when compared with that for fraud. Does the Minister have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0668">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
more data? There is anxiety about collusion, which occurs when a deal is done between the parents and the father says, "If you do not co-operate with the CSA, if you do not say who I am or where I live, I will give you money each week—£20 or £10—so I will do better and you will do better as well." That can take place only because of an absence of a disregard. If there was a disregard and mothers on income support gained a cash benefit from child maintenance, this would be a lesser problem.<br><br>
I acknowledge the importance of the issue of collusion, although I repeat my request for firm evidence. However, we must not confuse collusion with other grounds for non-co-operation. Many mothers who receive communications from the Child Support Agency are confused; their marriage or relationship may have just broken up or they may be distressed about their income or housing. Understandably, they may not readily perceive the importance of a communication from the CSA. Often, they are not written in the most humane language—computer-produced letters are sent out—and for those reasons, mothers appear not to be co-operating with the agency.<br><br>
Many mothers do not want to co-operate with the agency. They understand what is happening, but the issue here is not violence—they simply do not want to bring the father back into the picture. The Select Committee took evidence on that matter. I have some empathy with the position taken by such mothers, but the choice that they make has a public cost. We must balance the concerns of the mothers against the interest of the taxpayers, who may be parents on low incomes who are providing for their children.<br><br>
Although I sympathise with mothers who may say that the last thing that they need is the matter being reopened, I acknowledge the public interest and, therefore, the need to encourage such mothers to cooperate. However, some mothers are in genuine fear of violence. Some parents with care fear that should they be required to co-operate with the CSA, they would be threatened by the absent parent and might become a victim of his violence. Indeed, there may already have been violence in the relationship. We acknowledge that many parents with care do not co-operate with the agency for valid reasons.<br><br>
I notice in the Department of Social Security review research that the commonest reason for the granting of good cause—good reason for not co-operating—is the fear of violence. It accounts for 73 per cent. of cases. We all know from constituency and advice surgery work that violence is a factor in modern family life and a major cause of family breakdown. Violence is part and often the cause of a cycle of poverty and dependency that exists for too many women—sometimes for men and children—in this country.<br><br>
We are dealing with difficult issues for public policy. I echo the Minister by paying tribute to Child Support Ageny staff who handle these issues professionally and sensibly. There has not yet been a case where the insensitive involvement of the agency has led to violence against a mother which is a tribute to those responsible for work at local level.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
This is a difficult issue because we are faced with a dilemma; we all want to protect the mother, but if we have procedures that let off the violent man, first, the woman is penalised again because she does not receive her child maintenance and secondly, the procedures reward the violent man by saying that he has no maintenance requirement. I realise that I am better at expressing the dilemma and challenge than suggesting solutions, but we need to discuss that issue further.<br><br>
The Select Committee, which addressed the issue with great interest and thoughtfulness, says in paragraph 38 of its report:
<br><blockquote><p>"In practice … the sanctions faced by violent men under the present system"</p></blockquote>
that is the present system of child support—
<br><blockquote><p>"are so weak that the system could almost have been designed with a view to protecting them."</p></blockquote>
That is the judgment of the Select Committee and it is an interesting comment. Given that we need social policies and laws that encourage good behaviour, rather than rewarding bad behaviour, we are on difficult territory.<br><br>
Having said that, Labour Members are determined that, notwithstanding our concern to eradicate collusion, the security of mothers must not be put at risk. The vital distinction between the mother who colludes in fraud and the mother who is in genuine fear has to be recognised. The attack on cheats is a high priority, but the safety of mothers who fear violence is absolutely paramount.<br><br>
Just as we are determined to stamp out fraud, we are determined to stamp out collusion. One means of achieving that at present is through a benefit reduction and we are being asked to consider today whether that benefit penalty should be doubled. We firmly believe that much of the blame at present lies with processes and practices employed by the Child Support Agency. Parents with care often find themselves dealing with a grey, anonymous bureaucratic organisation which corresponds with them by computer-produced letters rather than by face-to-face contact. It is wrong that someone can suffer a benefit reduction without even having the opportunity to meet and discuss matters with an official from the Child Support Agency.<br><br>
The Social Security Committee report, entitled "Child Support: Good Cause and the Benefit Penalty" says:
<br><blockquote><p>"According to the Review"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the Department of Social Security review—
<br><blockquote><p>"and other evidence to the Committee, it is very clear that personal contact between the Department of Social Security and the PWC"—</p></blockquote>
the parent with care—
<br><blockquote><p>"has deteriorated since the implementation of the Child Support Act. This is not in the interests of the genuinely vulnerable who may need direct personal contact with the Agency to help them make their claims for the good cause exemption, nor is it in the interests of the taxpayer who cannot be assured that fraudulent claims are not being allowed to proceed without any questions being asked."</p></blockquote>
The Committee also says in its report, comparing the present situation with the liable relatve system:
<br><blockquote><p>"One consequence of the change from the Liable Relative system.…"—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0669">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
that is, the system predating the Child Support Act—
<br><blockquote><p>"which is often mentioned, is the greater distancing of the process of awarding benefit from the process of arranging maintenance."</p></blockquote>
I noticed that the Minister said that he understood the Committee's concerns about the process and that improvements were under way, but I invite him to say more about his response to the Select Committee on that important issue.<br><br>
We believe that a programme of home visits is an important way ahead. Home visits can be a cost-effective way in which to reduce fraud, as the Select Committee said, and they would also help to deter and investigate cases of collusion. In suspected cases of collusion, there would be a full interview and frank discussions with the parent with care. In the interview, the importance of co-operating with the agency would be clearly stated and sanctions for collusion would be equally clearly spelt out. We also believe that the home visit could be important in those cases, which we take extremely seriously, in which women are in genuine fear of retribution from a former partner or husband. Through a home visit, mothers in genuine fear of violence could be reassured that their safety and security would be protected and respected.<br><br>
Agency staff could, in confidence and without pressure, give information about seeking advice and support from local police officers in cases of violence. Clearly, we must consider our concerns in the context of a more general strategy to combat and, we hope, one day to eradicate domestic violence in this country.<br><br>
The Select Committee came up with an interesting idea. It said that "all PWCs"—in English, that is parents with care—
<br><blockquote><p>"when they initially claim benefit should be issued with a Maintenance Application Form and the Benefits Agency staff should help them complete it. Those who have a problem with naming the AP of their children should then immediately be interviewed by senior staff trained for the purpose."</p></blockquote>
In other words, the Select Committee is asking whether it makes sense for the benefit entitlement to be an altogether different process from the discussions about maintenance and eligibility for maintenance. It is saying that there should be an interface between the two and that, indeed, they could take place at the same time. We recognise that the idea needs to be investigated and that there would have to be a pilot scheme before implementation, but we find it interesting.<br><br>
As well as talking about benefit entitlement and maintenance eligibility, the process of talking to lone parents about ways out of dependency could be started even at the first interview. Ideas about the benefit-to-work strategy could form part of that interview. It is time that we looked at the issue comprehensively rather than in the spasmodic and ad hoc way sometimes encouraged, albeit inadvertently, by the Benefits Agency structure.<br><br>
We believe that if we improve the efficiency and fairness of child support through a programme of home visits and perhaps through employing other means of investigation, the existing benefit penalty will prove to be an adequate sanction. For those reasons, we oppose the Government's policy of increasing the benefit deduction. We believe that their approach is wrong, and a poor substitute for the radical reform of child support
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
that is required. Indeed, given current practice, it could well be the case that the welfare of mothers with genuine reasons, such as the fear of violence, for not cooperating with the Child Support Agency could be harmed. I shall, therefore, invite my colleagues to vote against the regulations.</span></p>
<p>4.58 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Antrim)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Great concern has been expressed about the regulations by various groups and individuals. Before the proposals are fully implemented, we should make it absolutely certain that those who fall into the relevant category are fully investigated before a penalty is imposed.<br><br>
It is also essential that the recommendations in the Select Committee's fourth report be implemented as soon as possible. I remind the Committee that the object of the Child Support Act 1991 was to benefit children. When considering these matters and investigating whether the regulations are correct, we sometimes lose sight of that object in the discussion. We concentrate to a large extent on the absent parent or the parent with care and forget the children.<br><br>
I listened to both the earlier speeches and it seemed to me that the children were almost forgotten. I am sure that that was not intentional, and that none of my colleagues in the House would intend that, but that was the impression I received, and it is an impression that I have received in the House on other occasions. The main purpose of the Act—to be for the benefit of children—seems to be forgotten. Parents with care and absent parents should, perhaps, be forced to co-operate for the children's benefit.<br><br>
I have a number of concerns about the instrument, although I fully support the Select Committee's report. Let us consider the situation when a parent with care is sent a letter or form. That parent either returns the form, or it does not come back. It may be returned by a parent who says that she or he may be afraid or has good cause not to be involved with the CSA. Perhaps there is domestic violence or an issue of the welfare of the child.<br><br>
If the form is not returned, we must consider why. The review undertaken by the CSA came up with a few ideas. The letter or form may not be returned because of violence against the parent with care or the children, or because of the welfare of the children. The parent with care may be afraid to send the form back. Therefore, the parent does not send it and hopes that the CSA will go away.<br><br>
The parent may not understand the letter or form and feel that it is too complicated. Again, the parent gets rid of the letter, and some have said that they did not keep the letter. Again, the parent hopes that the CSA will go away and leave her alone.<br><br>
Of course there is, unfortunately, fraud in some cases. But in some cases, the parent with care may feel that the absent parent cannot afford the assessment that the CSA will make. In that case, although the relationship between the absent parent and the parent with care may have been reasonable, it will be completely destroyed. The absent parent may take it out on the parent with care.<br><br>
We should remember all those things when we consider reducing benefit for the parent with care. It is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0670">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
incumbent on the House to make sure that anyone who is entitled to benefit should get it; only those who are not entitled to it should be looked at in a different light.<br><br>
When I heard the evidence to the Social Security Select Committee about the review, I was startled to realise that only 72 cases had been considered. I know that the CSA has been operating for a considerable time. But if we are looking at only 72 cases, we should be careful about the conclusions that we draw. We can conclude that 50 per cent. of those cases involve fraud, but if there had been 500 cases and still only half of 72 involving fraud, the percentage would change. Provided that every care is taken, that the CSA bends over backwards to make absolutely sure that things are as it thinks they are when it reduces benefit, and that there is good reason for reducing benefit, perhaps we can consider the Government's proposals.<br><br>
The Select Committee on Social Security made two other proposals in its report. The first was that, where domestic violence is alleged, information should be provided to the parent with care about the local police domestic violence unit, so that help can be obtained if necessary. I appreciate that there is dispute and disagreement about this, but where violence is involved, it is incumbent on the CSA at least to inform the police about the situation. I emphasise again that we must consider the children in such a situation. If we properly consider the children, we may do the right thing.</span></p>
<p>5.6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Field <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birkenhead)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I merely wish to deal with those aspects of the Select Committee report that relate to the regulations, and to make two comments.<br><br>
First, Parliament has always been centrally concerned that any actions or changes to legislation should not make more vulnerable women who are vulnerable to violence from their husbands or partners. However, in saying that, the Select Committee found it very difficult to think what changes should be made to our laws to deal with people who enjoy beating up women because, although the law, hopefully, protects vulnerable women, it certainly does nothing to prevent such violence from occurring. Indeed, as my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North-West (Mr. Wicks) said, we currently seem to have rules that encourage bad, rather than good, behaviour. Although it is immensely difficult to make progress in that area, and while the Committee is mindful of the difficulties, we believe that the Government must begin a public debate on changing that stance because it is certainly advantageous to the thug. That side of British culture is not something to be applauded, let alone approved, by Parliament.<br><br>
Secondly, part of the problem is of the Government's own making in that, for almost a decade, they took no notice of the declining numbers of people who were paying maintenance for their previous partner and their joint children. Then they woke up to the issue, panicked and introduced what we now know—the Child Support Agency. But the agency conducts practically all its business by letter. Even if computers produce letters in English rather than pidgin English, it seems to us to be a doubtful way to advance. We are suggesting that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
Government should quickly introduce a reform whereby when someone applies for benefit—for income support—and rightly claims for children, the application form should be accompanied by a maintenance assessment form which would be filled in at the same time.<br><br>
Many of our constituents making a claim—about which they will be concerned and anxious—will be at a point of crisis. They may, like me, find it difficult to understand forms, even if they are written by clever people. We therefore also suggest that they should have the help of the officers of the agency to complete both forms. We do not believe that the process should be dragged on for as long as 39 weeks, which is often the case, before any decisive action is taken against those who decide that it is in their interests to put aside what Parliament has determined and make it a purely voluntary policy to fill in the necessary requirements so that fathers can start paying the essential maintenance for their children. That it has become a voluntary policy for a large number of mothers is the Government's fault. If we were to design a system to help mothers obstruct the will of Parliament, we could not have come up with a better policy than that in place at present.<br><br>
We do not want the Committee to see the benefit penalties in isolation from what we believe is the major reform required: that, at the commencement of benefits, those claiming benefit will fill in not only their income support application form but a maform—a maintenance application form. The process for those who decide not to fill in a maintenance application form will begin on day one, not many weeks or months later. It is crucial that, at that stage, people receive help from a fellow human being who is sympathetic and who understands that sometimes information is not readily to hand or not easy to put on a form. If people then refuse to fill in the maintenance application form, we believe that the penalties should begin right away.<br><br>
We also believe, as does the Opposition Front Bench, that it is vital that those who refuse to fill in the forms are followed up so that the rules can be explained again. As we all know, living on benefit for any time is tough. Living on benefit minus part of it is even tougher. If people are committing fraud or if collusion is occurring, experienced officers—who know very quickly when they walk into a house the level of that household's income—have a good idea, when explaining again the rules, whether it is necessary also to begin investigations for benefit fraud.<br><br>
One understands the Government's panic response, which was of their own making. But the figures continue to build up over a long period and the Government continue to believe that just by writing pidgin English letters to people they can run something this sensitive at a time when people are experiencing enormous emotional confusion and difficulty. Our plea is that the agency helps people to fill in their benefit application forms and their maintenance application forms at the same time. That would protect vulnerable mothers who were uncertain, while also sending the message to those who have decided that what Parliament has decreed should be only a voluntary policy that that is not our wish. In passing the regulations, I hope that the Committee will make it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0671">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
plain to the Government that it wants the whole of the Select Committee's package implemented quickly, not just part of it. I therefore support the contribution of the hon. Member for South Antrim (Mr. Forsythe), who is also a member of the Select Committee.</span></p>
<p>5.16 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Gordon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel compelled to speak because I am the only woman on the Committee and we are discussing regulations which will seriously affect the lives of many women bringing up children on their own—women who have already suffered a great deal in many ways. It is ironic that we should be debating a considerable reduction in the amounts on which lone mothers who do not co-operate with the Child Support Agency have to live, on the same day that the House is also considering increasing the salary of Members of Parliament. The regulations also cut down the time available to those mothers to make their case.<br><br>
We should consider the figures so that we understand clearly what we are talking about. A mother on her own has £47.90 benefit. A 40 per cent. cut would take away £19.16, leaving her with £28.74. A mother with one child under 11, who currently receives £80.10, will be left with £60.94 for the two of them to live on. Those are pathetic amounts. The regulations take a quarter of the family's income away. Lone mothers under 25 will get less. Teenage mothers will get less still.<br><br>
The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux says that it will condemn such mothers to
<br><blockquote><p>"a twilight existence on marginal levels of income, under surveillance from fraud investigators."</p></blockquote>
If we punish mothers by reducing their benefit, we punish the children and the whole family. If the family income is reduced, the mother cannot manage and the children suffer, but the Government have said that the Act was for the benefit of children.<br><br>
There are many reasons why mothers might refuse to cooperate. Two cases have been brought to my attention. In the first case, the mother feared that her children would suffer because the second wife had threatened to make difficulties when they went to stay with their father during contact time if she went to the agency. In another case, the children had lost contact with their father and were showing behavioural difficulties at school and at home. When contact was reestablished, the children's behaviour improved and they were much happier, but the father threatened to break contact again if the mother went to the agency. Again, the mother feared that the welfare of the children would suffer and did not feel that she could talk about the issue.<br><br>
Language difficulties might prevent many women from knowing what is expected of them, from understanding the forms or from being able to respond within nine weeks. There are literacy difficulties—and even literate people often have trouble with official jargon, as my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) has said.<br><br>
It is also a commonly accepted fact that women who have been battered by men often try to hide the fact from the world—even from their mother or their immediate family—because they feel ashamed. They
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
might feel that the problem was caused because they were in some way inadequate, or they might just feel that the matter was too awful and they did not want people to know what happened to them. That kind of embarrassment would also stop them reporting these incidents—either to the police or to the agency. So there are many reasons, other than that such people set out to be fraudulent. I am not sure to what extent they are to be penalised—first, it was to be a 20 per cent. penalty; now the Government want a 40 per cent. penalty. If that does not work, will they ask for a total cut of benefit?<br><br>
Even a 40 per cent. cut in benefit will leave many women absolutely on the margin, and they may be forced against their better judgment to do what the agency wants, knowing that the welfare of their children will suffer. Other women will not do that, so they may try to manage on very little money—going without food themselves and not being able to give the children an adequate diet, or to help them keep up with their classmates by providing them with the things which they need in school. Some will become desperate and steal a little food from the supermarket when they are shopping; some will even be forced into prostitution. We should not be pushing mothers to the wall like this and making them and their children suffer.<br><br>
A number of voluntary agencies have said that women do not come to them for help until they have actually had their benefit deducted. This may be because they are living fraught lives and are suffering all kinds of difficulties.<br><br>
For all the reasons that I have described, they may not be aware of what is happening and what it really means until they are in great trouble. By then they may be getting into debt, going to moneylenders, and the whole family has gone into a downward spiral.<br><br>
The regulations say that benefit can now be reduced for three years, and that that decision can be renewed—so it can be indefinite. Mothers who feel that their children's welfare will be affected—for the reasons that I have described, or for many other justifiable reasons—will be put in a desperate situation. Given the changing relationships between men and women, we have a serious problem with finding a good system of child maintenance and we have a serious problem of child poverty. Giving more draconian powers to the Child Support Agency will not solve these problems; it can only harm the children whom we want to help.</span></p>
<p>5.23 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate, and I shall try to answer as many of the points that have been raised as I can during a brief wind-up speech. If I do not answer any points, I shall of course write to the relevant members of the Committee.<br><br>
I respond first to the hon. Member for Bow and Poplar (Ms Gordon), who made an interesting speech about the effect of the regulations. The case that she makes is the case for good cause. That was the case that Parliament heard when the Act was passed, and the provisions of good cause deal with the points that she raised. If she would like to raise with me the two specific cases that she mentioned during her speech, I will of course consider them. I think that in the second case that she raised, the issue of welfare of the child
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0672">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
would come into play. If a parent with care pleads welfare of the child during the good cause process, the child support officer, when considering a reduced benefit direction, will take what is said into account. I hope that, in a number of respects, I will be able to satisfy the hon. Lady that the case that she made, and the important things that she said, are dealt with in the good cause process.<br><br>
The issue of whether the reduced benefit direction and the increase in it is justified and whether it will harm women has been central to the debate. I want to emphasise—I think that this deals with many of the points raised by Opposition Members—that no one needs to suffer a benefit penalty. Good cause is available to all who are at risk of violence or who have a genuine fear of violence. Others who could suffer harm are also allowed a good cause exemption. Those who are not exempt should, therefore, co-operate and so avoid the need for a reduced benefit direction. I emphasise my belief that no one need suffer a benefit reduction. Because of the difficulties that I outlined in some detail in my opening remarks, the measures before us today are necessary.<br><br>
I should like to answer a point raised by several Opposition Members, which relates to interviewing parents with care who claim good cause. It was suggested that such people are not interviewed. They are interviewed: all parents with care who claim good cause are offered an interview. The agency's review, to which the hon. Member for Birkenhead referred, indicated that 58 per cent. of parents with care were interviewed as part of the process. More than half of those who were not interviewed failed to contact the agency at any stage in the process.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Birkenhead made two key points. First, he said that we must not make women who are already vulnerable to a violent partner more vulnerable. I agree with the hon. Gentleman—no member of the Committee would disagree with him on that point. Secondly, the burden of his report, which is supportive of the changes before us today, is that benefit penalties are not an isolated matter, that good cause is a weak enforcement system and that the policy is, in effect, voluntary. I accept much of what he said on that point.<br><br>
As he knows from the letter that I sent him as my preliminary response to his report, we are considering a number of the Select Committee's helpful suggestions so as to take forward that agenda. In mitigation, I say that if the hon. Gentleman reads the debates on good cause that took place in the House, he will see the extent to which Members of Parliament on both sides of the House—from Lady Thatcher downwards—were worried about the issue of domestic violence. They were extremely concerned that we should create a framework that offered a proper way out, so as to ensure that vulnerable women were not made more vulnerable. The hon. Member for Croydon, North-West made it clear that the CSA has been immensely successful, saying that no known case of good cause had gone wrong, and he was right to say that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
I make that point because it is important to demonstrate that we, if not the Labour Front Bench, are grateful to the Select Committee for the report. I shall respond in detail to that report in due course. It was extremely helpful. I deliberately referred the matter to the Select Committee in order to hear its views. The Committee was supportive of the change and made many additional helpful suggestions.<br><br>
On the question whether a parent with care who does not co-operate is necessarily fraudulent, I say that no such assumption is made. However, it is known that there is a high level of fraud among lone parents and non-co-operation may be indicative of fraud in some cases. That was demonstrated in the study of 72 cases in the report on good causes, to which the hon. Member for South Antrim (Mr. Forsythe) referred. Although 72 cases is not statistically a very significant number, the hon. Gentleman will know from the weight of other comments made in that excellent report from the Child Support Agency that there is a running theme, which the draft regulations are intended to address.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Antrim also raised the matter of links with the police, to which the Select Committee referred on a number of occasions. The Chairman of the Select Committee, the hon. Member for Birkenhead, will recall that I gave evidence specifically on that matter when I appeared before the Committee. The CSA does not usually report to the police anything arising from a good cause interview, for the reasons I explained to the Select Committee, except in extreme circumstances where, for example, a threat of violence has been made or the officer becomes aware of criminal activity or child abuse. Following the good cause review, the CSA would welcome increased involvement with local groups dealing with domestic violence, which is one of the matters we are currently examining.<br><br>
Finally, I want to comment briefly in response to the hon. Member for Croydon, North-West on some of the recommendations concerning the ways in which we can improve the system. One was that a maintenance application form could be issued at the start of the claim. Both income support and family credit claim forms are being examined to decide the best way of raising the question of child support and maintenance at the benefit claim stage. A new claim visit is conducted in 20 per cent. of cases at present and the visiting officer will ask the parent with care to fill in a CSA form 12C. If the parent with care shows her willingness to cooperate, she will be issued with a maintenance application form.<br><br>
We are considering the recommendations made about regular visiting of those who plead good cause or have a benefit penalty imposed. Benefits Agency staff currently target all lone parents for review and as part of the closer working arrangements, the agency will arrange targeted review of cases when a reduced benefit direction has been imposed.<br><br>
It had been proposed that the Benefits Agency take forward action when good cause has been readily accepted by the parent with care and a pilot scheme is already running under which the Child Support Agency refers suitable cases for investigation.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0673">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
My final response is to the hon. Member for Bow and Poplar who asked whether we would continue to increase the level of benefit reduction if the provision does not work. That was a recommendation of the Select Committee which said that the matter should be kept under review and that it should be considered in the light of its other proposals whether that would be appropriate. That cannot be ruled out, but I hope that we are sending a clear signal in a variety of ways that no one need have a reduced benefit direction. The good cause provisions are very wide and should give the hon. Lady some comfort that we are handling the matter correctly and that no further increase will be required.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wicks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister about the key concern? Even with the new regulations, a mother may not contact the agency, perhaps because she is fraudulent, confused or traumatised by violence, but the benefit reduction of 40 per cent. would apply with all the consequences for the children that my hon. Friend the Member for Bow and Poplar mentioned. Would it not be sensible, before implementing the regulations, to have some human contact with the mother to clarify the situation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. That is why I sketched out in detail in my opening comments the many phases and the amount of time taken before a reduced benefit direction can be imposed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wicks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is done by computer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have made the point about the steps that are necessary to try to ensure that no one could be caught in that position. I do not believe that it is a valid point and I shall be disappointed if the hon. Gentleman
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
urges his hon. Friends to vote against the measure, despite the compelling evidence and the openness of our approach to the Select Committee and its advice. If he is unable to support the measure today, it will be a disappointing sign that, despite the warm words in his speech and his supportive comments in the earlier part of his speech, he is not prepared to put his vote where his mouth is for what needs to be done to keep our welfare budget under control with sensible reform. I hope that even at this late stage he will reconsider and support the Government in these necessary regulations.</span></p>
