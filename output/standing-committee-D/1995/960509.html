	<div class='legislation'>Social Security (Adjudication) and Child Support Amendment Regulations 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Social Security (Adjudication) and Child Support Amendment Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 182).</p></blockquote>
These regulations came into force on 28 February. They severely restrict the circumstances in which social security claimants can appeal to tribunals out of time. They also make changes to the rules for recording and preserving decisions. Those changes are not so controversial, so I shall not delay the Committee on that aspect of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must first consider carefully the previous position. Prior to 28 February this year, tribunals had a general discretion to grant a claimant permission to bring an appeal if he or she had not done so within three months. A claimant had to show that there were special reasons why he or she should be allowed to pursue an appeal. Even so, that was not easy and considerable hurdles had to be overcome. The claimant had to explain why he or she had failed to appeal within the time limit. Moreover, if leave was refused, it was extremely difficult to challenge that refusal through judicial review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, the system had the advantage that the chair of the tribunal had the flexibility to deal with each case individually on its merits, untrammelled by statutory prescription. These new regulations have removed that flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the new rules that have been introduced by these regulations? It will now be virtually impossible for claimants to obtain leave to appeal to tribunals out of time. Indeed, so high is the hurdle that the Government have erected that it might have been more honest for them to have legislated so that no appeals could be allowed at all. An application for an extension of time can now be granted only if, under the new paragraphs (3A) to (3D) proposed in regulation 2(2)(b),
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is in the interests of justice".</p></blockquote>
It is in the interests of justice if
	<br><blockquote><p>"special reasons exist, which are wholly exceptional"</p></blockquote>
and those special reasons must
	<br><blockquote><p>"manifestly constitute a reasonable excuse of compelling weight for the applicant's failure to make an appeal within the time specified."</p></blockquote>
The chair of the tribunal must ignore the fact that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the applicant or anyone acting for him or advising him was unaware of or misunderstood"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
the relevant law, including that relating to appeal time limits. That would presumably include erroneous advice given by the Benefits Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the applicant sought advice from Benefits Agency staff and was advised that he or she was not entitled to a component of a benefit, not surprisingly that claimant would accept that advice and a result would not immediately bring an appeal against that adverse decision. If, more than three months later, that person discovers that the Benefits Agency was, or might have been, wrong, he would be unable to cite the erroneous advice as a reason for bringing a late appeal against the decision. Will the Minister confirm that my understanding of the regulation is correct and that, in such circumstances, an appeal could not be brought?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Steen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Hams)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. I have an on-going case in which a constituent was placed in just such circumstances before the regulation came into force. The Benefits Agency managed to avoid its responsibility, as I see it, by claiming that there was not continuous good cause. It argued that the three-week delay could not be justified even though the applicant's father had died during that period. That was before the regulations came into force. I agree with the hon. Gentlamen that the Minister needs to clarify whether the new regulations will make the problem even worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. That is exactly the point. Under the previous rules—before 28 February—there was at least the opportunity for an applicant to make a request to the tribunal. The chair of the tribunal could use his discretion to determine whether there were grounds for a sympathetic consideration, according to the merits of the individual case. For example, in the case mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, the death of an applicant's relative would have been sympathetically considered by the chair of the tribunal. My understanding is that the discretion has been removed under the new arrangements so the death of a relative would be an insufficient ground for delay or even to argue with the tribunal. The case would not even reach that stage because of the constraints imposed by the regulations. The hon. Gentleman's example reinforce my point, for which I am grateful. We shall await the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second restraint is found in the new paragraph (3D) proposed in regulation 2(2)(b), which states that no account can be taken of a case in which
	<br><blockquote><p>"a Commissioner or a court has taken a different view of the law from that previously understood and applied."</p></blockquote>
In other words, the chair of the tribunal has to ignore the fact that an adjudication officer's decision has been shown to be wrong in law. Again, that ground, as I understand it, would not allow for an appeal or give the tribunal the discretion to hear an appeal. Can the Minister confirm that that is the case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am correct in both of my interpretations, Committee members will realise that circumstances would have to be extreme indeed before a claimant had any chance of getting leave to appeal out of time. Serious illness or disability, including mental
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0522">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
disability, might not be sufficient grounds for an out-of-time appeal. Can the Minister confirm that such circumstances no longer apply for late appeals? I refer him to the report by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments and the memorandum of the Department of Social Security, which raised questions about the original drafting of regulations or illness. As a result, the regulations have been redrafted but they do not make it clear whether such circumstances of illness can now apply as a ground for a late appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there is now a stop-gap for the Government of six years. No appeal may be brought more than six years after the decision has been made. I shall return to that issue a little later when I discuss the Government's justification of why the changes are required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us briefly compare the present arrangements with other areas of the law of appeal. The changes appear to place social security claimants who wish to appeal in a far worse position than other litigants. In other jurisdications, the court or tribunal concerned invariably has a general discretion about whether to extend the time allowed. Since February, the social security law has been changed to disallow that discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Court of Appeal, for example, the White Book's 1995 Commentary to the rules of the Supreme Court states that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"is entirely in the discretion of the Court to grant or refuse an extension of time."</p></blockquote>
Surprisingly, on Radio 4's "Moneybox" programme on 2 March, the Minister said that the new regime simply brought claimants into line with other litigants: indeed, even with the rules, claimants were in a better position than litigants wishing to appeal to the Court of Appeal. That is nonsense. The Court of Appeal has the unfettered discretion to allow late appeals. The regulations deny that opportunity to claimants through social security legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government justify the new rules by pointing out that late appeals have been granted against some very old decisions, which causes disproportionate administrative burdens on the social security agencies. That was the line used during the required consultation with the Council on Tribunals, but it is the old trick of using a perceived problem to justify a solution that is more far reaching than necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, the problem of very stale appeals has been dealt with by the introduction of the six-year stop-gap. The late appeals that the Government claim cause so much of the administrative burden and complexity will not be affected, as most appeals—as the Minister knows—apply to recent claims and not to cases that are more than six years old.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the same "Moneybox" programme, the Minister tried to draw an analogy with claims to industrial tribunals. He said—correctly—that an applicant who misses the three-month time limit for bringing a complaint against unfair dismissal, for example, has an uphill task getting the complaint accepted, but that analogy is very poor because industrial tribunals consider original claims, not requests to consider late appeals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
A letter dated 22 September from the Council on Tribunals stated that the council thought that it would be better if the question of discretion were dealt with by the president of the independent tribunal service—in other words, that discretion should not be circumscribed by regulations. That advice appears to have been ignored by the Minister, and I should be grateful for an explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a slightly more positive note, tribunal chairmen now have to give reasons for allowing or rejecting an application for a late appeal. However, that is likely to be of little practical use to claimants, as it will be virtually impossible to show that a decision to refuse an application is unreasonable in the judicial review sense of "unreasonableness". It will also not be capable of challenge. Although the tribunal chairman has had to make such a decision, one cannot then appeal against it. As the terms on which such an appeal have been severely limited, the measure is a double whammy on the applicant's individual rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must be clear about where exactly they are leading us. In a recent speech on the proposed changes to social security administration made to senior managers in the Department of Social Security on 28 February, the Secretary of State for Social Security said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our existing adjudication system is largely hidden from the claimant's view and is so bewilderingly complex that it is hard to see how it can generate confidence. Fundamental to the Change Programme will be a review of the legal basis of decision making and appeals. The outcome of the review must be that claimants get what they are legally entitled to, and that they have the right to challenge a decision."</p></blockquote>
It is ironic that the regulations seem to fly in the face of that avowed intention to restore confidence in the system and to ensure that claimants have a right to benefit and a right to appeal against decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to know whether, as a result of the regulations, the Government have any plans further to limit the right of appeal or even to do away with the appeals system altogether and to move further down the road of a general review of social security decisions—as is now the case with the social fund, for example—rather than having an unfettered right of appeal against decisions through the tribunal service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are serious matters. We must be clear that all our constituents have—and are seen to have—natural justice. They must have the right to appeal against decisions. The Government's measures will severely restrict both that right and the grounds on which people can try to exercise it. I hope that the Minister will be able to allay our fears and that he will answer my specific questions on individuals' rights of appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.47 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Steen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Hams)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that it is unusual for hon. Members to volunteer to serve on Statutory Instrument Committees, although the turnout on the Conservative Benches shows my hon. Friends' enthusiasm. It is rare, however, for hon. Members to attend Statutory Instrument Committees unless they have been commandeered to sit on them. I hope that I will not set a precedent by saying that I was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
moved to attend and speak not only because of the importance of the regulations, but in order to comment on one or two other aspects of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I must say that it is a pleasure to attend any Committee when you, Sir Alan, are in the Chair. To attend a Statutory Instrument Committee on which the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security is the Minister is an honour and privilege second to none; and the fact that the Whip is my hon. Friend the Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) is the final coup de grace—if I may use the French—which completes the pleasure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is strange that Whips have not changed over 22 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wealden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend not made his comments a little too exclusive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, but I was going to say that Whips have not changed over 22 years. They are specially bred, like superdogs at Crufts, to say the same things, even after 22 years. My hon. Friend the Member for West Derbyshire has been impeccably bred because before I got up to speak he said, "Keep it short". Whips said that 22 years ago. I decided that I would bear in mind my hon. Friend's exhortations and not mention some of the most exclusive and elusive members of the Committee, although my hon. Friend has occasionally said to me on the Floor of the House, "Keep it long". However, members of the Committee are busy people and I do not want to trespass on their time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory instrument came into force on 28th February; it is now May and so what we say we now cannot affect it. I do not agree with the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) that it is not controversial, but it does not matter whether it is or is not because statutory instruments do not have any force: no hon. Member can do anything about them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must make it clear that I did not say that the statutory instrument was not controversial; I said that aspects of it were less controversial than the points that I was making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that it does not matter what hon. Members on either side of the Committee feel about statutory instruments because they go forward whatever we say. I cannot vote because I am not a member of the Committee but, even if I could, I would be outvoted by one side or the other. It does not matter what one says; the important thing is to get it over quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. What the hon. Gentleman says matters a great deal in that it must be relevant to the instrument. If he wishes to have a general debate about statutory instruments, that would be for the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to make the debate general; I am simply commenting on the importance or otherwise of this statutory instrument and the fact that whatever one says about it will be of no avail. If it were opposed it would go ahead anyway because it would just come up again until we passed it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is simply a grand opportunity to question the Minister on whether he should have passed the instrument and to raise any other questions on it. We could have done that in the Ministers room, by letter or he could have issued a press release, but he chose the method of a statutory instrument. Some members of the Committee may well think that the whole thing is a pretence—a useful form of democracy that will not help us very much. However, the instrument involves some fine-tuning of an Act of Parliament that we feel, on reflection, could be improved. There is nothing wrong with fine-tuning or with improving the statutory instrument; the only snag is that the Government are committed to passing fewer statutory instruments. The Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 encouraged the Government to reduce the number of statutory instruments. During the passage of that Act, we spent 16 hours and 11 minutes on the Floor of the House and 92 hours and 56 minutes in Committee saying that we would reduce the number of statutory instruments. In spite of that, we have passed 7,839 new ones since then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I find the hon. Gentleman's comments diverting, but they are also a diversion from the business before us. I ask him to return to the scope of the statutory instrument that we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I appreciate your comments, Sir Alan, I am arguing that we should not be debating the instrument at all. If we are prevented from saying that, not only can we not debate the statutory instrument but, if we do, it does not matter—it will come into effect in any case. If I am unable to argue that this statutory instrument should not be before us this morning, our proceedings become even more farcical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is your view, Sir Alan, that we cannot even debate whether the statutory instrument should be here because its existence is a fait accompli—to use another French phrase—there is no point in saying anything. I hope, however, that you will allow me to explain why I believe that the statutory instrument is mistaken and why we should not be debating it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are debating a prayer against this specific statutory instrument. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to pursue an argument about statutory instruments in general or, indeed, about the utility of this specific statutory instrument, there are more appropriate occasions than this to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I understand the argument, every time that I stand up to complain that statutory instruments are too numerous, somebody else stands up to tell me that it is the wrong time or place to say so. It is like a Kafkaesque nightmare. I want to debate policy towards statutory instruments, but somebody always stands up and tells me, "You cannot discuss that here". I find myself continually moving around
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
the House, from statutory instrument to statutory instrument, trying to say that we should not be debating them. I am told, "This is the wrong place", but it would be nice if I could be directed to the right place. If I get to the right place, I probably will not get called to speak because there is insufficient time, or the House has risen, or because of the Jopling rules. An Adjournment debate would be fine but I never succeed in obtaining one because so many other hon. Members apply for them. All that I want to say is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is in danger of abusing the procedure of the Committee. If he has a serious point about the role of statutory instruments, there is an appropriate means of making it. The difficulty of gaining immediate access to time on the Floor of the House is one that all hon. Members face. It is certainly not a proper use of this Committee's time to pursue his current line of argument, and I must ask him to debate the substance of the regulations before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not have pursued my discussion but for the fact that I was drawn into it by you, Sir Alan. I shall confine myself to what I was saying before I was diverted from my main intent. I regret the necessity to have to bring the instrument to the Committee and I regret the Minister adding to the number of regulations, which is contrary to the Government's general policy. I recognise, however, that the instrument before us today is aimed at fine tuning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was arguing that there was little point in making a speech because anything that I said would be utterly irrelevant. I can put a question to the Minister downstairs, in the Corridor or in his room. I respect what you, Sir Alan, are saying as Chairman. All that I am saying is that many hon. Members present are engaged in a gloriously irrelevant process. I wanted to put down a marker. I accept that the Minister wants to carry out some fine tuning of social security legislation, but it may be counter-productive. I regret that he feels the need to add yet another statutory instrument to more than 1,000 dealt with in Committee and on the Floor of the House every year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my intervention, I mentioned the case of one of my constituents who received advice from the social security office many years ago. He was ill but was told that he could not claim a specific benefit. He subsequently found that that advice was wrong. He requested a back payment for four years but was told that he could only claim for one year. He then put in his claim for that year but was told that he could not make that claim because he had not shown continuous good cause. I believe that the gap in continuous good cause, from the moment that he discovered that he could claim, was three weeks, although it may have been a month. During that period, one of his parents died. I believe that the adjudication officer ruled that a gap of three or four weeks caused by the death of a parent was insufficient reason to show good cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Withington, I am worried that the regulations are a device to fine-tune and tighten an already fairly tight rule. They differ from
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
many others—it is a matter of fine tuning and does not arise from European legislation—but they are restrictive, inevitable and a fait accompli.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you requested, Sir Alan, I shall refrain from pointing out that this is the one thousand and fifty second such order passed in this Session. I hope that the Minister will think about that and do something about it. I hope that we do not have to see him too often, although I always appreciate it when I do see him. I hope that the Committee will not have to suffer any more speeches such as this, because I hope that the Government will take heed of my warning that this is an order too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.1 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Roger Evans)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that we should have realised that the kind words of my hon. Friend the Member for South Hams (Mr. Steen) would be followed by a whammy, if not a double whammy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are committed to improving the performance and service of the independent tribunal service. These regulations are designed to improve that service for the benefit of the public. The point made by the hon. Member for Withington about giving reasons is not controversial, but we believe that it will speed up a decision about an appeal by about two weeks. As benefit cannot be received pending an appeal decision, that is a small but important step towards providing a better and speedier service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any system of regulation and appeal to tribunals requires an up-to-date and effective scheme of legislation as to how those rights may be exercised. My hon. Friend the Member for South Hams is therefore mistaken: this is not about deregulation but about improving the service to the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All Ministers argue that the orders or regulations that they bring to Committee are not deregulatory but that they are fine tuning or improvements, that they give better value for money or are are good legislative practice. I am like an Agatha Christie, trying to find orders that are deregulatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave my hon. Friend to that hunt, which may be more difficult than he thought. Deregulation is a separate matter: surely it is beyond argument that a proper legislative scheme and framework are necessary for appeals tribunals. Parliament must participate in that decision-making process, of which this order is a part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Withington was worried that the arrangements meant that social security appeals cases were treated less favourably than other cases. The Government reject that claim, which must be put in context. A person who is sacked has three months to bring a complaint to an industrial tribunal, and reasons must be given for lateness. A person who is injured—for example, after exposure to asbestosis—must bring a claim to the Court of Appeal within four weeks or show why it should be later. However, the difference between social security appeals cases and claims for dismissal and for personal injury is that a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
person making a social security appeal can always make a fresh claim. For dismissal or injury, there is one chance: people who lose in the first instance have one chance, within tight limits, to appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In social security, the issue goes further than that. If new evidence can be produced, it is possible to return to the adjudicating officer and to ask for a review. The argument about late appeals is not about preventing people from getting benefit from now on or about getting benefit backdated from today for 12 months, which can be won on a review. The argument is about whether cases older than 12 months can be reopened. The problem has arisen because several welfare rights organisations have conducted a campaign in which they tried to bring appeals out of time. That is having a disruptive effect on the good administration of the appeals system. The regulations aim to bring justice and order in that respect. When one considers them as a whole, the arrangements are not unreasonable compared to other jurisdictions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify two points? Is he saying that social security claimants who fail to receive the benefit to which they are entitled or who have their benefit restricted have the opportunity to make a fresh application? Moreover, is he saying that if that application is successful, because the advice given for the first application which led to the applicant's being denied benefit was different from that given on the second application which provided benefit, there is no prima facie case for saying that the applicant should have been entitled to the benefit from the point of the original claim?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, how many of the cases that the Minister says are being whipped up by welfare rights organisations relate to cases more than six years old?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had the hon. Gentleman waited, I would have dealt with both those points. For people who make a fresh application because past advice was wrong and led to their not receiving benefit, and if the advice was given by the Benefits Agency, that provides a ground for a special payment. If the fresh application succeeds, benefit is received for the future. If a personal injuries or dismissal action is lost on appeal because of being out of time, that constitutes a one-off event; it has happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the circumstances are the same for people who have made a fresh application and been given advice which leads to benefit being received, having previously been denied it because of erroneous advice, against which no appeal can be made? In other words, is he saying that people who have been denied benefit in the past are not entitled to claim for that period through appeal? That is an absurd situation. It denies people the right to a benefit to which they are obviously entitled given that the fresh claim has been successful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not follow at all. If it can be shown that the Benefits Agency has given seriously wrong advice and has made an official error, there is a compensation scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the regulations, the figures are quite damning: in 1995, 10,000 late applications were made. More than half—such is the scale of the problem—were admitted. The really serious indication that the system was not working was that 3,000 of the applications were apparently granted on the basis that chairmen considered there to be special reasons. However, as far as we can trace from the papers, no reason was given—the applications were simply rubber-stamped through the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Difficulties arise with appeals such as, "I appeal against my first award of supplementary benefit or national assistance". Supplementary benefit ceased to exist 10 or more years ago and national assistance ceased in 1966. In 1965, more than 700 applications were more than six years old. The effects of that on the system were very serious. Older appeals clog up the process because it inevitably take tribunals much more than to resolve them as they have to dig through previous history. The Benefits Agency—rightly and reasonably because of the expense involved—does not keep paperwork going back to the 1970s and 1960s. Tribunals have to reconstruct what happened many years ago without the relevant information which results in an unfair process and affects the good order and administration of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is simple. As a result of the large number of late applications and the way in which they were being brought, the decision-making process was being slowed down and other members of the public, who were not receiving benefit pending their appeal decision, were being held up. That is why we have decided that it is right and proper to tighten up the process to prevent this ludicrous situation from occurring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make it clear to the hon. Member for Withington. Under the six-year final rule, if he owed me money or I owed him money, we would have six years in which to bring an action. There must be an ultimate time limit. If people do not bring their appeals in time, they should be subject to some test to avoid every late application merely being rubber-stamped. It is not entirely clear to me why chairmen admitted more than 3,000 late appeals without any apparent reason having been given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proper way to deal with that problem is for Parliament to introduce legislation, although I appreciate the first that, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Hams said, this is not the most opportune forum for criticising this measure in detail. We come to Parliament to be challenged on an instrument that tightens up this process. I accept that this Instrument tightens up the process—it is designed to do so and it should do so, but it does so in a way that is broadly fair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is saying that of the 10,000 late appeals, 700 were more than six years old. So, by his own figures, 9,300 of the 10,000 would have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0526">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
been allowed anyway. That is the scale of the problem that he is addressing through these regulations and it must be put in context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Previously, a fresh claim could be made and could be successful if the initial claim had been unsuccessful because of erroneous information given by staff of the Benefits Agency. It is clear that under these regulations that is not a ground for an appeal. The Minister says that that problem could be dealt with by a compensation scheme. Will the Minister give us details of how that compensation scheme will work and tell us what the mechanism will be for pursuing a claim for compensation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a new scheme. If official error has been shown, the Benefits Agency has, for many years, made back payments to compensate for that error and the consequences that have flowed from it. That is a perfectly ordinary and well-established administrative procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not talking about administrative error or about someone wrongly calculating the benefit. If the advice that the applicant was given was shown to be erroneous because the fresh claim on the same information was granted, will that be a ground for compensation in the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am saying is that if there is an official error and loss can be shown to have flowed from it, compensation will be paid. That has always been the case. That practice may not be entirely related to this matter, but it is well-established and is a proper aspect of modern administrative procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must press the Minister on this point. Will he confirm that such erroneous advice given to an applicant equates to and is on the same terms as administrative error for the calculation of benefits? In future, if such advice is wrong, will that be a ground for compensation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered that question twice already. If erroneous advice is given that amounts to an official error, and if it has been relied upon and loss can be shown to have flowed from it, that is a matter for which, under well-established principles, compensation is payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude my speech by dealing with one or two other matters that were raised specifically. Being in a coma for more than three months or having a very serious illness are perfect illustrations of how the new test would be satisfied. It was not appropriate—despite the advice of the Council on Tribunals—to deal with that by directions from the president of the tribunal, because thoses directions have no binding force and are persuasive only on the individual tribunal chairman. In any event, it is curious to request the Government to proceed in that way. I suggest that it is more appropriate to proceed by statutory instrument So that Parliament can have its say—in so far as Parliament has a say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked complicated questions about how much more or less fair the measure was compared with other jurisdictions. I do not want to have a long argument,
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
but the hon. Member for Withington should beware of general statements in the White Book. The actual practice of the Court of Appeal is quite severe in my personal and professional experience. Whether it is your VAT appeal in 30 days, Sir Alan, or the hon. Gentleman's income tax appeal to be brought within 30 days, for the good administration of most jurisdictions a reasonably short period is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the overwhelming majority of people, three months is a perfectly fair and reasonable period in which to bring an appeal. If one wants to appeal later than that, one must have-a good reason. We have spelt that out in a test that is based on what happens in other jurisdictions. However, because of the difficult history of that particular set of jurisdictions, we have decided that it is necessary to spell that out. I point out to the hon. Member for Withington that we have insisted that reasons be given if an appellant is turned down; we believe that that is an appropriate step.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is an appropriate step—it is obviously helpful for claimants to have the reasons—why does the Minister not allow an appeal against the decision of the chairman of the tribunal through the courts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Interlocutory appeals, which is what they would be, are generally discouraged in all jurisdictions. There simply must be an end to the argument. The point at stake is that the appellant must be given some explanation of why he is not being allowed to proceed out of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One cannot challenge it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can challenge it by judicial review in some circumstances—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]. The hon. Gentleman huffs and puffs, but the point is simple. If the criteria in the regulations are manifestly not safisfied, that is the basis for a judicial review. It is not 100 per cent. tight, and I am not encouraging judicial reviews. It is meant to be a restrictive test, in the interests of stopping litigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that there is a cost-compliance assessment on all statutory instruments. Will the Minister tell us whether there has been a cost-compliance assessment of this statutory instrument? If there has been, will there be any increase in costs? Will more civil servants be employed as a result of it? Why was it necessary to introduce the regulations now? If I understood the figures correctly, we are talking about 700 cases. Why are we bothering to pass another regulation when, taking the cost-compliance assessment into account, it is not worth doing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I firmly reject that point. The regulations will not impose any costs on business and are necessary for a sound administration. I did not weary the Committee with how the situation had worsened over the years, but it has worsened and is continuing to worsen. The regulations will prevent it getting even worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, there is no meeting of minds between the Minister and myself and other members of the Committee on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not go into detail on the subject of statutory instruments, but my advice to the Government would be that they could limit the number of statutory instruments if they used primary legislation more effectively to give details of how legislation will work. That would avoid the endless statutory instruments and the frequent amendments to them, made because the Government have got it wrong at each stage. Paying more care and attention to primary legislation would be a better way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not agree on the regulations and shall have to monitor their impact closely. The Government are using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and many people will be aggrieved. I shall examine carefully whether people who have been denied the right of appeal can use the fresh claims procedure to pursue compensation in many of the areas that the Government have tried to limit in the regulations. Injustices will flow from the regulations and many people will be denied the benefit to which they are entitled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always impressed when Opposition Members talk about close monitoring. It sounds as if there will be teams of people with computers checking the details. How will the Labour party carefully and closely monitor the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. We shall try—this highlights another difficulty with the procedures of the House—to monitor the regulations by asking the Minister parliamentary questions about how the system works in practice, how many appeals are pursued and how many denied. I hope that I shall not receive a stock reply from him and be told that the information is unavailable or available only at disproportionate expense. The Department has a duty to supply such information to people who seek to monitor not only this but a range of other social security legislation. It is important that the Department provides the information that we request so that we can understand these complex matters. We shall examine the operation of the appeals and how many are denied. I am sure that the Minister will co-operate by supplying information through the usual parliamentary channels. We do not support the regulations but, as the hon. Member for South Hams said, they are in place, and I shall not delay the Committee further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
