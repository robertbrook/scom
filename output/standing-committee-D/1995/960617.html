	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. Steve Norris)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Stansted Airport Aircraft Movement Limit (Amendment) Order 1996.</p></blockquote>
Stansted is the United Kingdom and Europe's fastest growing international airport and has been so for the past four years. Forty one scheduled destinations are served by direct flights from Stansted operated by 13 carriers. Air UK, a British airline, is the biggest operator there, with 20 routes, mainly to European destinations. The airport is extremely popular and the new terminal has won more than 25 awards for design, passenger comfort and environmental friendliness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stansted has outline planning permission for about 15 million passengers per annum, but when that permission was given it was decided that development should be phased in line with the rate of growth of demand and the development of the associated infrastructure. The first phase allowed development for up to 8 million passengers per annum—known as mppa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the draft order is approved, it will enable Stansted airport to reach an annual throughput of 8 mppa and thus to realise the full potential of the first phase of development. The order amends the existing Stansted Airport Aircraft Movement Limit Order 1987 by raising the air transport movement—ATM—limit there from 78,000 movements to 120,000 movements per annum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for the order is straightforward. In 1987, the purpose of the ATM limit was to support the planning condition for development of the first phase, up to 8 mppa. The key element in converting passenger throughput into a movements limit was a forecast of how aircraft loadings would develop. The ATM limit of 78,000 was calculated by comparing passenger loading with Gatwick airport and drawing a parallel that might operate at Stansted when that airport was handling 8 million passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The science of aircraft loading is, however, inexact. The limit of 78,000 movements per annum adopted in 1987 assumed average loadings of about 100 passengers per aircraft. In fact, the airlines operating from Stansted use smaller aircraft than anticipated, so the average number of passengers has been rather lower. Current throughput is about 4 million passengers per annum and commercial passenger aircraft movements number just over 57,000. That means that the current ATM limit of 78,000 equates to
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
just over 5 million passengers per annum, which is likely to be reached by 1997. In addition, the number of movements at the airport means that stand space on the existing two satellites will become increasingly congested, and the development of a third satellite will soon be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of those circumstances, the British Airports Authority applied to the Secretary of State for Transport in July 1995 to raise the ATM limit at Stansted from 78,000 to 150,000. The BAA assumed that 150,000 movements would be reached in about 2008, and envisaged that that would be the equivalent of 15,000 mppa. The Secretary of State consulted on that and a lower limit of 120,000 movements per year was agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That lower limit was calculated by adjusting the existing ATM limit upward to take account of the lower than expected average aircraft loading, but retaining the link to 8 million passengers per annum, which was the core of the original agreement. On the basis of the latest information about passenger loading, an ATM limit of 120,000 would enable Stansted to achieve a throughput of 8 million passengers a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A total of 70 responses to the consultation exercise were received from a variety of bodies, including aviation groups, local authorities, district and parish councils and environmental groups. The responses were an important part of the decision-making process, and when all the factors had been carefully considered the Government decided to recommend to the House a revised limit of not 150,000, but 120,000 movements. That limit will meet the concern expressed by local authorities that the development of Stansted should be phased with the development of local infrastructure. It is also consistent with the conclusions of the planning inquiry that the timing of the further development of Stansted should depend on the rate of growth of demand, but it will allow the BAA to continue to develop terminal facilities as business grows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft amending order contains only two articles. The first determines when the order will come into effect, and the second substitutes the figure of 120,000 for the figure of 78,000 in article 2 of the 1987 order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that several members of the Committee participated in the 1987 debate, when the original order was made. I think in particular of my hon. Friend the Member for Saffron Walden (Sir A. Haselhurst), whose constituency interests have led him to take an extremely active part in matters regarding Stansted Airport, and of my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir D. Mitchell), who, as Minister of State at the Department of Transport, led for the Government in that debate—I am delighted that he has found the time to be with us today. On that occasion—a rather late night, as I recall—the House approved the order because it supported the Government's policy of phasing the development of Stansted Airport in line with the growth in demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
That is essentially the issue before us today. The revised limit of 120,000 movements will ensure that future development continues to be phased, but also gives the BAA sufficient assurance to proceed with the necessary investment. On that basis, I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.35 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Alan Haselhurst 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Saffron Walden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order might seem to be the most straightforward of matters. Indeed, as my hon. Friend presented it, people might wonder why so much fuss has been made about it, why the procedure is so complicated and why so much consultation was necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order affects my constituency more than any other, although neighbouring constituencies are affected to some degree. However, it has aroused so much concern because the ATM limit introduced in 1987 was the only protection given to local people. My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire, when he was Minister, said that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"ATM limit could provide an additional means"—</p></blockquote>
additional to the phasing of the airport at 8 million passengers a year—
	<br><blockquote><p>"of regulating airport development, with the object of controlling the impact of that development on local infrastructure."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 28 April 1987; Vol. 115, c. 263.]</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Minister referred to the infrastructure keeping pace with the development of the airport. I suspect that the lively response to the consultation was the result of people's experience over the past nine years, which has caused them to doubt whether the infrastructure has kept pace with the development of the airport. It is hardly surprising that most of the official responses to the consultation suggested that ATMs should be limited to 100,000 a year, and some, including the Council for the Protection of Rural Essex, said that there should be no increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain benefits were supposed to flow from the decision to allow the major development of Stansted. There have been benefits in employment, and many people find it increasingly convenient to travel from Stansted airport. Those factors are on the plus side, but there is a negative side. The understanding, shared by the inspector who chaired the airport inquiry, was that the rail service to the airport would be enhanced. However, apart from the building of a spur into the airport, no increase in capacity on that line has been achieved. Indeed, the north-bound spur was built but the service has now been reduced to one train a week. That is no service at all—it is a ghost train, and known as a parliamentary train.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen no improvement in the rail service; rather, those who commute or use stations from north of the junction into the airport have seen the service to Liverpool Street station deteriorate. The airport train service is fine for air passengers, but it is not much good for those who work at the airport because the trains are fast, stopping at few places. They do not stop at intermediate stations to collect the growing number of the airport's employees. The failure to do that inevitably increases the pressure for more housing to
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
be provided in the immediate environs of the airport. Those of us who value the rural nature of north-west Essex want to resist that pressure. So no promises on the rail service have been delivered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the road improvements, it was understood early on that there should be a trunked and upgraded A120 running eastward from the M11, to the airport, and on to Braintree and the Al2indeed, BAA, the airport operating company, provided resources towards it. BAA has managed to build, at a cost of £436 million, a splendid new airport terminal with all the ancillary facilities, but the first sod has still not been turned on the A120. That is a hopeless mismatch of infrastructure in this major airport development. The fact that that improvement has not taken place is convenient for no one—whether connected to the airport, or trying to live ordinary lives around it. I should like assurances that a continued standstill on the road infrastructure will not accompany the increase in the ceiling on movements at the airport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point I want to mention is BAA's extremely poor performance on compensating people for the loss of value of their properties. There is statutory right to compensation under the Land Compensation Act 1973. Claims are permissible up to 1998, but the way in which they are being dealt with defies all analysis; it is being done in an extremely slow, curmudgeonly way. All those people know that Parliament is considering an increase in the number of flight movements into Stansted, thus further adding to their woes—not that noise disturbance is the key thing in their minds—yet the process of compensation is falling miserably behind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that some pressure will be applied on the airport operator to improve its performance fulfilling its statutory function. Otherwise, it will be unfair for my constituents to see an increase in activity at the airport, but no commensurate increase in the pace at which their compensation is being paid. When one considers that there has been no improvement in the rail or road infrastructures and a niggardly performance on compensation, it is no wonder that there has been resistance to the proposal that the ATM limit should be increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One element of my constituents' suspicion is not perhaps justified and that is the fear that, if the Committee and the other place approve the order, an increase in the limit will automatically produce more business. Of course, there is no direct link between the ceiling on the number of passenger movements and the actual number of passengers who come through the airport doors the following day, week or month. However, the fact that an increase is signalled will inevitably heighten concerns about the additional number of night flights that might be expected. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will recognise the fact that, although fewer people live in the countryside around the airport, the disturbance of night flights is that much greater in the peace of the countryside than elsewhere. We need to be tolerant of the fact that there might be an increase in the number of night flights as a consequence of the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Having relayed those fears to the Committee on behalf of my constituents, I hope that I shall receive a response from the Minister. I am glad that, after consultation, the Government have settled on the lower of the two figures that they proposed as the basis for consultation and that they are demonstrably saying that the order corrects the ATM figure in order to equate with their original commitment to limit the development of the airport to eight million passengers per annum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dare say that my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire and I will exchange the odd wry smile over the debate that took place in the House in 1987. I jousted with him about whether the figure that he put before the House on that occasion was the appropriate one. It is not often that we score a point against a Minister of the Crown, but history shows that it was game, set and match to me on that occasion. It also underlines how cautious we must be when making assumptions about the number of passengers on any particular flight and the number of flights that make up the total throughput of an airport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Experience shows that the figure of 78,000 air movements is inadequate. Although the figure of 120,000 might be frightening to some, it is perfectly justifiable. I justify it simply on the basis that, as far as one can predict, the airport services that will use Stansted in the next few years are unlikely to be much different from those that have been using it since the new terminal opened in 1991. It is perfectly reasonable to predict that the number of passengers per flight will be in the region of 68 to 70. Therefore, to arrive at a figure of about eight million passengers per annum, one must assume that there will be 120,000 flights. Even though a lower figure may be more comforting to my constituents, I do not think that there is a better figure given what we know about the airport's likely development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a topical point, if the alliance proposed yesterday between British Airways and American Airlines is approved by both Governments, it is almost certain to lead to a further concentration of flights at Heathrow. That makes it even less likely that the pattern and type of flights coming to Stansted will alter significantly in the next few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Government have adopted a reasonable position in proposing the figure of 120,000 and I shall give the order my support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.47 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that the House has had an opportunity to discuss aviation matters since the Select Committee on Transport reported on airport capacity and since the important announcement yesterday about the alliance between British Airways and American Airlines. I appreciate that this Committee is not the place to talk about such matters, but I hope that the Minister will use his considerable authority to consider the most appropriate forum in the House to debate them.
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Certainly, we have not had a debate in the past six months on the broader implications of aviation policy—and, perhaps, we should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's debate draws in some of the wider issues, and I shall refer to them in connection with the order. The aircraft movement limit at Stansted cannot be taken in isolation. It is intimately connected with the issue of airport capacity, particularly in the south-east. I take the conclusion of the Select Committee a little further by suggesting that this subject, along with issues such as environmental regulation, service access provision, planning and so on, should be considered by this or the next Government in a White Paper. We should do that rather than make up aviation policy in such a piecemeal fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, the industry needs stability and certainty when it invests large sums of money—for example, £400 million in the development of Stansted. The industry needs a policy framework for aviation, but that has sadly been lacking for some time. I am not on my own in proposing that. The majority of witnesses at the Select Committee also proposed some form of White Paper on airports, especially for the south-east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the major challenges facing the aviation industry is how best to use existing resources given the constraints on airport capacity and the pressure that that generates. The proposal to increase capacity at Stansted is a welcome short-term measure—Labour Members support it— but it does not remove the need for an overall airport and air transport framework. The continued long-term success of UK aviation will depend on a clear sense of direction from the Government about that future development. The Government have failed to deliver on that, but we shall certainly put it right when there is a change of Government, not least by the early publication of a national transport framework, which will set out our objectives in aviation and other areas of transport policy over the next 20 years and over the next five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In agreeing that Stansted should be allowed to develop within its planning approval limit, I ask, before there is a Labour Government to sort the problem out, the Minister to confirm that complementary measures will ensure the best result for the aviation industry, consumers and the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would like to encourage Stansted to develop its long-haul services as much as possible and ease congestion in the south-east—and not merely to provide short-haul services, as it has done so successfully in its local area. That is why BAA invested money and why Stansted was so designed. Stansted is not just a regional airport for the south-east, but part of our international network, and I should like it to be further developed as an effective hub. Its development is to be commended, but it is disappointing that it has not yet helped to resolve the capacity problems that are continually faced by Heathrow and Gatwick, despite technological change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To that end, the Government must get the balance right between competitive and fair and enforceable regulation in the public interest. Competition in the aviation industry is a valuable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
mechanism, but not an end in itself. The British industry developed its strength and diversity under a system of enlightened regulation that gives airlines relative stability, but also allowed them wide commercial freedom. The Select Committee's recommendations that the ownership of BAA—of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted—should be reviewed has received a great deal of press coverage. That reflects a growing concern that the group must constantly ensure that it is compatible with fair competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government might consider examining several areas: first, the regulatory framework; secondly, routes and services within the group; and thirdly, assessing and perhaps tendering new infrastructural projects along strictly public-interest lines. It is also essential that increased competition not lead to any degradation of the very high safety standards that we enjoy in the aviation and airports business in the United Kingdom. All airlines operating to and from U.K. airports should be subjected to full safety controls relating to aircraft maintenance and operation and crew competency. That is one area in which the European Union has a clear locus, and perhaps there will be in coming years a harmonisation of the high standards in aviation safety, to ensure that all aircraft, whether or not registered in the U.K., meet the same safety and operational standards as we have come to expect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Alan Haselhurst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with great interest to what the hon. Gentleman has to say, but I find it difficult to relate it to the order before us. I thought that we had agreed that the order deals purely with the technical point as to whether 78,000, 120,000 or any other figure equates with the established policy, approved by the House, of Stansted being allowed to handle up to eight million passengers per annum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great faith in the Chairman's ability to chair the Committee competently. The hon. Gentleman is not yet a member of the Chairmen's Panel, but his advertisement will have been heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present system of competition and regulation must also be improved internationally to achieve objectives such as reducing fares and widening choice. We need to consider which elements of regulatory pressure will enable the British aviation industry to develop and flourish. Given the development of the third-package regime, those issues must now be pursued at European Union level. A Labour Government would want to play a constructive role within the EU aviation framework, allowing Stansted airport, among others, to attract new services and reap the benefits of competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerning transatlantic services, we in the United Kingdom are well placed to benefit from deals such as the recent one between British Airways and American Airlines, with proper direction from the Government. That should mean adequate safeguards for the user, the British air transport industry as a whole and the British economy. Any negotiations on slots to allow
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
American carriers into our hub network should balance the attractions of Heathrow with the availability of capacity at airports such as Stansted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of surface access, which was raised by the hon. Member for Saffron Walden in the form of the Al20. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about that; it is an essential part of an integrated transport network. I was rather surprised to hear the hon. Gentleman's comment about rail access to Stansted, and will be interested to hear the Minister's reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must work closely with our European partners, the aviation industry and local authorities to develop policies that integrate all modes of transport. As the Select Committee recommended, travel to airports by public transport rather than by private car must be encouraged, so I was disappointed to hear the hon. Gentleman's assessment of how that has not taken place at Stansted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Air transport should be integrated into a national transport strategy by encouraging good-quality rail and bus services from regional centres of population to regional airports, and improving access to Heathrow and Gatwick via links to rail services to the south and west will be important. I commend the work currently being undertaken by BAA, but how much better it would be if the Government were an active partner in that. Nowhere is that more important than at Stansted. If we intend to increase the number of movements, tying that into an integrated transport strategy is important. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman pointed out some of the current deficiencies that need to be put right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The future of aviation development must take account of its impact on the environment and local communities. I hope that the Minister will inform us of the results of consultation on increased movements at Stansted that he has held with local authorities, the Civil Aviation Authority, the Department of the Environment and his Department. I am especially interested in the question of additional night flights and the impact that they will have on local communities. A number of municipal airports around the country have taken great steps to ensure that detrimental environmental effects are limited, and I am especially concerned that extra capacity may mean extra night flights. I hope that the Minister can reassure constituency Members and the rest of the Committee on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also concerned to hear that compensation payments have still not been made in the constituency of the hon. Member for Saffron Walden. I join him in asking the Minister to make clear the Government's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also support the Select Committee's recommendation that the CAA conduct further study into the environmental impact of major airports. We must consider ways of minimising such impact before airports become congested. Stansted is in the fortunate position—although the hon. Gentleman may not agree with that—of being at that stage in its
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
development when such decisions could be taken now, to avoid problems that may occur when the airport becomes congested later in its life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The environmental impact of airport expansion can be further reduced by encouraging the use of cleaner fuel and improved engine design. Perhaps the Minister will take this opportunity to let us know what complementary environmental measures of that nature are being encouraged at Stansted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will respond positively to some of those ideas, and to the comments of the hon. Member for Saffron Walden. If he is not able to do that, I hope that shortly there will be a Government that will respond positively to those suggestions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If members of the Committee consider that I have been tolerant so far in the debate, I must plead guilty. If some members of the Committee think that I have been unduly lenient, I assert my definite innocence. For the sake of the record, I point out that the hon. Member for Saffron Walden is a distinguished member of the Chairmen's Panel. I seek to emulate his standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Peter Fry 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wellingborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to delay the Committee for long. However, it is worth noting that the recent report on London airports by the Select Committee on Transport was the second such report in recent years. I was on the previous Select Committee and was involved in drawing up its report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Saffron Walden on standing up for his constituents and making a relevant point about infrastructure. The figures in the proposal represent the minimum that we can get away with over the next few years. I do not suppose that anyone wants to talk about a massive expansion of any airport so close to a general election. Despite what Opposition spokesmen say, I suspect that any future Labour Government would be careful with the timing of a White Paper on airport policy or airport expansion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years we have boxed ourselves into a corner. There has been a considerable increase in the number of passengers and flights recently because the aviation industry is just coming out of a recession. If the industry continues to increase at its current rate, before too long we shall have to consider further sites in the south-east of England where we can supply extra places for airlines and facilities for passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to wander into that debate. I am merely pointing out that the order represents the minimum step forward. In the medium to longer term, the Government—of whatever party—must grasp that basic issue. One cannot merely rely on regional airports to pick up any increase. People know where they want to fly and are prepared to pay for that. They cannot be forced to go elsewhere. We must be candid about the drawbacks of Stansted. Although it is a first-class airport, I, who live within an hour's drive, can rarely go where I want to from there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
The whole issue is wider than the one we have considered today. It concerns the future of Stansted, but it is tied up above all with Government policy on the amount of infrastructure—roads and rail in particular—which goes with airport development. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge the importance of that relationship. I do not want Stansted to end up with the same infrastructure problems as Gatwick or Heathrow. The motorway from Gatwick was intended to go further in towards central London, but it was stopped. At Heathrow there are arguments about the widening of the M25.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a substantial increase in civil aviation in this country. We must balance the interests of civil aviation with those of the people who live and work near our airports. I support the limited step forward represented by the order, but sooner or later we shall have to tackle the wider problem of coping with growth in the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. I was particularly interested in the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Saffron Walden, but I am sure that the Committee will also have noted what my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Sir P. Fry) said about airport capacity. His comments will have struck a chord with many hon. Members who have studied the issue, not least, I am sure, the hon. Member for Feltham and Heston (Mr. Keen), who has an interest in Heathrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gently advise the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) to avoid any Committee chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Saffron Walden from now on. It pays to be careful when insulting hon. Members from other parties in Committees such as this, particularly if they are likely to remain as Committee Chairmen for a few years, as I suspect my hon. Friend the Member for Saffron Walden will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, North covered a wide range of issues, including matters relating to the Select Committee report and other aviation concerns. I shall mention to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport the hon. Gentleman's view that we should have a debate on aviation policy. Conservative Members would welcome such a debate, during which we should point to BA's extraordinary success as a carrier—the Opposition Chief Whip famously remarked that BA would be a basket case that would embarrass the Government for decades to come. We would also mention the British Airports Authority, which is one of the most notable successes of the privatisation policy. Its privatisation was fiercely opposed by the Opposition in their extraordinary, neanderthal approach to the British economy. Thank goodness that those two companies have been such spectacular successes. If the hon. Member for Nottingham, North wants to debate those matters, I shall urge my right hon. Friend to make prime time available for that debate on as many days of the week as the hon. Gentleman would like.

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Let us return to the substantive issues that were raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Saffron Walden. I do not want to deviate from the order for fear that your tolerance, Mr. Cook, might turn to acerbity, and I do not for one second want to test your extraordinary good humour. Basically, my hon. Friend raised four issues: road, rail, night flights and compensation. With regard to roads, he will know that the public inquiry into the Stansted-to-Braintree scheme for the A120 has just been completed, and that we are waiting for the inspector's report. Public consultation on the slip road scheme for the Al20 and the M11 will begin at the end of this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must draw my hon. Friend's attention to an important point about capacity on the road system. His observations were entirely factually accurate. We have come a long way since the 1987 order, but the scheme has not materialised. The Highways Agency's studies show that the current road network will be able to cope with a passenger throughput of about 11 million passengers per annum, which is the limit of the road's present capacity. Any lower throughput does not place undue strain on the road network. Studies show that only 34 per cent. of traffic that currently uses the M11 and the Al20 at junction 8 is airport generated—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>On resuming—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, Mr. Cook, although a proportion of traffic on the A120 and M11 junction 8 and related parts of the infrastructure is airport generated, it is only some 34 per cent. so capacity still exists to be absorbed before overloading becomes an issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Alan Haselhurst</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend accept that, although he may be correct in terms of road traffic measurement, the argument would not be convincing to those of my constituents who have to wait for 20 or 25 extra minutes in the morning to gain access from the A120 to the M11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what my hon. Friend says. My constituency is not far away from his and I know the junction to which he refers. The British Airports Authority has an opportunity to contribute to the funding of the A120 and M11 slip roads and negotiations are on-going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Public sector funding for road construction is limited and planned expenditure on all schemes must be judged alongside the benefits and costs of other schemes and overall resources. I cannot give my hon. Friend a specific time scale for construction to begin, but we are fully aware of road infrastructure issues and they will be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On rail issues, the skytrain express rail service is a twice-hourly service from Liverpool Street with a journey time of approximately 40 minutes. Many
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
trains stop at Bishops Stortford with connections to the north and at Tottenham Hale for connection with the Underground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A working party consisting of Stansted Airport Ltd, the train operating companies, Railtrack, and Essex and Cambridgeshire county councils is considering the feasibility of resurrecting the link north to Cambridge and beyond, which would obviously be of value. The first phase has been completed and was sufficiently encouraging for the working group to move to the next phase of detailed examination and costing of some of the options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rail operating companies, as my hon. Friend the Member for Saffron Walden knows, are now commercial concerns and they will need to judge the most appropriate response to existing capacity at the airport. It is open to them to introduce faster and more frequent train services. My hon. Friend will accept that as passenger numbers increase so the attractiveness of the rail option and the number of services increases. Such a virtuous circle is especially relevant to public transport usage because frequency adds considerably to attractiveness. However, frequency has to be a function of passenger throughput. When passengers throughput reaches the levels predicted in the order, we can fondly anticipate that the train operators will have matched that with an appropriate number of additional services. The signs are that the new privately owned train operators are extraordinarily keen to exploit new market opportunities. They have the basic passengers service requirements and know their obligations. They want to make their businesses profitable, and the most profitable activity is to use capacity where new markets exist to try to gain additional revenues from the flow of additional passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Saffron Walden raised several issues about the airport, the first of which concerned night flights, which were also mentioned by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North. There is a night flight quota at Stansted, as there is at Heathrow and Gatwick and it is varied for winter and summer. The ATM limit that we are establishing will limit all qualifying movements at the airport. It will in no way undermine the limits imposed by the night flying restrictions. There is some capacity within the night flying limits which has not been taken up and therefore technically could be, but I want to emphasise the point—pertinently made by my hon. Friend—that raising the limit would not affect a single flight. Flights are not generated merely by raising the limit. As my hon. Friend knows, in practice, the volume of night flights flow from the type of business that is being generated by Stansted airport. The limit remains in place and is not affected by the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for land compensation, I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on individual claims. The legal position is clear that it is for BAA to deal with such issues under part I of the Land Compensation Act 1973. I am equally concerned to learn that there has been a delay in settling applicants' claims. I shall pass that information on to my right hon. Friend the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Secretary of State who meets BAA from time to time. I am sure that the Committee sympathises with my hon. Friends constituents. It is important that, where a liability exists in a case such as this, it is adequately and promptly discharged. However, I shall not comment on individual aspects of that because it is very much a commercial matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With your indulgence, Mr. Cook, we have dealt with the four substantive issues raised by my hon. Friend which worry him and his constituents. I underline what he was kind enough to point out. The new limit takes effect as a result of the different background to calculating air transport movements. In other words, capacity per flight is rather less than was originally anticipated in 1987. One of the joys of leaving a
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Department and the House in rapid succession is that one does not have to stand in a Committee several years later and hear a colleague say, "I was right; you were wrong." That fate will not befall me on the basis of any prognosis I may have made this afternoon. I notice that my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire has left the Committee. I judge that to be a prescient move on his behalf. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
