Prisons and Young Offenders Institutions (Scotland) Amendment Rules 1966</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Prisons and Young Offenders Institutions (Scotland) Amendment Rules 1996. (S.I., 1996, No. 32).</p></blockquote>
These important rules make changes to many aspects of the working procedures and practices in Scottish prisons. They include the introduction of random drug testing and alterations to the composition of prison visiting committees.<br><br>
The instrument is subject to the negative resolution procedure and was laid on 15 January 1996. A prayer in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) was tabled on 18 January, as a result of which the House decided on 13 February to refer the instrument to a Standing Committee. The statutory 40-day period for praying expired on 23 February, before a debate in Committee could be held. A motion for revocation, as opposed to annulment, was tabled by the official Opposition on 6 March, demonstrating the extent of concern about the content of the proposed changes.<br><br>
Since the period of annulment has passed, our task is, by argument and any other means that we can muster, to persuade the Government that the rules are so flawed that they should be revoked. I am concerned in particular about the two issues which I have already mentioned—random drug testing and the changes made to the composition of prison visiting committees.<br><br>
I shall illustrate my general observations on the changes to prison visiting committees by reference to the situation in the Borders, on which my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwick (Mr. Kirkwood) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir David Steel) have provided me with information and advice.<br><br>
In the past, the rules governing membership of prison visiting committees allowed visitors to be drawn from the regions in which the principal prisons were located. Members from the Borders were allowed to serve on the visiting committee of Saughton prison in Edinburgh. That enabled Borders visitors to maintain connections with Borders people who were serving prison sentences there. It is well known that anyone sentenced in a Borders court is most likely to serve their term in Saughton.<br><br>
There is abundant evidence that that opportunity was well used to the advantage of prisoners and their families. Several prominent councillors from the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Borders distinguished themselves by the amount of time and energy that they devoted to maintaining a link with those from the Borders who found themselves in Saughton.<br><br>
The Government have announced a change in policy, restricting the membership of prison visiting committees to those from the local authority areas in which a prison is situated. The Saughton prison visitors committee is now to be drawn from Edinburgh district and the region currently known as Lothian—that name is due to change on 1 April. Those in the Borders who have been affected by the change are disappointed. A subsequent change in policy means that, after 1 April, visitors on the committee for Saughton prison will be drawn from east Lothian and west Lothian, but not from the Borders.<br><br>
I have used the link between Saughton and the Borders as an example, but such circumstances may well be repeated in other areas, with equally undesirable results. I therefore ask the Minister to reconsider the restrictive and unhelpful rule changes and to allow links with geographical areas and prisons to be maintained as they have been in the past.<br><br>
I want to address my remarks primarily to the issue of mandatory drug testing. You may remember, Mr. Maxton, that we briefly touched on that matter on 15 January in the Grand Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland intervened on the Secretary of State's speech. It is fair to say that for some of us the right hon. Gentleman's replies were inadequate. Indeed, there was more than a flavour of that most dangerous political motivation that one must be seen to be taking tough action irrespective of the sense of such action. On that basis, the original prayer against the statutory instrument was tabled so that the important change to mandatory drug testing could have proper parliamentary scrutiny.<br><br>
It may help if I briefly outline the legislative history of this matter and how it comes to be before us this morning. Rule 88A makes provision for compulsory testing for controlled drugs. It derives its statutory warrant from section 151(2) of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 which inserts into the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989 new section 41B. The rule
<br><blockquote><p>"requires a prisoner to provide a sample for the purpose of ascertaining whether he has any controlled drug in his body."</p></blockquote>
According to the rule, a sample will usually be a urine sample. But the 1994 Act and the rules curiously provide for what is described as a sample of any other description. That excludes a sample of what is described, rather archly perhaps, as a sample of an intimate nature, which is described in new section 41B(3) as blood, semen, saliva, pubic hair or a swab taken from any orifice. Where urine samples are specified and other samples of an intimate nature are excluded, but a further unspecified sample may be sought, we are entitled to ask the Minister what the other sample is and in what circumstances it may be required from a prisoner.<br><br>
That is not simply a matter of the anxiety of lawyers or Opposition Members of Parliament to expose what they believe may be a lacuna or an unnecessary power in the legislation. Refusal to give a sample may lead to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0475">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
disciplinary proceedings, which is clearly stated in schedule 3. That is of considerable importance to a number of professionals operating within the drug testing field.<br><br>
In a letter dated 14th September 1995, Dr. Bird, Dr. Sheila Gore and a significant number of medical and scientific co-signatories, wrote to the Secretary of State expressing concern about the introduction of mandatory drug testing in Scottish prisons. That letter came from the Centre for HIV Research in West Maines Road, Edinburgh, which is a division of the Medical Research Council, and is therefore written by people with considerable experience with the advantage of detailed information and understanding of what is involved.<br><br>
The distinguished signatories raised several concerns. They referred first to the betrayal of prisoners' trust with regard to previous prison researchers; secondly, to the undermining of previous evidence based policies for prisoners and public health; thirdly, to a compromise of current schemes involving voluntary referral to in-prison agencies for alcohol support and methadone programmes, and, fourthly, to the excessive cost of mandatory drug testing, estimated by some as being twice what is required from an appropriate public health response to an already identified problem of injection drug use in Scottish prisons. Finally, they referred to the compromising of future co-operative participation in monitoring the prevalence of blood-borne viruses and risk behaviours in prisons.<br><br>
The letter is written in robust language and two concluding paragraphs in particular warrant careful consideration by the Committee and the Government. The signatories say:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are concerned that mandatory drug testing significantly compromises the future of the innovative, widely disseminated, successful and public health-orientated research initiatives—in addition to WASH surveillance—"</p></blockquote>
—That is, willing anonymous salivary HIV surveillance—
<br><blockquote><p>"that have been pioneered, and until now acted upon, in the Scottish Prison Service."</p></blockquote>
Essentially, the signatories are saying that there are worthwhile programmes in operation but their anxiety, as those directly concerned with the implementation of the programmes, is that they might be compromised.<br><br>
The letter continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"Considerable hidden costs will be incurred by the mandatory scheme because of disciplinary action that results for inmates who refuse or whose urine tests positive for cannabis let alone for Class A drugs. Mandatory testing diverts scarce resources away from the expansion and evaluation of drug education and rehabilitation initiatives which are so critical for the prevention of further outbreaks of blood-borne virus infection in prisons, and whose effect on recidivism should be formally assessed."</p></blockquote>
That is strong stuff and bears weight because those who signed the letter are distinguished in their field and, undoubtedly, have extensive direct experience of the issues.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
A response to that letter, on behalf of the Scottish Prison Service, was written by Mr. Stewart, who is director of strategy and corporate affairs. Among other things, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Mandatory drug testing will also complement the constructive work that is being done in the context of reduction and detoxification."</p></blockquote>
Significantly, he then goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State agrees that drug misusers need support to enable them to recover from their addiction."</p></blockquote>
As a general statement of policy, I doubt whether any member of the Committee, or even anyone in the country, would argue with that but, in the way in which it is stated, it opens up an interesting issue. If the Secretary of State believes that drug misusers need support to enable them to recover from their addiction, it is essential that the Government spell out in advance what the consequences will be of detecting drug misuse. Will a positive sample lead inevitably to disciplinary action or will it lead to support being given to the prisoner? If support will be given, we should know what the nature of that support will be and what resources will be made available in every Scottish prison for that support to be delivered. Those are fundamental questions which go to the heart of the policy of mandatory drug testing.<br><br>
I have no doubt that the Government will have drawn upon the experience of England and Wales, where there has been mandatory drug testing since February 1995. It does the Government no injustice to say that the introduction of mandatory drug testing in England and Wales was, to use somewhat emotive language, part of the war on drugs. If that was its purpose, however, the experience since February 1995 is inconclusive as to the success of the policy.<br><br>
Initial figures released by the Home Office give cause for some alarm. I shall read out some statistical information for the benefit of the Committee. During the period February to May 1995, 1,089 random tests were carried out in prisons in England and Wales. Of those, 362, or 33.2 per cent., were positive for cannabis, and 44, or 4.1 per cent., were positive for opiates or benzodiazepines. From June to December 1995, 2,282 random tests were carried out. Of those, 663, or 29.1 per cent., were positive for cannabis and 168, or 7.4 per cent., were positive for opiates and benzodiazepines.<br><br>
That analysis suggests that there was a movement away from cannabis and towards opiates and benzodiazepines.<br><br>
That analysis suggests that there was a movement away from cannabis and towards opiates and benzodiazepines. Support for that view can be found in the evidence, no doubt based on experience, that was cited in an article in <i>The Independent</i> on 6 February 1996. The article was written by the crime correspondent of that newspaper and appeared under the headline:
<br><blockquote><p>"Prisoners use heroin to thwart drug tests".</p></blockquote>
That is a rather curious headline, but it is justified by the article. The article stated that the
<br><blockquote><p>"chairman of Dartmoor Board of Visitors said the switch was taking place"—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0476">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
that is, from cannabis to heroin—
<br><blockquote><p>"because traces of cannabis can remain in the bloodstream for up to a month compared to about a day for the harder narcotics. He predicted that the change would lead to more inmates becoming drug addicts."</p></blockquote>
The chairman, whom we can invest, if not with infallibility, at least with the ability to make informed criticism and comment, goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"'It's all because of the introduction of mandatory drugs testing. Inmates know that cannabis lasts about a month in the system. It is no longer flavour of the month because it is so easily detectable.'"</p></blockquote>
The chairman of the Prison Officers Association at Dartmoor, Mr. Horn
<br><blockquote><p>"confirmed there had been a rise in heroin and cocain seizures. `Inmates have said that cannabis lasts longer in the body—they know the score, they are not idiots'".</p></blockquote>
A spokesman for the Prison Service denied that there was any connection between those factors, as might have been expected. Yet that is powerful anecdotal evidence in support and corroboration of the statistical evidence that I have quoted. The article also quoted a spokesman for the national Prison Officers Association, who admitted—in terms that might give the Minister more comfort than they give me—that:
<br><blockquote><p>"it was extremely difficult to be certain about drug trends because of the difficulty of getting reliable evidence.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>But a spokesman said, 'The mandatory testing on its own is not going to improve things without proper after-treatment. It will merely tell us what we already know—that a lot of prisoners take drugs.'"</p></blockquote>
There we have the experience in one of the prisons in England and Wales supporting the statistical trend identified in the Home Office figures. Those matters should give cause for concern before we embark on such a programme of testing in Scotland. There is a possibility that mandatory drug testing will lead prisoners to switch from cannabis, which has a half-life in the body of some 14 days, to heroin, which has a half life of three days, in an effort to avoid detection. Heroin misuse is significant because it raises the attendant problems of shared needles and the possible spread of HIV and hepatitis.<br><br>
I want to ask the Minister today what scientific evaluation will be made of the results of random testing in Scotland if the rules pass into law, what study has been made of the figures from English prisons, and what evaluation has been made of the possibility of prisoners switching from cannabis to class A drugs in the light of the anecdotal evidence from Dartmoor to which I referred? If no such evaluation takes place, we are entitled to raise the possibility that the Government are pursuing a policy for public relations purposes without adequate attention to the effect on prisoners or public health in general.<br><br>
The Secretary of State was challenged on those matters by Doctors Gore and Bird who have been assiduous in putting forward the point of view to which I referred. In their letter of 5 March 1996 he was asked what proposals he had concerning those issues,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
first, for evaluation and, secondly, in relation to the experience in England. As yet, no response has been made to that letter.<br><br>
Mandatory drug testing has an attraction because it fills a gap in people's minds. They tell themselves that something must be done about drug-taking in prisons and derive some comfort from the fact that the regime will be more rigorous with an element of compulsion because they believe that good is bound to flow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Andrew Bowden <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brighton, Kemptown)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. and learned Gentleman and have learnt a lot, but if the mandatory power is in the hands of the prison authorities and they wish to test someone, for whatever reason, perhaps because they believe that he is a serious drug addict, they can compel him to take a test. If that power did not exist, would there be nothing to compel that person to take the test? Would it be for the Prison Service to decide how such a test is used?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite right. If there is no mandatory power, there is no compulsion. The point of Drs. Bird and Gore is that there has been much success with a voluntary system, and those who are concerned with the issue of HIV have achieved remarkable success by creating an atmosphere of confidence in which both doctors and prisoners can rely on each other.<br><br>
I thought for a moment that the hon. Gentleman was going to argue that the mere existence of the power might operate as a deterrent. There is not much evidence of that and I am one of those who, based on my professional experience, some of which involved prosecution in the High Court in Scotland, believe that the deterrence of punishment is rarely as effective as the deterrence of apprehension and conviction. It is a remote possibility that the threat of disciplinary consequences for drug addicts in prisons if they are found to have ingested drugs following a mandatory test will stop them doing so again. If that were so, we would see some evidence of that outside prisons. We impose higher sentences in Scotland for possession and possession with intent to supply than in the rest of the United Kingdom and much higher sentences than in many other parts of Europe, but the incidence of drug taking does not appear to have been favourably affected by such a policy.<br><br>
The prison visiting committees, to which I referred rather briefly, and, perhaps more significantly, the question of mandatory drug testing, should be discussed widely by the Committee. We deserve to have a clearer account of the Government's policies towards those two matters than we have been given so far.</span></p>
<p>10.54 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell) on the way in which he moved the statutory instrument. This is an unsatisfactory way of changing the working practices and procedures in prisons.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0477">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
I sat recently on the Committee that considered the Licensing (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill. That Committee took evidence about raves in Scotland. As a result of those representations and the co-operation of the Minister of State, Scottish Office, we were able to modify that three-clause Bill. One new clause of the three that we had tabled was adopted. The original drafting of the Bill suggests how out of touch the Government, and perhaps Parliament, were. When representations were heard about the Bill the Government agreed to modify it, on which I congratulate them. The statutory instrument contains rules and regulations that will interfere in many ways with the workings of the prison system, but we have been given only an hour and a half to discuss them.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Sir A. Bowden) mentioned mandatory drug testing. During the passage of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1984 the Opposition moved an amendment that would require a governor who applied for judicial sanction to authorise a drug test, but the Government rejected the amendment. My experience, and, I am sure, that of many other members of the Committee, from visiting prisons and talking to governors is that the prison system can work only with co-operation and when incentives are provided. Co-operation should be at the heart of the matter. Mandatory drug testing is a serious matter, and the Government may apply for the relevant judicial sanctions. We will consider supporting them in that regard.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East discussed restrictive and unhelpful rules. A cursory reading of the statutory instrument suggests that the rules are innocuous, but the background against which they will be implemented needs to be considered. I do not want to make simple, categorical points but I must say that when the present Secretary of State for Scotland was appointed he dramatically changed procedures by departing from the practices of previous Secretaries of State.<br><br>
I remember sitting in this very Committee Room in 1992 debating the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Bill. On that occasion the Minister said that the Kincraig committee had considered the question of parole in Scotland and he suggested making parole available to short-term and long-term prisoners. He asked for our consent on that matter, which we freely gave. However, earlier this year, the Secretary of State saw fit to dump those proposals and to contradict the practices of previous Secretaries of State and what the Minister had said during the passage of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Bill. Instead, he introduced a consultation paper, "Making the Punishment Fit the Crime", which proposed the abolition of parole. <i>Hansard</i> shows what the Minister said in 1992. The Secretary of State's action totally contradicts previous developments in the prison system. The Opposition supported the 1992 proposals because there was consensus on our approach to the prison system.<br><br>
No political party has all the answers. The Secretary of State says that prison works. We know from monthly visits that prisons do not work. If they did, the

Government's policies would result in fewer people in them, but ever more people are going to prison. Prison obviously does not work. When the Secretary of State produced "Making the Punishment Fit the Crime", I asked what consultation he had undertaken. The resounding answer was that there had been no consultation. That is the most deeply worrying aspect of the issue.<br><br>
I shall not go over the pertinent material produced by the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East, but rather consider the Government's proposals to make the punishment fit the crime. They intend to abolish parole. That will leave prisoners with no incentive. A contemporary consideration of drug testing in our prisons compared with practices elsewhere shows that incentives are necessary. Her Majesty's chief inspector of prisons for Scotland made that point to me. In Canada, prisoners who co-operate freely are offered incentives. Some Canadian prisons offer conjugal visits. We are not proposing going that far, but the present system takes that right away. Rule 88A, to which the hon. and learned Gentleman referred, introduces sanctions for a refusal to provide a sample, but with parole taken away, no incentives are left for prisoners. The mandatory drug testing regime makes chaos in prisons more likely, whereas there is relative tranquillity at the moment.<br><br>
We should not ignore the comments of Dr. Sheila Gore and others at the Medical Research Council, who have written to us on the issue during the past few months. Their aim is to reduce drug taking by people in prison and to make prison regimes more tranquil. I am keen that the Minister should tell us what advice he has taken. If we do not follow good advice, we will have very disturbed prison regimes.<br><br>
Cost is central to the issue. The proper introduction of mandatory drug testing will increase costs. How does that square with recent reductions in public expenditure and the recent comments of the chief executive of the Scottish Prison Service? There is a danger that there will be minimal education and counselling to help people away from drug taking. The Secretary of State is giving us nothing more than rhetoric, doing an injustice to prison officers and governors who are trying to operate regimes conducive to good behaviour and fulfilment.<br><br>
The diversion of scarce resources is an important issue. The Secretary of State has said that he is keen on private prisons. He told members of the Scottish Prison Officers Association that he would consider them for the management of such prisons. God only knows how that fits with the private finance initiative. I have tabled some parliamentary questions on that state of affairs, which proves that the Secretary of State has no coherent programme on mandatory drug testing.<br><br>
The Opposition will not vote against the rules because there is no sense in doing so after such a short debate. We need a longer debate in order to consider all the issues. However, I plead with the Minister, for goodness sake, to consult governors and prisoner officers and then tell the House what progress has been made. The comments of the Medical Research Council
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0478">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
were made in good faith by experienced people. It is sad that they are not being taken up. While the new rules seem inocuous, I fear that, if the Government jettison the previous approach whereby the Opposition and other parties were consulted, a worse prison regime will result.<br><br>
Finally, I ask the Minister for clarification. Section 153 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 amends section 41 of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989 by outlawing the bringing into prisons of any drugs?, firearms, offensive weapons or knives and providing the appropriate powers of search for prison officers when seeking such items. Will the Minister give an assurance that the prohibited articles in new rule 86(4) correspond to those listed in section 153(2) of the 1994 Act?</span></p>
<p>11.6 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. As hon. Members concentrated their remarks on visiting committees and mandatory drug testing, I shall address those subjects.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), raised the issue of early release. That has nothing to do with the rules before the Committee. We are consulting on the proposals, and the outcomes will be laid before Ministers shortly for consideration. It is too early to say what the consultation exercise will reveal, but it has been extensive and it is certain that we will come back to the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although the proposals are not directly relevant, does the Minister agree that prison regimes have to be co-operative and harmonious? If there are no incentives for prisoners, problems occur. The need for mandatory drug testing and incentives for prisoners is important. Does the Minister agree?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important to establish a form of mandatory drug testing that will work effectively, and to be aware of potential problems and different circumstances.<br><br>
Many points have been raised, and I shall address the subject of mandatory drug testing first. The hon. Member for Dumbarton raised the question of support programmes. Such programmes are very important, and I have seen one in progress at Saughton prison which was extremely effective. The appropriate support programmes will be put in place once the scheme is up and running throughout the Scottish prison estate.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North East raised the Bird and Gore concerns with regard to research. I confirm that the costs of mandatory drug testing are currently being assessed. There has not yet been any indication of loss of prisoners' co-operation. The results are to be assessed systematically with the overall target of reducing the prevalence of positive tests. The operations meeting is taking place weekly, and is monitoring the results. The meeting is chaired by the chief executive of the Scottish Prison Service.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
Rehabilitation is extremely important and will go ahead. Increased emphasis will be placed on support programmes. On its own, mandatory drug testing cannot solve the problems associated with drugs in prisons, but it can contribute to the overall objective of reducing drug misuse as part of the Scottish Prison Service's wider drugs strategy. Mandatory drug testing in Scotland is to be introduced on a phased basis when establishments have appropriate support programmes in place to assist prisoners with drug problems.<br><br>
The first phase of testing has already begun in Edinburgh and Cornton Vale prisons. Edinburgh was chosen because it is best placed to provide support to drug-misusing prisoners—it has the longest established drug-reduction programme. Cornton Vale has a full-time addiction worker, and a formal drug-reduction programme is about to begin to supplement existing treatment provided to prisoners with drug problems.<br><br>
Drug testing will send a clear message to all prisoners that if they misuse drugs, the likelihood of that being detected will be much greater. An increased possibility of detection will help prisoners to resist the peer pressure often placed on them to become involved in drugs. Mandatory drug testing will help to identify all those prisoners who may need assistance to combat their drug problems, and appropriate support will be offered to individual prisoners. It will provide accurate and objective information on the scale and the trends of drug misuse, allowing prisons to manage and target more effectively their resources for tackling drug problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that in Cornton Vale someone has been appointed specifically to deal with addiction. Are there similar appointments in all other Scottish prisons, or is it an advantage enjoyed only by Cornton Vale?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So far, there is a full-time addiction worker only in Cornton Vale. Saughton has an extremely good medical unit which gives the best possible advice to prisoners who were on drugs before entering prison and who have a problem while there.<br><br>
All categories of prisoners are liable to be tested. Some 10 per cent. of prisoners will be chosen by a computer on a random basis. If a prisoner tests positive, he or she will be charged with a breach of discipline under the prison rules and could be liable to the usual range of disciplinary action in prison, including an award of additional days, loss of privileges and loss of earnings. He or she will be offered assistance to refrain from drug misuse which might range from provision of information to a place on a drug-reduction programme, depending on the needs of the individual. If a prisoner refuses to provide a sample, the amendments to the prison rules make that a disciplinary offence.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East raised the issue of what drugs should be included. A wide range of illegal drugs, including cannabis, will be covered and the list will be reviewed periodically. The move towards more sophisticated drugs is based on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0479">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
early data from the English Prison Service. It appears that such drugs are present in urine for a shorter time. In the long term, we believe that mandatory drug testing will help eradicate drugs in prisons.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned samples. Those are analysed by an independent laboratory. If a prisoner disputes the result of a screening test, the sample will be given a confirmation test using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. I have no doubt that the hon. and learned Gentleman will be an expert on such matters having dealt with them in court. Studies are taking place to determine whether that will be more reliable than urine, but as yet no firm conclusion has been reached.<br><br>
I do not regard mandatory drug testing as a betrayal of prisoners' trust. All research on drugs in prisons was conducted anonymously and no prisoner was or will be targeted because of it. Mandatory drug testing will complement the Scottish Prison Service's challenge to drugs. Drug-reduction programmes are being steadily expanded, not reduced.<br><br>
We have general measures to stop drugs getting into prison, including closed circuit television, surveillance of visits, searching, use of sniffer dogs and close, regular liaison with the police and other agencies. As for medical treatment, when a prisoner on a methadone maintenance programme is received into a prison on a short sentence or on remand, the prison medical officer, in consultation with the prisoner and the doctor responsible for prescribing for the prisoner when he was in the community, considers whether such a programme should continue. All prisoners receive a comprehensive information and training programme on HIV and AIDS within two weeks of admission. A refreshing reality is that the number suffering from AIDS, certainly in Saughton prison which had a high incidence of AIDS cases, has decreased. We shall make an assessment of the scheme and are considering how best to publish the results.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East referred, on behalf of his hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, to visiting committees. There has been consultation on the matter. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities accepted the change in the rules, as did the Association of Visiting Committees for Scottish Penal Establishments, because in the past many of those on visiting committees did not attend, the committees were large and unwieldy and a change was called for. Scottish Borders is the only council to have made representations. Someone from the region currently chairs the Edinburgh visiting committee and because one third of the membership must come from outwith the elected membership, it will be open to Scottish Borders to operate services again when prison visiting committees are reconstituted under the amendment rules. It was generally considered that the change in the rules concerning visiting committees should go ahead.<br><br>
I recommend the rules to the Committee. There are many of them but hon. Members have not raised many points and I need not weary the Committee with details that are non-contentious and simply bring the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
rules up to date. We have discussed mandatory drug testing, but I should also mention that there is a new complaints procedure. The 1994 complaints system provides, as foreseen in the justice charter, for an independent element through the creation of a Scottish prisons complaints administrator. I instituted a survey of prisoners for the first time in Britain. It was a successful project and a thorough analysis was made of the points raised by prisoners. One was that they wanted better circumstances for family visits and we considered what could usefully be done to satisfy prisoners without infringing discipline and order in prisons and to create a better working relationship between prisoners and prison officers.<br><br>
The Scottish prisons complaints commissioner will be involved in internal procedures following referral to the Scottish Prison Service headquarters. Internal procedures and referrals must take place before the commissioner becomes involved. In the past that proved lengthy and unwieldy and the headquarters stage has now been removed from the complaints process. Once prisoners have exhausted the available internal avenues in the prison concerned, they can make their complaints direct to the complaints commissioner. Similarly, if they have complaints about orderly room decisions, they no longer need to make those to the Scottish Prison Service headquarters before approaching the commissioner. The commissioner will deal with them and make his recommendations to the chief executive. Nothing in that change should give hon. Members cause for concern. Prisoners will have swifter resolution of their complaints and improvement in their situation.<br><br>
The other significant policy changes include temporary release with home leave to help to smooth reintegration into family life. That will be subject to strict criteria and must be earned by good behaviour. Other changes are so relatively minor that I need not go into detail.<br><br>
I have covered the main issues raised by hon. Members. We shall monitor the situation closely in relation to mandatory drug testing, but there have been serious criticisms that far too many drugs have been getting into prisons and we felt it necessary to act in the public interest.</span></p>
<p>11.18 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that last point, there is no dispute that there are too many drugs in prisons and there is no dispute that it is essential to introduce measures outside prisons and in the management of prisons to reduce as far as possible the incidence of drug taking. The dispute between the Government and this side of the Committee concerns the effectiveness of mandatory drug testing. I would not wish it to be thought that there was any slackening of resolve on the part of the official Opposition or the Liberal Democrats in trying to reduce the incidence of drug taking. I hope that that will be clearly understood by the Government.<br><br>
It is pretty clear that, notwithstanding the reservations expressed by those with considerable expertise on the subject—I do not mean the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0480">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
Member for Dumbarton and myself but those people to whose professional qualifications and experience I have previously referred—the Government intend to press ahead. That is their right, and the Government's majority just about allows them to do that, but there will be no excuse if, in five or six years' time, it is demonstrated that the proposals were flawed in conception and inadequate in execution. Whether in Government or in Opposition—it is more likely to be the latter—those who introduced the proposals will have to bear that responsibility at some future date.<br><br>
The Minister's contribution was notable for its failure to suggest that any additional resources would be made available for any additional practices and procedures, apart from mandatory drug testing, that may become necessary. He spoke about there being no loss of prisoners' co-operation. That is hardly surprising as mandatory drug testing has not yet been introduced. We shall wait to see whether prisoners continue voluntarily to co-operate once the system is in place. The Minister also said that the scheme would be introduced on a phased basis. That gives the Government an opportunity that they should take up. If it is to be introduced on a phased basis, why not have a trial? Why not say that the procedures will not be implemented throughout Scotland until they have been applied in one prison in particular circumstances, from which lessons can be learnt and information acquired?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that testing has begun in the prisons that I mentioned and, with regard to resources, is he aware that governors are currently being required to assess the costs, which are being considered? Of course, the necessary expenditure will be provided.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If testing has begun but governors are only now being asked to assess the cost, that is certainly a case of putting the cart before the horse. I suppose the fact that testing has begun reflects the fact that procedures in the House of Commons were inadequate to enable us to deal with the matter in advance. That raises more than one civil liberty issue, although this may not be the time to go into that. It seems pretty curious that we are debating an order, which the Committee might not approve, yet one of the most significant features of the new rules is already being implemented. That issue will repay being revisited on some other occasion.<br><br>
More significantly, the governors' assessment of the costs may be that they will raise a substantial obligation on the budgets for which they are responsible. Will the Minister give an undertaking that that money will be provided as additional money within the governors' budgets and will not need to be taken from other parts of their budgets for the prisons for which they are responsible?<br><br>
The only thing better than having a full-time addiction worker at Cornton Vale would be to have a full-time addiction worker in every prison in Scotland. The problem of drugs is not confined to Cornton Vale
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
and Saughton. Anyone with any knowledge of the management regime and way of life in prison knows that drugs are a problem in every prison. Indeed, if it were not, there would be no justification for introducing mandatory drug testing.<br><br>
Finally, on the matter of visiting committees, the Government have behaved in an unnecessary dog-in-the-manger way. They have managed to alienate Borders regional council, not by refusing to give it money or recognise it, but by denying to members of Borders regional council the opportunity to be part of prison visiting committees. Those people offered their services in the interests of the public good, but the Government said to them, "Very sorry, but you cannot be part of the prison visiting committees of Scotland unless the Committee decides that someone from the Borders should be on that Committee". If I may say so, Mr. Maxton, that is pretty inept of the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and learned Gentleman aware that representatives from the Borders may continue to serve? A proportion of the committee's members are chosen from outwith the area concerned. The present member from the Borders chairs the prison visiting committee. I have no doubt that all volunteers who are proposed will be considered objectively at the appropriate time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of that. However, a consequence of the Government's approach is that the Borders regional council has been discriminated against and that people have been prevented from serving on the committee as of right. That involves unnecessary alienation. For heaven's sake, it is hard enough to find people in this country who are willing to volunteer for public service. The people involved want to take on an obligation but they have had their offer thrown back in their faces.<br><br>
If the rules are accepted, the world will not come to an end, the Prison Service will not crumble into dust and Saughton prison will no doubt go on receiving prisoners. However, the fact of the matter is that people in the Borders region who are particularly interested in these matters feel thwarted and frustrated by the Government. That is, of course, a matter for the Government, not for me.</span></p>
<p>11.26 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to supplement the comments of the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East. Before the autumn I hope to visit half a dozen prisons. The developments that I have seen in prisons are very good. For example, several months ago I was in Peterhead prison and spent an afternoon with the sex offenders re-training programme. Excellent work was being done in that prison.<br><br>
This morning's debate has made it clear that the Government cannot issue their policies from on high, written on tablets of stone. They must understand what is going on in prisons. Our plea is for the Government to report back to us about mandatory drug testing, and any trials that are undertaken, which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0481">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
will allow us to monitor the situation. It may be worth repeating that our, and the Government's, aims relating to prison regimes are the same.<br><br>
I was interested to learn that there is a full-time addiction worker in Cornton Vale prison. I hope that fewer women prisoners will be held there. After the suicide that occurred several months ago, I visited the prison and found that several women prisoners were under what I think is called triple S—strict suicide supervison. I asked one of those women why she was in prison and she replied, "For breaching the Bail Act". I said, "You must have been in prison for committing an offence". It turned out that she had stolen a £40 jumper from Marks and Spencer and had breached bail regulations. I shall not discuss that example further, except to say that such people should not be in institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful illustration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McFall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it is helpful. We should not leave the Committee this morning without the clear impression that the majority of people who are in prison are young. If we are to reduce crime, we must take into account the social and economic circumstances of young people so that they do not end
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
up in young offencers institutions. One of the most heartbreaking experiences that I have had was when I visited the young lifers in Dumfries young offenders institution and realised that nothing could be done for them. When I asked a lawyer friend of mine why young offenders ended up in prison, he said, "They range in age between 16 and 25, but they grow out of offending". "What do you mean by that"? I asked. "Well," he said, "they meet a woman or change their lifestyle."<br><br>
I hope that the statutory instrument will ensure that the lifestyle of young offenders changes and that the young do not end up in prison. All members of the Committee share that aim. We support the Government in that regard. We should continue to work on such a co-operative basis; we should not disagree just for the sake of ideology.</span></p>
