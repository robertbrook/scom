	<p>[MR. FRANK COOK 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Regulations 1995</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995, No. 2869).</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) (Fees) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995, No. 3000).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make no apology for my intention to make a lengthy speech on this important matter. The statutory instruments are part of the Government's deregulation initiative, which is designed to end the need to renew heavy goods vehicle operators' licences every five years. Whether the overarching consideration within which the statutory instruments are framed is valid may be the subject of later discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made a positive response to Brake. I was present with Brake representatives at a meeting when the Minister was attentive, helpful and listened to the group's concerns. I hope that he will be equally positive today. If he is unable to be helpful in the Committee, perhaps he will respond in writing to the points that Labour and, perhaps, Conservative Members raise. I understand that the Government Whip is traditionally unable to say anything on such occasions, but I pay tribute to the hon. Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) for his stout support of the BRAKE campaign. I know that the group appreciates that support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should declare an interest. My constituency is sponsored by the Transport and General Workers Union, although I have had no contact with it on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it clear that the Opposition support the vast majority of people in the heavy goods vehicle industry—they are conscientious, hardworking and reputable. It is in their interests that we highlight the problems in the industry, which are exemplified by the statutory instrument and which are entirely brought about by the cowboy operators who force their drivers to work overlong hours, often with poorly maintained vehicles, tamper with tachographs to hide those facts and fail to run operating centres adequately. Those cowboys are damaging the industry but, sadly, they are not dealt with in the statutory instrument. Those operators—both licensed and unlicensed—from Britain and the rest of Europe are putting innocent lives at risk. In addition, they often make local people's lives a misery by running their operating centres badly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed changes to regulations are not acceptable without a commitment from the Government—which I hope the Minister can give today —to clamp down on
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
those cowboy operators. Indeed, the statutory instrument reveals the wrongheaded approach of the Conservative party in general. I will not go into that in any detail; I shall try, as far as possible, to preserve the cross-party atmosphere on a matter, that is important to so many victims and their families. However, I am sure that my hon. Friends will draw attention to the constant seeking after deregulation in an area of public safety, even if I, in my search for agreement, do not emphasise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes proposed in the statutory instrument include a change to the rules so that partnerships can hold operators' licences. That is welcome, but I am not convinced that those who are responsible for cowboy practices, whether an individual or partners, will be brought to book because the Government are failing to strengthen enforcement and penalties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jean Corston 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise first, for being late, and secondly, for leaving soon because I am serving on a Select Committee which will sit shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my hon. Friend agree that we should congratulate Brake, which has campaigned on HGV safety? Its meetings held in the House under the chairmanship of our hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mrs. Dunwoody) have given powerful testimony of the inadequacies of current remedies to deal with cowboy operators. I have in mind especially the accident at Sowerby and the terrible effect it had on families. I wish Brake more power to its elbow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to put on record again our deep appreciation of Brake's work. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Ms Corston) and, no doubt, other hon. Members—I have already mentioned the hon. Member for West Derbyshire—are active members of Brake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Carlisle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point or order, Mr. Cook. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman might inform us exactly what Brake is and what it stands for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather surprised that an hon. Member would come to the Committee to discuss HGV regulation without being aware of Brake. I am glad that the Minister, through the Whip, is now briefing the hon. Gentleman. Brake has campaigned with the support of all parties, organisations within the motor trade and the roads industry to ensure higher safety standards for HGVs. I am sure that it would be pleased to continue the hon. Gentleman's education by sending him literature, which I advise him to read closely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does Brake stand for?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to explain the ins and outs of a motor engine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am all in favour of a little laissez-faire in the Committee and I do not mind inquiries about acronyms, but I would hate things to become acrimonious. Please desist and allow progress to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Part II of the statutory instrument refers to procedural irregularities. We support traffic commissioners being given the opportunity to review a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0188">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
decision to grant a licence because of procedural irregularities—for example, if the police passed on damning evidence about an applicant that was then wrongly filed. That is a welcome change and I congratulate the Minister for introducing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later, in my speech, I shall press the Minister about when the Government will provide an effective computer network, as recommended by the Curtis report, which would remove any chance of a communication breakdown. Having spoken to him on the matter, I know that he is concerned about it. The sooner we have that computer network the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are my general points. It is important that, in what outsiders may see as the rarefied atmosphere of the Committee, we do not get lost in the detail. We must consider the human cost of the statutory instrument. I shall put forward a worst-case scenario. Let us say that an innocent person has been killed by a large goods vehicle that ran out of control down a hill due to ineffective breaks. It is discovered that the haulier has a history of dangerous lack of maintenance and other illegalities stretching back several years, yet the licensing authority has allowed the operator to continue. The cost is a life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be thought that justice will be done, but although the Department of Transport vehicle examiners have proved that his badly maintained vehicle was responsible for the crash, it takes almost three years before the haulier is proved guilty in court. Even when he is charged on a range of courts, including defective brakes and steering, it is the victim who has to inform the licensing authority because there is no effective official communication channel between the courts and the traffic area officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the victim's representations, the licensing authority takes the haulier to court. The licensing authority listens to the haulier's argument that
	<br><blockquote><p>"he was short staffed due to illness"</p></blockquote>
and decides that he is still of good repute and can keep his licence. Four years after the fatal crash, the Department of Transport discover that the vehicle examiners have imposed defect notices on his vehicles, but the haulier is still granted a licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thank God that that is fantasy and could not happen—or could it? I am sorry to inform the Committee that that was not a fictional story. It is the all too sad but true story of Sue Williams, a 52-year-old physics lecturer who was killed in a crash in 1992 by a lorry owned by the haulage firm Herbert Pheasey. The latest incident in the saga happened in November 1995. It was not until this afternoon that I realised that Mrs. Williams' daughter is Mary Williams, whom the Minister knows well and who has campaigned tirelessly through her work with Brake, to end these tragedies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is just one example of the tragic flaws in the system. I hope that the Minister will not dismiss it as a one-off or claim that the system generally is working effectively. There are all too many such incidents and the system needs to be re-examined so that we can catch the problems before they cause fatalities on the roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning we met the parents of Charles Mitchell, aged 20, who was killed by a lorry last year on the A1 near Newark. The driver is being tried on 5 February at
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Nottingham crown court on a charge of causing death by dangerous driving, so I shall not refer to that case in any more detail. This morning his parents, who are still grieving for their son, asked us to use this debate today to bring to the Minister's attention the need for tougher enforcement and penalties for operators who put lives at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) will wish to catch your eye, Mr. Cook, to talk about the Sowerby Bridge tragedy in Yorkshire. I shall content myself with saying that six people were killed by a truck with defective brakes. A battle is still going on in the High Court to bring about a judicial review of the Crown Prosecution Service's decision not to bring a charge of manslaughter against the company. The penalties in part VII of the statutory instrument will not help that at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The company's only penalty so far has been a £5,000 fine. Six people died that day. I leave hon. Members to draw their own conclusions about whether their lives are worth less than £1,000 each. Sadly, the incompetence of the CPS resulted in a wrongly worded summons being sent to the operator by name, rather than the company. By the time that the trivial mistake had been spotted, it was too late to reword the summons and charges could not be pressed. I hope that the Minister will join us in asking the Attorney-General to expedite the case and let the victims' families finally draw a line under that tragedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, part II.6 of the statutory instrument shows that it is not only a case of people who could well be guilty of manslaughter getting off with a trivial charge. When an HGV driver ploughed into the back of Tom Cowan's car in Nottingham, killing him—leaving behind his wife and three children—the driver was fined £400 for careless driving. We should compare that with what happened in the case of the fishing vessel Pescadoro, about which we have all probably read in the newspapers. That vessel was raised from the sea bed some years after it had sunk. The courts had no compunction about preferring charges of manslaughter against its owners, who had sent it out to sea in an unfit, unseaworthy condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same should be able to happen to the case of heavy goods vehicles, but at the moment people can avoid serious charges. The statutory instrument does not address the matter in any shape or form. That is a great omission and needs to be put right as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have cited just a few cases to illustrate the inadequacy of various parts of the order. I hope that the Minister, who has been extremely generous with his time on such matters, will use his remaining months in office—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."]—I mean that seriously and do not say it simply to make a point. I hope that he will use his remaining time in office, however long that may be, to leave as an obituary or monument to himself some serious changes in the regulations on heavy goods vehicles, even if he cannot do that today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence reveals that a massive 24 per cent.—almost a quarter—of all heavy goods vehicle crashes involve unlicensed vehicles. We estimate that 4 to 9 per cent. of vehicles are unlicensed, so that tiny minority are responsible for a disproportionately high number of accidents. I am afraid that that illustrates again the inadequacies of the order, in which the stipulated penalties are so feeble that they can act as no disincentive whatever to HGV operators who operate without a licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Parliament, whether through the present Government or through an incoming Labour Government, must act to end the shambles by introducing the power to impound unlicensed operators' vehicles. Nowhere in the order is that question addressed. I know that the Minister has some sympathy with that view, which we have put to him regularly. I hope that he will say something today that will ensure that, in extreme cases when people are driving HGVs without a licence, the ultimate sanction will be the impounding and possibly the sale of the vehicles involved. They are unlicensed lethal weapons on our roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The licensing authorities referred to in the order do not currently have sufficient powers to put cowboy operators out of business. According to Brake, many licensing authorities admit that they would rather not revoke a dangerous operator's licence because he may simply choose to run HGVs outside the system. Impounding would stop that problem and provide a real deterrent to those who operate without a licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been in touch with the industry, which also says that such people should be put out of business. The tiny minority who operate in that way undercut the great majority of good operators. They can undercut them on price because they send vehicles out with bad maintenance. They have bad garaging facilities and they pay low wages. They are the enemy of good practice, both from the drivers' point of view and from that of the responsible owners and operators who play such a vital part in our economic life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not bring a partisan message to the debate between labour and bosses or Conservative and Labour. The Curtis report, published in June 1995, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One of the reasons why Commissioners are not tougher in the exercise of their disciplinary powers, and do not command greater public confidence, is that it is felt too easy for an operator to run vehicles illegally, that is without an operator's licence … More must be done to ensure that the potential penalties, particularly where businesses have already been convicted of illegal operation, or banned from operating by a court of Traffic Commissioner, are such as to be a real deterrent."</p></blockquote>
More recently, the Secretary of State for the Environment's United Kingdom round table on sustainable development—another highly authoritative source—also supported those calls, pointedly suggesting that there was a need for tougher and better enforcement. Its report on freight transport states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We agree with the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution that the seeking out and prosecuting of those who operate unlicensed vehicles, and the impounding of vehicles where necessary, would be likely to reduce offences in all categories, since it is usually those who are operating illegally who are contravening other regulations, for example on vehicle maintenance, roadworthiness and overloading. The targeting of illegal operators would be much more effective if backed up by the power to impound, and if necessary dispose of, illegal vehicles."</p></blockquote>
That is the view of the United Kingdom round table on sustainable development, courtesy of the Secretary of State for the Environment. I call him as a witness in my case for having the power to impound heavy goods vehicles that are not licensed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows, the freight industry's representative body, the Freight Transport Association, is calling for the impounding of unlicensed vehicles. It is also supporting other initiatives to promote high standards of driving, such as the good lorry code. On impounding, will the Minister tell us the results of the survey of 2,000 lorries that he mentioned when he went
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
to see him as part of a delegation some time ago? The hon. Gentleman promised to introduce the impounding of unlicensed lorries if the Department of Transport's survey of 2,000 lorries showed that between 2 per cent. and 5 per cent. are cowboy operators and that there is a significant problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 12, which is headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Time of making objections and representations"</p></blockquote>
deals with the current controls on entry to the industry mentioned in the regulations. The current system for licence applicants is stuck, I am afraid, in the age of the quill pen. The Minister and the Department seem oblivious to the information revolution—sadly, in this instance, they appear to be chugging along in the slow lane of the information superhighway and encouraging a long tailback of HGV abuse behind them. The weakness of these requirements is compounded by poor communication between the police, the licensing authorities and the vehicle inspectorate. There is no shared information network which combines the intelligence from all three enforcement agencies. Brake claims that
	<br><blockquote><p>"application forms for operator licences are hardly cross-checked at all by traffic area offices."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Minister will correct me if Brake is wrong about that. An operator with a string of convictions can claim that he has no criminal record and his deceit probably will not be picked up.

I have here a visual aid in the form of an HGV application for a licence. It is a self-certifying form—asked whether he has any previous convictions, an applicant can simply tick the box marked "No". For those who say yes, the form asks for a list of convictions. The applicant is asked about his professional competence and whether he is bankrupt. He need simply fill out the form, send the application to the traffic commissioner and then—nothing. He can be bankrupt and have a string of convictions, but no one bothers to check through another agency whether he is fit to run an HGV. I know that the Minister is concerned about that, so I beg him to reconsider the position in light of the survey which his Department is conducting but which is not in the public domain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pendle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is certainly a lack of liaison between the courts, the police and the licensing authorities.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. We want local authorities to have some approved access to such information—if not directly, then from another source. I enter a caveat about people's civil liberties and about information being spread far and wide but believe none the less that when highly specific applications are being dealt with, highly specific checks through one agency or another are needed to ensure that local authorities are involved. People with long strings of convictions should not be able simply to fill out a form, get an HGV, set up an operating centre and rev up their lorries first thing in the morning and last thing at night

with bits falling off them and smoke belching out at the back, but that is what a tiny minority of cowboy operators are currently able to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Computerised enforcement intelligence such as that held on the police national computer is the only way to combat that dangerous fraud. The cases that I have described are examples not of road rage or of people overtaking and cutting one up but of crimes in which people are killed. We should use all the means of technology available—with the necessary human rights safeguards—to ensure that such people are brought to book. One speaks with a bit more vehemence on this subject after one has met the families of the victims. It is a shame that we cannot hear from them today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current system of intelligence relies on the names of applicants for goods vehicle licences being listed by traffic area operators in a publication entitled "Applications and Decisions, which is published fortnightly. In response to a parliamentary question on 9 January, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Copies are sent to statutory objectors, including the police, to check the details of applicants for operator licences against their records."</p></blockquote>
In admitting that the current system was not adequate, the Minister added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our longer-term aim is the development of a common database for operators and drivers for enforcement and licensing purposes, and which will provide links to enable traffic commissioners to receive information from other sources relevant to their licensing and discipline decisions."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 9 January 1996; Vol. 269, c. 	<i>46.</i>]</p></blockquote>
Why is that a "longer-term aim"? The Minister has conceded the case. Does the Department of Transport have insufficient resources to move into the information age? I could be petty and party political by suggesting that, with the recent salvaging of the roads programme, a little money might be reallocated to plug in one or two computers from A to B to ensure that such checks could be made not in the longer term, but in as short a term as possible. Will the Minister tell us the time scale that he has in mind?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I asked the Minister to clarify how many people had successfully obtained licences and had subsequently been found to have a criminal record, he refused to answer. He argued that it would be too expensive to acquire that information. I should have thought that traffic area operators would be well aware when an application from a convicted person had slipped through the net and that the Minister could not argue in all conscience that writing to each traffic area would cost too much money. I suspect, however, that I did not receive a direct answer because there is a problem and because no one wants to admit it and no one wants the press and public to know its true extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In lieu of answers from the Department, I carried out a short piece of telephone research. Within a few hours, I discovered the case of an operator who applied for a licence in September 1994, and had failed to declare on the form previous convictions for illegal operation of heavy goods vehicle, illegal disposal of waste and handling stolen goods—just the sort of chap we want to push through the system quickly, and to provide with an HGV licence, of course. He continued to operate until June 1995, when a report on poor maintenance was
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
actioned. Only then did the convictions come to light. It turned out that the operator had held a licence prior to that issued in September 1995, and that that had been revoked because of maintenance problems. What is it necessary to do to be denied an HGV licence?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an Opposition Member, with correspondingly limited resources, can find out such information, I should have hoped that the Department of Transport, with its huge resources and clout, would be able to provide us with more comprehensive, publicly available statistics on the extent of the problem. However, figures in the Government's Curtis report reveal that it is the general public, rather than statutory bodies, who raise issues concerning applications for operators' licenses. There is little in the relevant statutory instrument relating to the way in which such matters could influence the development of a safer HGV industry. The figures that are given for 1993–94, for the number of objections and representations concerning applications for HGV operators' licences, reveal that 5 per cent. were opposed. The vast majority of the representations came from the general public in the vicinity of the operating centre—a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) pertinently raised. More than 7,000 such representations and objections were made on environmental grounds. I understand that the statutory instrument will provide for such complaints to be made at any time, and that is welcome. However, only 54 objections came from the police. They objected to only 0.14 per cent. of the 37,000-plus applications in 1993–94.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps that fact bears witness to the good repute of the applicants, but I am afraid that common sense tells me that some people with criminal pasts may be slipping through the net—and even filling out the form dishonestly, without being caught by a police check. An effective computer network would not eliminate those occurrences, but it would make them far less likely. Far fewer people with criminal convictions would slip through the net, obtain licences and operate HGVs illegally on the roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Improvements are also needed to the information flow between the agencies. The problem does not end with cross-checking procedures. Cases have already arisen in which operators have offended but the information has not been passed between agencies, because there is no computer network. I congratulate the Government on the setting up, at long last, of a trial scheme in south Wales and Scotland, so that traffic areas can be informed by local courts of hauliers' convictions for not possessing an operator's licence. The scheme must be expanded, but the relevant statutory instrument does not refer to it. Its expansion would allow the establishment of an up-to-date computer network, passing on information about all convictions relevant to lorry drivers or haulage bosses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ideally, the computer network should connect all the enforcement agencies and traffic areas. That is vital, because at the moment too little information is being passed between courts, licensing authorities and enforcement agencies. Additionally, of course, we should want the network to be connected, if possible, to the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of people carrying out enforcement has dropped, so that there is less information on cowboy operators. In considering the statutory instrument and discussing the return of licences and discs, we should be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
aware that since 1991 the number of vehicle examiners, who are responsible for checking the physical safety of vehicles and maintenance levels, has dropped from 260 to 241. The number of traffic examiners, who check vehicle licences, has also been reduced, from 204 to 191.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I served on another statutory instruments Committee yesterday, in which we approved a marvellous statement of intent about marine pollution. Sadly, cutting back the Marine Safety Agency and the Coastguard Agency flies in the face of those fine sentiments. The fine sentiments in the order must be underpinned by adequate numbers of vehicle and traffic examiners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand that that is not the end of the story. Further efficiency gains may be made by enforcement authorities, which have not been used to raise standards of enforcement. In a recent document, the Freight Transport Association said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"efficiency gains made by enforcement authorities on safety checks for lorries should be used to improve standards rather than just to maintain existing levels."</p></blockquote>
It could have added, to reduce existing levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order fails to give clear guidance to licensing authorities. The current system of autonomous traffic areas is producing an unreasonable amount of variation in decisions on the granting and revoking of licences. The authorities need clear guidelines. We need something clearer than the rather obscure drafting of the order, which may perhaps be necessary, but is none the less not easily accessible to members of the public, victims or their families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clear guidelines would help to remove the inconsistencies between the rulings of different licensing authorities and would tackle the problem of lenient rulings, which so enrage our constituents—and Members of Parliament—when they come to light. Such inconsistencies can ultimately lead to the sort of tragic deaths to which I referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such detailed guidelines, which I understand would be welcomed by many of the licensing authorities, should include advice on who should give evidence at public inquiries. It is vital that the police, victims and their families and other relevant bodies be given every opportunity to state their objections to dangerous operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, on the failure of the order and of present laws to ensure that companies that fail to maintain their lorries properly receive severe penalties, there is overwhelming evidence that companies that are directly responsible for deaths because of poor maintenance are literally getting away with manslaughter. I have already mentioned the Sowerby Bridge case and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax will speak about that later. It is an example of how the Crown Prosecution Service fails properly to address the tragic deaths caused by HGVs, despite the evidence that illegal practices are to blame.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system is failing to hand out sentences that match the crimes—for crimes they are. For example, the 38-tonne tanker driven by Loretta Campbell, which crashed into a car on the hard shoulder killing three young men. She had exceeded her maximum driving hours and had probably fallen asleep at the wheel. The tachograph was nowhere to be found. Yet on 17 November, she was convicted of careless driving and fined £500—less than £200 per life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
The Mitchells, whom we met this morning, spoke of a tape recording in which the driver who was finally to kill their son in an accident on the A1 told his employer, "I am over my time. I am tired. I cannot do the next run. I have worked my hours." He was told in no uncertain terms that, if that was how he wanted to play it, he was effectively out of a job. That inference is caught on tape. I cannot say much more about it because the matter is to come to trial shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware that there is mounting concern about the weakness of sentences handed out to operators as opposed to drivers. In may cases the operators are not even charged. The statutory instrument will not correct that—it is wrong that operators are not charged with causing death by dangerous driving.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask for the Committee's complete attention on this point, as I must seek the assistance of hon. Members. There are different issues to discuss—we are talking about charges that could come before the courts. I am alert to the fact that we may do a little damage in trying to do a great deal of good. I ask hon. Members to be careful how matters are presented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the comments that have been made—I emphasise that this is not a rebuke—prompt me to ask hon. Members to be sensitive to the fact that, until an hon. Member reaches the punchline, I am unable to tell whether a matter might be sub judice. For Heaven's sake, please do not conceal such a fact until the end of a contribution. We do not want any Paul Daniels stuff here. Let us have matters out in the open. If there is any risk of something being sub judice, keep it out of the argument and use another form of logic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, Mr. Cook, your advice is good. I shall not refer to specific cases while concluding my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A lorry driver is in charge of a potentially lethal weapon and has responsibilities to drive with maximum care and attention. An operating company should have the same responsibilities, but I hope that I have shown that where drivers and, above all, companies do not take those responsibilities seriously, accidents often happen and operators can get away scot free.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The large amount of freight now travelling between European countries makes it essential that the Government, or an incoming Government, take steps to simplify procedures to ensure that it is easier to prosecute drivers and companies for offences not committed in the country of origin. I urge the Minister to use his power and to move quickly to save further lives. We will support the Government in Committee and in the Chamber, if they urgently take sensible action to address those problems. It is tragic that we are debating red tape when we could be discussing effective measures to prevent such tragedies. Such effective measures are not in the statutory instrument. I urge the Minister to bring them forward quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.12 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) mentioned red tape. Will the Minister fill in the gaps between the Government's deregulation initiative, which bears heavily in this area, and the proposals in the statutory instruments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
We need tougher regulations and better enforcement for the reasons that have been set out. I pay tribute to the work of Brake, which sent us all a comprehensive dossier setting out the tragic accidents that could have been averted if the regulations had been enforced and followed through. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North stated that the number of inspectors appointed to inspect such vehicles has fallen from 260 to 241. I was not familiar with that figure. However, the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments received a note from the Department of Transport about increased fees, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The money received from the fees also pays for enforcement work carried out by the Vehicle Inspectorate".</p></blockquote>
The Committee is being invited to nod through increases in fees, when the number of people employed to check that vehicles are safe is falling. That is an Alice in Wonderland state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss continuing licensing. The Minister will have at his fingertips the answers to my questions, because he sat on the Standing Committee that considered the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. He will be totally familiar with all those matters. In that Committee, we were told that the purpose of the deregulation initiative was to lift burdens while retaining necessary protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of goods and passenger service vehicles, we were told in the Department of Trade and Industry's publication "Cutting Red Tape"—I do not have the date to hand—that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Safeguards for safety and the environment would be maintained"</p></blockquote>
with the introduction of continuing licensing. Yet, later in the publication it flags up a possible, vitally important change to the Road Traffic Act 1988. I shall quote from it, because it is illustrative of the Government's thinking.
	<br><blockquote><p>"At present, heavy goods vehicles which are altered in a way which may affect safe operating weights must be inspected by the Vehicle Inspectorate before revised operating weights can be authorised. In practice, a physical inspection is not always necessary, and it is proposed to amend the Act so that a re-examination need not be required in every case."</p></blockquote>
I am told by the clerk to the Deregulation Select Committee that the consultation finished last year and the Government will be introducing a deregulation measure to implement that change to the Road Traffic Act. The vehicle inspectorate, which we talked about a few minutes ago, need not physically inspect a heavy goods vehicle that has been altered in a way that may affect its safety. That is a matter of great concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that the Minister is knowledgeable about these matters. You may think that I am approaching the subject from a tangent, Mr. Cook, but my remarks are pertinent to the statutory instrument. In January 1994, again as part of the much-heralded deregulation initiative, the Government published a booklet called "Deregulation Task Forces Proposals for Reform". On page 49, the transport deregulation task force lists proposed changes to vehicle regulations. That recommendation to central Government says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Operator Licensing—there is a multiplicity of traffic areas and licence requirements which should be simplified."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I do not know if the statutory instrument purports to simplify the requirements in any way. Perhaps the Minister will tell us in his reply. There is a contradiction between what the Government said a couple of years ago and what they are saying today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third and final point relates to operating centres. With the introduction of continuous licensing, the licence must be renewed every five years simply by the payment of a fee. The object of continuous licensing is to get rid of paperwork and cut red tape. Once an operator has a licence it continues indefinitely, as with a driving licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. Steve Norris)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously I want the hon. Gentleman to make his point, but it would be useful for him to make it against an accurate background. It is misleading—I know that the hon. Gentleman would not want to mislead the Committee—to suggest that some kind of perpetuity is granted in relation to an operator's licence or the licence of an operating centre. The quinquennial review procedure remains—that is utterly fundamental. Only if, in the preceding five years, there has been no notified objection or interest of any sort in an application, does the licence continue and even then, only after those facts have been ascertained. I caution the hon. Gentleman against the assumption that there is an element of perpetuity merely because of the payment of an appropriate fee. That simply is not the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a helpful clarification. But perhaps the Minister can tell us the mechanisms for informing people living around an operating centre which enable them to object to that licence. Will those involve the local authority? Will there be advertisements in the local paper? Will the residents be notified in the way that people are ordinarily notified about a planning application with signs on lamp posts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us back to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) made about none of the elements communicating with each other. One such case in my constituency has been going on for ages. The residents of the area around the station garage site at Foulridge have been up in arms about early morning traffic, HGV repairs and engines revving up in the middle of the night and they do not know how to complain about it. That underlines the point that I made earlier. Under the new arrangement, which I hope the Minister will clarify, the local authority and the residents have to be told of their right to object. They have to be informed what their rights are. My fears are that, with continuous licensing, they will not appreciate that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I turn to the points that Brake made in its submission, which were enumerated earlier. We agree with some of the measures in the statutory instrument. We have highlighted the omissions. We need a power to impound unlicensed operators' vehicles. I am worried—I hope that the Minister will satisfy me on this—that, as things stand, an operator is not required to prove that maintenance on the vehicle was carried out by a professionally trained mechanic. This is immensely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have just had my old, battered Montego serviced by a garage in my constituency. I do not know whether that was done by a qualified mechanic, but two days ago I broke down on the motorway 30 miles north of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Birmingham. It is chilling to imagine the consequences if an HGV loaded up with God knows what broke down and the maintenance had been carried out by an unqualified mechanic. I should like the Minister to reassure me on that point and to meet the concerns of Brake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am mindful of the time limitation on our deliberations this evening, but I am happy that the hon. Lady should exercise her unquestionable right to express her opinion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.23 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Alice Mahon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Halifax)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I have a few comments about the statutory instruments and what is missing from them. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North that this is part of the Government's deregulation. It will do nothing to help the situation surrounding the accident at Sowerby Bridge in my constituency. At about 9 o'clock in the morning on Monday 6 September 1993, a fully laden large goods lorry was driven down Pye Nest road near Sowerby Bridge towards the Bolton Brow mini roundabout. Owing to the grossly defective condition of the brakes, the vehicle went out of its driver's control and collided with a Ford transit van. The large goods vehicle then pushed the transit van on to the offside pavement and into the adjacent buildings. Four pedestrians and the drivers of each vehicle died as a result of their injuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case is well documented; people know about it because it has gone through the courts. I shall follow your guidance, Mr. Cook, and not refer to the courts, because there is an appeal in the offing against the judicial review decision. However, the brakes were defective. The court imposed the maximum fine of £5,000. The licence has been revoked and the firm closed. But that firm had been at fault before; it is a persistent offender. It closed down but got its licence back and can now operate again. After a penalty of a £5,000 fine and the relatively minor matter of the withdrawal of its licence for 12 months, the firm is back on the road again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have studied this statutory instrument in great detail, looking hopefully for some sign that it will send the right messages to cowboy hauliers, but it does not. This is a typical Government measure that says very little and will do nothing to reassure those still trying to come to terms with the dramatic and tragic events in that small village of Sowerby Bridge in my constituency. I am bitterly disappointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the sake of time, I ask the Minister to consider the very serious points made by my hon. Friend for Nottingham, North. Will the hon. Gentleman ask himself honestly whether cutting back on inspectors will do anything to stop this kind of thing happening again? Thank you, Mr. Cook, for allowing me to plead the case for my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.26 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Shettleston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North, I wish to declare an interest. My constituency is also sponsored by the Transport and General Workers Union although, as is the case with my hon. Friend, the union has not been in contact with me about the statutory instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
I also wish to congratulate my hon. Friend on his excellent speech expressing all that concerns many of us about the weaknesses of the measure. In my experience, most road haulage operators are reputable and law abiding, but there are still far too many who are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is encouraging to note that the Freight Transport Association is concerned that the penalties proposed will not deter those who are determined to break the licensing rules. Along with most members of the Committee, the association believes that the maximum permitted fine of only £2,500 should be substantially increased—as well as the impounding of vehicles, as my hon. Friend said, I believe that impounding vehicles whenever necessary and whenever possible is essential if we are ever to drive the cowboys off our roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Imposing penalties is all very well, but we must catch and detect offenders before imposing any penalty on them. I believe, although I have no evidence, that only the tip of the iceberg is ever brought to the attention of the courts. The chance of being caught on our roads is so remote that many operators consider it a chance well worth taking. They break the law willy-nilly because they know that they will not be detected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend highlighted the reduction in the number of vehicle examiners; to have 241 examiners covering the whole of Great Britain is totally inadequate. I hope that the Minister will seriously consider that. If the Government are serious about tackling the problem, they need to increase substantially the number of inspectors carrying out checks on vehicles on the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which roadside checks are carried out is another cause for concern. I may be wrong, but I understand that a routine is followed and that checks are carried out at the same time, on the same days and at the same intervals. Car drivers—let alone lorry drivers—know when and where the tests are taking place. Depending on the part of the country one is in, one can find out whether one is liable to be subject to a spot check. If someone wishes to avoid one, it is easy for him or her to do so. The system is definitely flawed. I am concerned that many people may be able to escape detection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most HGV drivers do an excellent job on all kinds of roads and in all kinds of weather and traffic conditions. They do their work within the law. We are worried about those who do not act within the law. Often they do not do that voluntarily, but because unscrupulous operators and employers force them to do certain things such as driving when fatigued and for more than the permitted hours. Vehicles may not be properly maintained and tachographs and other equipment may have been tampered with. Or the driver may be told that if he does not work in that way, there will be no job for him. Anyone who forces an employee to work in that way is not fit to be an operator. Such people should be weeded out and taken off the roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the Government for attempting to do something about the problem, but, like my hon. Friends, I think that the regulations do not go far enough. I hope that the Minister will heed some of the points that Opposition Members have made today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.31 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my unfortunate task to remind the Committee of what we are here to do. Our job is to consider the regulations and fees regulations that relate to the licensing of operators and the fees payable by them for goods vehicle licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
The background to both sets of regulations is the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995, which came into force on 1 January 1996. They replace the much amended Goods Vehicles (Operators' Licences, Qualifications and Fees) Regulations 1984. Those regulations were mainly made under part 5 of the Transport Act 1968. Part 5 of that Act has been amended many times—most recently by the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. It was repealed when the 1995 Act—a purely consolidating Act—came into force on 1 January 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be clear what changes the regulations introduce. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North and his hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall), for Pendle and for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon), under your typically generous and relaxed chairmanship, Mr. Cook, explored issues that go slightly wider than those in the regulations. With your customary good nature, Mr. Cook, you allowed the discussion to broaden in that way. Accepting that that is the basis on which the Committee can proceed, I shall say a word about those major issues. My principal task, however, is to underline what the regulations mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Pendle or one of his hon. Friends gave the game away. He referred to the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994, but I do not want unfairly to criticise whoever it was. I am sure that Opposition Members are more than able to share the blame. At least one of them remarked that the Conservatives are obsessed with deregulation and do not care about safety—that it is not an issue for them. Anybody with the slightest appreciation of the process of and motivation behind deregulation would understand that it is based on a solid premise: that deregulation never is or should be a process whereby safety standards are relaxed, consumer protection is withdrawn, and regulations that are valuable to the public in giving them rights or safe operating regimes are removed to assist the mythical cowboys who obsess Opposition Members—an obsession that gives the lie to the fine words used by their economic spokesmen around the City.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reality, if one can be entirely satisfied that there will be no diminution in safety; that not only are citizens' rights not reduced, but that, arguably, they are increased and made more flexible; and that it is possible to remove the burden of utterly pointless bureaucracy from industry, deregulation is something that any responsible Government who want an active economy should make it their job to enforce. They should remove the red tape.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

They differ from the preceding regime only to the extent that they now allow more rights to citizens—to the neighbours of operating centres, to answer the point raised by the hon.

The hon. Member for Nottingham, North spoke for more than 40 minutes. I hope that he will allow me, in the 23 that remain, to respond to some of the more misleading points that he raised. He attempted to turn the Committee into a forum for debate on the entire issue of heavy vehicle licensing. I am dealing with the regulations that are before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 set in train the removal of bureaucracy—the type of bureaucracy that was inherent in a process by which, under the status quo ante, those who wanted to renew operators' licences were required not only to go through a considerable amount of entirely nugatory paperwork but to pay for advertisements in local papers, which provided a single opportunity for people to object. Hon Members who were sufficiently familiar with the regulations would have recognised that a real restriction existed upon the right of a citizen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ironically, only statutory objectors' objections were considered. Those had to be lodged within time, which in practice meant within a short envelope immediately around the expiry of the old licence and the issue of the new one. Such a state of affairs is awful and cannot be in the interests of the citizen. I am deeply shocked that Opposition Members should want to perpetrate so extraordinary an arrangement and to have it continue. We have replaced it with a process that is both flexible and directed at the real rights and needs of the individual citizen. That was done on the basis of evidence that the hon. Member for Nottingham, North nearly—I stress nearly—fell into the trap of quoting. I imagine that he suddenly realised that his argument was slightly counter-productive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1994–95, there were almost 16,000 renewal applications, of which 119 were refused and 145 issued in reduced terms. In other words—and we now come to the real point of the new regulations and of the application of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 to operators' licensing—of 16,000 renewal applications, more than 15,750 were granted exactly on the terms applied for. The reason for that was perfectly straightforward: there had been not the slightest objection from any member of the public or statutory objector to detain the licensing authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, if one is concerned about the interests of the road haulage industry and wants to remove unnecessary burdens from the backs of members of the Road Haulage Association and the Freight Transport Association—in my experience they are decent, competent operators who care about standards—one should concentrate one's attention on the 200 or 300 out of the 16,000 applications that actually give rise to substantive issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke of the advantage to the citizen. What could the advantage be? It is perfectly simple: under the new arrangements, every licence must be reviewed every five years and the traffic commissioner has the obligation of considering any objection during the preceding five years and can take into account, not only those objections received in the advertised notice period, but any objection
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
at any time. In theory, he could go back four and a half years and refer, for example, to a concern expressed six months after the granting of a first licence about the conditions around an operating centre—the hon. Member for Nottingham, North spoke about noisy or smoky operation, for example, which would be a perfectly proper concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The traffic commissioner now has much more flexibility and much wider opportunities to take a concern into account, to investigate it and see whether there is any substance in it, and, if there is, to take the strong action that was permitted under the old regulations and continues to be permitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say in absolutely certain terms about which there can be no equivocation whatever that there is not a single respect, either significant or insignificant, in which any citizen's rights or the rights of the traffic commissioner are reduced by the new regulations for controlling the heavy goods traffic industry. I want that to be absolutely clearly understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, North drew attention to matters with which I have been concerned for several years and on which I worked for several years before he came to his present portfolio—he was generous enough to acknowledge that. I shall take a couple of minutes to answer some of the points that he made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On impounding, I must tell the Committee that previous Secretaries of State took the view that impounding was a sledgehammer to crack a nut and, perhaps, an inappropriate measure. My view, which is probably born of an innate cynicism and a less generous nature than that of my former colleagues—indeed, a less generous nature than yours, Mr. Cook—is that impounding may be justified. I put that issue back on the agenda because I thought that it was right to do so. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North mentioned the 2 per cent. to 5 per cent. of operators who might be determined to without any licence and who would therefore be vulnerable to impounding measures. I have never said that a minimum or maximum proportion of the heavy goods vehicle operating fleet should be seen to be operating illegally before we would consider introducing impounding. We are studying the raw data that we have received on that issue, largely because apparently there are some technical flaws in it. Some crosschecks between the original data and that available to the vehicle inspectorate show that we may need to revisit some of that territory. It would be wrong to be hooked solely on the idea that we must prove the proposition related to impounding beyond any shadow of doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since I have revived that proposal the legitimate industry—the Freight Transport Association and the Road Haulage Association—has been as vociferous as anyone because it recognises that it is in its interest that we get rid of rogue operators. I make it clear that every one of my right hon. and hon. Friends shares our conviction that we will have no truck with cowboys, if that is not an inappropriate pun. I do not have the slightest sympathy for cowboys. I do not even regard their existence as vaguely humorous. That fact that such people are out there is of the utmost concern. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North suggested that what they did was not merely inadvertent but downright criminal and I entirely agree with him. That is exactly how that sort of activity should be viewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
The hon. Gentleman raised important issues relating to our ability to filter information about operators from various sources into the hands of the traffic commission. He came to see me about one issue. However, this is a public occasion and the hon. Gentleman needed to set that issue into a political context. It is a kneejerk reaction displayed by all professional politicians. He expressed frustration and indignation and blamed the sclerotic indifference of the Government. I could go on but I fear that I would bore my right hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire because he has heard all this before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a logistical problem. Broadly speaking, it is not difficult to ensure that information obtained by the vehicle inspectorate about individual operators is fed through to the traffic commissioners. That process is ongoing; we are achieving benefits and will continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I will not disguise our concern about our ability to gather as much information as we would like in one area—feeding back to the traffic commissioners information from proceedings in the magistrates or other courts about persons who are convicted. There are many reasons why that is not simply a matter of spending a few million pounds, as the hon. Member for Nottingham, North suggested. However, my hon. Friends will note that yet another expenditure commitment has been made by the Opposition. They will log it along with the daily diatribe of such commitments that we have come to expect. Any person who holds a public service or heavy goods vehicle licence would need to be considered under the conduct regime regulations administered by the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider the massive number of offences and the large number of persons who would therefore technically be covered by the need to have a comprehensive system of information operating in every magistrates court. The magistrates courts systems are not all entirely compatible because the magistracy has a degree of independence, which Opposition Members have been the first to cherish. No doubt it is extremely valuable, but it can be frustrating when trying to produce a common intelligence system to feed information through to the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would then need to study the hundreds of offences which, somehow, the magistrates' clerks would have to be aware were offences of which the traffic commissioners would have to be notified. That presents the magistracy—not the traffic commissioners, at the receiving end, or the vehicle inspectorate, where the relationship is more direct—with considerable problems, not so much in transferring information but in garnering it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, North shakes his head, but I would welcome his concrete suggestions as to how the matter should be resolved—I have always believed that even a stopped clock is right once a day. If he has a good idea, I shall not hesitate to employ it. I want an outcome as much as he does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it astonishing that, apparently, there are no software programs that would allow one magistrates court to communicate with another? It must be possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister shakes his head in exasperation, but it must be possible to categorise offences. Offence 47 may mean X and offence 48 may mean Y, so computers could communicate with each other. That is basic stuff and it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the Government could introduce such a system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have just suggested, the software is the least of the problems, which the hon. Member for Pendle would know if he had been listening. The problem is practical—individual magistrate's clerks would be required to have an even more encyclopaedic appreciation of the consequences of any offence than they have at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. Gentleman to address his concerns to the Magistrates Association, if he believes that he has a solution to its problem which is as facile as the one he just advanced. No doubt the association would welcome hearing of it. The reality is that it is all too easy to dismiss the serious efforts that the magistracy has put in. I pay tribute to its efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a related point, I have discussed with the Magistrates Association its attitude to the penalties imposed on those who offend several of the more significant elements of the heavy goods safety regime. If I may for once, I shall be even more graphic than the hon. Gentleman. On far too many occasions, operators are fined sums, perhaps for operating with a bald tyre, that are less than the cost of replacing the tyre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that in certain circumstances the magistracy is obliged to take into account the personal circumstances of anyone before the court. I reminded the magistracy—may I take the opportunity to put it on the record—that, as the hon. Member for Nottingham, North remarked, it has to consider acts that are not inadvertent but criminal. He and I attach a great deal of importance to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I must make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that I am slightly irritated that he has attempted to turn this into a party political matter. That was not his approach when we met. Then, he was as constructive as I had expected him to be in Committee. He acknowledged that the exercise was about logistics, not money or software. The matter is extraordinarily complex and one that any Government will need to be dedicated to, if they are to do their job adequately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to try to set the record straight for the victims' families, who take the matter very seriously. I shall not respond to the Minister's earlier bluster about deregulation. I did not enter into that debate. I shall not respond to his bluster about bringing party politics into this. People should read the record. It will clearly show that I went to great lengths to praise the Minister for his kind words on some of these issues and I tried to seek a consensus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any Government should take action on this matter, regardless of its political character. On the point about computerisation, it is clear that the cases are entered into the record—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is the hon. Gentleman making an intervention or a further speech?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am making an intervention, Mr. Cook.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must come to the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the computerisation of information regarding offences takes place anyway. It is not beyond the wit of man to devise a system by which they could be flagged up automatically, not by a clerk at a magistrates court but by the technology itself. That would talk to the police computer which talks to the traffic commissioner's computer. On the figures on cowboys, if the Minister says we are exaggerating the cowboys percentage he should publish the report so that we can know the true figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot revisit points that have been dealt with at such length before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Cook. The hon. Gentleman invites people to read the record. I invite them to do exactly that. Praising with faint damns is a great Opposition speciality. They seek to convey an impression of Government indifference when they should know, because new Labour is supposed to be a party of realism and professionalism—at least that is what the leaflet says—that these issues cannot be dismissed by a wave of the arm. They are extremely complex, and officials—for whom I at least, have the greatest respect—have worked extremely hard to get to the point where we have a workable system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, North made one reference—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recall that I have three minutes remaining. Of course I give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister. I should like to ask him about the point he made about magisterial courts and I commend him for that involvement. What discussions, if any, did he have with the Scottish equivalents? Did he discuss the matter with his counterpart in the Scottish Office, because the Scottish input into this matter is equally important?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes; in fact the arrangements in Scotland are already different. The Scottish traffic area office works in close co-operation with the equivalent courts in Scotland so that the major emphasis has been on developing something which we hope will be as effective, and arguably more effective, for England and Wales. But territorial considerations will not detain us in these matters. We obviously want as safe a regime as it is possible to operate throughout the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, North raised the issue of downright dishonesty in the completion of an application form. That is a perfectly fair point to raise. However I remind him that the police check very carefully on operators whose applications are notified to them. They receive the information fortnightly from the traffic commissioner—as, incidentally do the other statutory objectors, including some relevant trade unions. They can all at that point object to the granting of a licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
For the record, the person who makes a dishonest declaration in relation to such a licence would be subject under section 39 of the 1995 Act, to a fine of up to £2,500—the maximum—merely for the false declaration. The hon. Gentleman and I share the intention of ensuring that the opportunity for fraud and for inadequate standards is reduced even further. The regulations will go a long way towards doing that. They will also enable us to remove a wholly unnecessary burden of bureaucracy from a large number of legal and decent operators who provide an invaluable service to consumers and businesses alike in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
