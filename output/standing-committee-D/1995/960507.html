Child Support Departure Direction (Anticipatory Application) Regulations 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Wicks <span class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Child Support Departure Direction (Anticipatory Application) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 6335).</p></blockquote>
I do not intend to detain the Committee for too long, but I should like to ask the Minister some specific questions about the regulations. As an introduction to my brief remarks, may I say that the Government and Parliament are now struggling to bring some justice and fairness into the child support system? It is an administrative system which, in the eyes of some, does not bring the same justice to bear that a court-based system might.<br><br>
As we know, Parliament has taxed itself for several years in considering the implementation of child support and the practice of the Child Support Agency. It is fair to say that the agency has come in for considerable criticism from both sides of the House of Commons. It was no surprise when the Government introduced the new Child Support Act 1995 to make amendments which, in general, Opposition Members welcomed and, indeed, had urged.<br><br>
The regulations concern the piloting of what is known as the departure system, and will bring greater flexibility to it. It is easy to consider only one party—for example, the so-called absent parent or the parent with care—but it is much more difficult to get the balance right when considering the child's interests and maintenance between the parents.<br><br>
Although at the beginning of the agency's life, most of the criticisms of it that came to me via my advice surgery were from the so-called absent parent—typically the father—I am now seeing a striking shift in the balance. Rather more parents with care—typically mothers—are coming forward. They say, "I thought Parliament had legislated for child support, but I've got two children and the father's never paid me a penny." The right balance must be achieved.<br><br>
One of the departures concerns children who are not the natural children of one of the parents in their family—in common parlance, step-children. The departure regulations will bring some justice to their situation. First, will the Minister explain the approach of the Department of Social Security and the CSA to step-children? Which step-children are included in the regulations and which are excluded? How does the regime for step-children relate to the obligations of the child's natural father—the so-called absent parent—to support him or her? That is an important issue. In
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
recent years. Parliament's attention has focused more on the one-parent family phenomenon—it certainly involves large numbers and issues—and less on stepchildren, and yet perhaps one in 11 or one in 12 children in this country live in step-families. The issue is therefore important in terms of the operation of the CSA.<br><br>
Secondly, I note that the Government have not introduced a departure for child-care costs. Many would argue that for some so-called absent parents who have a second family, the costs of care for their children might be as important in terms of the family budget as, say, travel-to-work costs. Why has no departure been brought forward for child-care costs?<br><br>
That brings me to my third point: travel-to-work costs. In the early days, one of the common criticisms of the CSA was that travel-to-work costs were not really allowed for. The departure concept endeavours to introduce a policy to allow for travel-to-work costs, and it would be helpful if the Minister were to explain what that policy is and how he envisages it operating in practice.<br><br>
My fourth specific point concerns the further departure—the departure from the basic formula—in terms of a person who tells the agency. "Here is my declared income; it is low; I cannot afford much child maintenance", but who is perceived by some, including, perhaps, his ex-wife, to have a life style which seems, if not lavish, significantly better than would be suggested by his income. There is a departure to deal with that, which does not exclusively affect the self-employed, although in my experience, the self-employed are numerous among those who might use their company as a means to avoid child maintenance obligations. Anecdotally from advice surgery, women tell us of men who claim to earn only a certain income, but who, in practice, have a great life style, a great house and a smart car, and pay their new wife or partner a great salary in order to reduce the profits of the company—or whatever. It would be helpful if the Minister could explain the Government's approach to that situation.<br><br>
We are aware that the CSA have been under enormous pressure administratively, to put it mildly. Although some of the indicators are moving in the right direction, we know that there have been problems of error and maladministration. However, the Government want to give the CSA quite substantial and sometimes complex new duties. Does the Minister assume that those will be fulfilled under existing resources, and can he give us some reassurance that the new duties will not make the agency's pretty poor record even poorer? In simple terms, can the CSA cope administratively with the new departure system alongside its other duties?<br><br>
We are discussing pilot regulations—regulations that introduce pilots—and it would be helpful if the Minister could tell us something about the pilots: how they are being monitored, whether there are any independent monitors or researchers of the scheme and what form of report will be brought to Parliament
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0259">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
so that we can all be satisfied that the issues have been piloted properly and that their outcomes are successful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Steen <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Hams)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman can help me with the term "pilot regulation". I have never come across it before. Are the Government introducing additional regulations—pilot regulations—that are not real regulations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wicks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be in a better position than I to clarify the terms. The regulations essentially introduce pilot schemes. In other words, they will not operate throughout the country, so the term "pilot regulations" is possibly an abbreviation that is not altogether helpful to the astute among us. No doubt, the Minister will be able to clarify the issue.<br><br>
Under the current appeals procedure, I know that there is scope in certain circumstances for a chairman alone to hear appeals without the two lay representatives. Does the Minister plan to use that mechanism on appeals regarding departures? It would be helpful could he clarify that point.</span></p>
<p>4.40 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Liz Lynne <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rochdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being a few minutes late, Mr. Hill. We are debating the departure regulations because of the basic injustice of the formula initially. Even supporters of the Child Support Act 1991 and the original formula have come to believe that a degree of discretion is essential.<br><br>
I am pleased that step-children for whom parents took responsibility before the Child Support Act came into effect will be taken into account. I should, however, like clarification of the position of stepchildren for whom parents took responsibility after it came into effect. At long last, some children and parents who have gone through misery might receive a little comfort.<br><br>
We cannot, however, help people—including many of my constituents—whose relationships have broken down. I have spoken before about a man who had a good relationship with his son. When the Child Support Agency became involved, he could not visit the child any more, give presents or pay for clothes. His ex-wife used that as a stick with which to beat him and prevented the child from seeing him. She told the child, "Your Daddy doesn't love you any more", and when his father telephoned, he said, "I don't want to see you ever again" and slammed down the phone. We have all heard such cases in our advice surgeries, and they demonstrate the Act's emotional impact on families. In so far as step-children will be taken into account to some degree, I welcome the regulations.<br><br>
I fear, however, that the proposals will be an administrative nightmare and that people will come to my surgery or write to me because they will not receive the answers that they need for the CSA and because their cases will not be dealt with as speedily as they should be. An answer to a parliamentary question showed that, until the end of November 1995, clearance for appeals took 41 weeks. The number of reviews is building up and there is a tremendous backlog. Will the departures lead to an even longer
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
one? I need some assurance from the Minister. As he knows, I shall write to him with questions if the present situation continues. Although I welcome the proposals, they will not be good enough. The CSA is already struggling and could grind to a halt. As the Minister knows, we need to scrap the Act and start again from the beginning.<br><br>
I am concerned about the strict conditions in part II. Someone who completes the departure application and is asked to provide further information must do so in 14 days. Of course, we want the assessment to be speedy, but we should remember that it takes the CSA 41 weeks to check the facts for an appeal. It therefore seems a little unreasonable to tell parents that they will have no case for departure if they fail to provide the extra information in 14 days. Is the 14-day period set? Will there be some leeway if parents have been on holiday or are unable to communicate? Will they have to provide the information in 14 days or face losing their right to the departure? Speed is essential, but is it possible?<br><br>
One ground for departure is the cost of keeping in touch with the child, and I welcome the proposals in that respect because children have suffered for four years. A Joseph Rowntree Foundation report recently stated that the CSA and the Child Support Act had had an adverse effect on children.<br><br>
I am concerned about the problems that the proposals might create. We currently have problems with the 104-night rule, which some parents use to ensure that the liable parent does not have the child for more than 104 nights. Could that happen under the system that we are debating? If the liable father—it is usually the father—does not see the child regularly because the mother with care has denied him contact, will the Child Support Agency be able to use that situation say to him that the departure no longer works because he has not seen his child as often as he had agreed to see him or her? We need clarification, because the CSA could get into a horrendous muddle. Vindictive parents with care may use the system to get their own back on the other parent, be it the father or the mother. A financial penalty would be imposed on the liable parent; probably the father. We need clarification and reassurance that we shall not get into the mess that we found ourselves in on some of the other departures.</span></p>
<p>4.46 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It gives me great pleasure to say a few words—I hope that it gives the Committee as much pleasure. Any Committee whose membership includes the hon. Member for Croydon, North-West (Mr. Wicks) will be sure of a valuable contribution. His contribution to social work before he came to the House of Commons is well known and it was interesting to hear his comments. I am also glad to he on the same child agency or child support all-party group as the hon. Member for Rochdale (Ms Lynne): I am not sure of its title. It meets regularly and it makes a considerable contribution to debates on these matters.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must have the accurate title for <i>Hansard.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Lynne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the all-party child support monitoring group.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what it is called.<br><br>
I have never been on a Committee considering a regulation on departure directions. It sounds like something one would be given at Gatwick or Paddington. What are departure directions? It also refers to anticipatory applications. We are passing rules and regulations in anticipation of someone making an application. These are extraordinarily named regulations, and they include pilot regulations. This is all music to my ears; my interest in regulations is fairly well known.<br><br>
It is not difficult to have an interest in regulations. The Committee will be interested to know that in the previous Session we passed 3,455 statutory instruments, and this regulation is the 1,050th instrument passed in this Session. It should be borne in mind that Lord Sainsbury, when he produced his task force report, suggested the repeal of 605 regulations, but since then we have passed 7,839 new statutory regulations. We are now passing yet another statutory instrument, and the only reason we are doing so is because we got it wrong in the first place. We have had 7,839 new statutory instruments since Lord Sainsbury's task force report either because we got the earlier instruments wrong or because we have wished to amend regulations that we introduced without careful thought. The conclusion that we must draw from that is that we should not pass so many laws. If we did not pass so many laws, we would not require so many statutory instruments amending those laws.<br><br>
I am most concerned about the seemingly endless increase in the volume of secondary legislation. We seem to pass it on a nod and a wink. You know, Mr. Hill, because you have been on these modest Back Benches, that the Whip usually says, "Let's get on with it and get it out in three minutes." That is not the way to study statutory instruments. If we are passing 7,839 statutory instruments, it is wrong to give them only three minutes each: we should give them three hours or three days. If we gave them three days, I am sure that we would not have so many of them.<br><br>
The Conservative party is supposed to be the party of deregulation, but here we are watching more and more regulations zoom past. Every statutory instrument introduces another rule or another regulation. That means more red tape and another layer of bureaucracy to administer. Will my hon. Friend the Minister say whether these departure directions wilt lead to additional bureaucracy, with more civil servants needed to check them? Will another layer of bureaucracy consider the impact of anticipatory applications?<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister should make a deal with his officials: every new statutory instrument introduced could be balanced out by another being brought forward for repeal. If he could do that today I would be happy to sit down, for then at least the measure before us would not increase the total number of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
statutory instruments. However, the Minister does not seem inclined to speak to his officials about such a deal, so perhaps I should make one or two other suggestions.<br><br>
Deregulation gives us an opportunity to reduce the number of Committees on rules and regulations that Members of Parliament have to sit through. All the hon. Members here today could be doing much more important and relevant things. The more primary laws we pass, the more secondary law we have to consider. When we get the primary law wrong, the more we have to come to Committees like this to produce more secondary law.<br><br>
Last July, the Prime Minister told me, on the Floor of the House, that deregulation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that this name dropping is a little unnecessary. The hon. Gentleman must keep to the statutory instrument. I understand that he is trying to prove some new directions himself, but the Minister will not be able to reply to the hon. Gentleman's instant policy, being bound to keep his reply to the statutory instrument. However, the hon. Gentleman should by all means continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Hill, and I agree that this is the wrong place for name dropping. But the Prime Minister said that deregulation was at the heart of our economic policy, and the Deputy Prime Minister—if you will excuse another name drop, Mr. Hill—announced a bonfire of regulations.<br><br>
What has happened? A Select Committee has been set up, with my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Field) as Chairman. He has done marvellous work, but he has not had much to do, having had to consider only 24 deregulation orders. One such order may have come from the Minister's Department, dealing with stillbirth and death registration. The snag is that the measure was not deregulatory: it put up the cost of such registration.<br><br>
I shall not go into the other deregulatory orders, which among other matters covered greyhound racing, the length of the school day, parking equipment and gaming machines, as they are clearly not relevant to today's debate. However, it is interesting to note that the Committee under my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight has met 34 times. Each meeting has lasted one and a half hours, so that means that the Committee's total meeting time has been 51 hours. It has passed 24 deregulation orders which have saved businesses about £628,000. That is about 18p for each firm in the country—a very considerable saving.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Day <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cheadle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned that hon. Members may feel that their time is wasted in Committees such as this. I thought that this Committee was going to discuss child support, a subject that is dear to my heart, as I am a member of the Select Committee on Social Security. My hon. Friend does not appear to be discussing that, however: he seems to be discussing deregulation, and thereby wasting my time.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0261">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not want my hon. Friend to stay if he thought this debate to be neither informative nor educative. While he is right to say that he thought he was coming to the Committee to discuss child support, it is the Committee's duty to consider the wider issue of whether we should be here at all.<br><br>
I think that I have made my point. There is no value in labouring it. The Minister knows my interest in deregulation. Before he became a Minister he was very interested in the subject too. However, the fact that he has introduced this order shows that unfortunately he has been seduced by the weight of Government office and no longer realises the importance of reducing the amount of regulations, or at least of not continuing to add to them.<br><br>
Will the Minister consider how his Department can not increase the number of statutory instruments: that would be the task for 1996? If he does that, at the end of the year I could ask him in a parliamentary question how many regulations he had passed since May 1996 and he could reply that the number had not increased. My hon. Friend is one of the Ministers who will have to answer to the Prime Minister who has made it plain that we should question rules and regulations, as I am doing, and that they should be reduced or minimised, which I am trying to do. I would like confirmation from the Minister that his officials have told him that the present regulations are the minimum necessary to put into effect the departure direction anticipatory application regulations.</span></p>
<p>4.56 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Andrew Mitchell)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, Mr. Hill, may I welcome you to the chair?<br><br>
The regulations pave the way for the trial of an important change in the calculation of child support liability and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Croydon, North-West for arranging our debate so that we can discuss them in detail. During my brief remarks, I shall try to persuade my hon. Friend the Member for South Hams (Mr. Steen), who rightly mentioned our strong interest in deregulation, that the regulations are in the finest traditions of the view that he is advocating and do not run across it.<br><br>
The regulations allow the Child Support Agency to pilot new procedures that will introduce an element of discretion into the way liability for child support is calculated. I emphasise that they are pilot regulations and that it is important that we should pilot them, in view of some of the things that have gone wrong with the Child Support Agency. Under the provisions, the CSA will be able to take account of certain special expenses and other factors that the standard assessment formula is unable to accommodate. The new departure direction system is a major part of the Government's review of the way the Child Support Act 1991 has operated in its first three years. The result will be a more flexible and just regime which should do much to diffuse criticisms of the way the child support system currently operates.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
It would not be helpful to the Committee to explain the content of the regulations in great detail. For the most part, they are self-explanatory, but it may be helpful if I outline the way that the departure scheme can be relied upon to produce fairer calculations of child support liability. First, a parent can cite six special expenses in support of an application. These are: high travel-to-work costs—I shall return to the point made about that; high costs in maintaining contact with the children; costs arising from the illness or disability of the applicant or a dependant; the costs of servicing debts incurred while the family were together; commitments entered into by a parent before his court order was replaced by a CSA assessment; and in certain circumstances, the costs of supporting stepchildren, a point to which the hon. Members for Croydon, North-West and for Rochdale referred and to which I shall return.<br><br>
Secondly, a departure direction can replace the broadbrush allowance for property and capital transfers introduced last April with an accurate figure based upon the actual amount transferred. Thirdly, the departure scheme can deal with some of the avoidance methods that have been springing up, such as instances where an absent parent diverts part of his income to another party in order to reduce his liability. The hon. Gentleman asked me about that point, which concerns both him and me; it principally, but not solely, affects the self-employed and I hope that the pilot scheme will enable us to remedy that injustice. Finally, the scheme will deal with potential inequities in the way the formula calculation deals with housing and travel costs.<br><br>
I shall address, in no particular order, the points raised by hon. Friends and by Opposition Members—if I discover from reading <i>Hansard</i> that I have overlooked any point, I shall write to the hon. Member concerned.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Croydon, North-West said that his experience of the Child Support Agency suggested that the balance of complaints had changed from more men to more women complaining about its workings. I can help him by confirming that he is right. The majority of complaints from men are now about the use of the deduction of earnings order—the DEO—which the Child Support Agency imposes in appropriate cases. One has to work hard to secure a deduction of earnings order. Only when there is a lack of co-operation, which is unfair to the parent with care, are DEOs imposed.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman was also right to identify women's main complaints, which derive principally from those who know that other women are receiving support from the CSA and that they are not. I hope that DEOs, by ensuring that payments get through, will help to improve the situation over the coming months.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked me about the position of the pilot scheme so far. He will appreciate that it has been running for only a few weeks, but the pilot scheme has been successfully launched, the relevant offices opened, the staff fully trained, the information technology system is functioning well and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0262">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
there have been no major operational problems so far. In the few days of the scheme's operation, there have been 4,000 responses and approximately 1,000 full applications with that number steadily rising.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made a point about lifestyle—the asset-rich, income-poor fathers who by and large are seeking to avoid their liabilities are in the lead among the cases that have been referred under the departure scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend said that the staff had been trained, can he confirm that no additional staff are to be taken on as a result of the measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the way in which the funding and staffing will be calculated in a moment if my hon. Friend will bear with me.<br><br>
The CSA will be chasing about 300 cases to which it has been alerted either by the child support agency centres, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, or Members of Parliament, through their constituency caseloads. Those cases appear to have special grounds for a departure and the CSA will pursue them.<br><br>
I was asked about the way in which the information would be interpreted and used. That is a key function of the pilot scheme and we have let a research contract to interview people who have not responded to the approach on departures. That will help to assess how many are likely to apply when the scheme goes live across the country. It is important research that will help the effectiveness of the departure scheme.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Croydon, North-West and for Rochdale asked about step-children. Where financial responsibility for supporting step-children was taken on before the existence of the CSA, it is reasonable to make allowance for costs. Anyone taking on a step-family after 1993 did so in full knowledge that the child support scheme would make no concessions to the additional cost. The departure system does nothing to alter that.<br><br>
The first responsibility is to one's own children, even when step-children have no one to provide for them. When paying the standard formula assessment causes difficulty, however, the protected income calculation will ensure that sufficient disposable income is left after paying child support to meet the needs of all members of the household. The formula has always done that.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked about child care costs. I can tell him that child care is not an issue that has been raised with any frequency by clients of the CSA. That is because the formula already makes significant provision for child care costs through the inclusion in the maintenance requirement of the carer allowance. Where young children are in the family, it amounts to £48 per week. Similarly, parents with care returning to work and claiming family credit will get an allowance towards child care costs, which has been increased to £60 a week from April this year. That is a generous disregard.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
The next point concerned travel-to-work. The majority of parents incur some cost in travelling to their place of employment. For those who face particularly high costs, there is already an allowance within the formula. However, the allowance is broad brush and might not accurately reflect the costs involved. For example, where a man lives and works on opposite sides of an estuary, the application of the rule, which requires the use of straight-line distances, is clearly to his disadvantage. He will, therefore, be able to apply for a departure direction based on the actual cost of his journey.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Croydon, North-West next asked about appeals with one chairman only. We want to ensure that the independent tribunal service has the maximum degree of flexibility to manage that new area of work. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the regulations on appeal are not the subject of today's debate. They will be dealt with when the pilot scheme has been validated and we propose to go live. We will examine how the pilot scheme goes. We are interested in everyone's views on the matters and when we have made a decision, we shall return with appropriate regulations.<br><br>
The final point made by the hon. Member for Croydon, North-West was to do with the level of costs—a point that was picked up by my hon. Friend the Member for South Hams. The departures scheme has a separate, ring-fenced budget which will be specifically tailored to the needs of the departures system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Lynne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the budget will be ring-fenced. Does that mean extra money on top of the money already being put into the Child Support Agency?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves the issue, could we have some details of what the additional costs of the departure will be and why they are necessary? The Child Support Agency has an enormous staff, so surely it can move a few staff around.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has touched on a most important point. That is precisely why we are discussing the pilot regulations today. The purpose of the pilot is to find out accurately how many staff we might need to service the departure system so that we do not waste public resources by not having an accurate assessment. When the pilot has been concluded—I hope at the end of July—we shall move to a firm scheme, going nationwide on about 1 December, and further regulations will come before Parliament and will need to be discussed. Those will be the departure regulations. At that point, as a result of the pilot scheme, I shall be able to give my hon. Friend very detailed costings and analysis. I hope that my hon. Friend wiil be on that Committee—I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway), the Government Whip, is taking notice—so that he will be able to examine the regulations and determine their effectiveness and validity.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is being so good in suggesting that I attend more Committees—nothing gives me greater pleasure, although it might not give other Committee members great pleasure. Can my hon. Friend tell the Committee how much extra this scheme will cost, how many staff are involved and what the implications will be for the civil service? How many more civil servants will be involved in the pilot schemes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have tried to explain to my hon. Friend, the whole purpose of the pilot scheme is to arrive at an accurate calculation of what the costs will be. It is perfectly possible that, before the end of my speech, I will receive a note that might give my hon. Friend an answer to his question about the pilot.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Rochdale said that the pilot scheme for departures emphasises the basic injustice of the legislation. I respectfully submit that that is not the case. The departure scheme accepts that a formula, although fair and right in the vast majority of cases, will be unable adequately to deal with the few cases with rough edges. The departure system is designed to ensure that the key element of fairness is injected into those cases which cannot be adequately dealt with under the formula. The hon. Lady will recall that the all-party Select Committee did not recommend a departure system. We have introduced it because we have heard about cases with hard edges and are determined to address them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Lynne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Minister will come on to this point, but I talked about the administrative nightmare that could be created by the departures. The Minister said that the formula was right to start with, and that that was not the result of it being wrong. Surely, however, we would not need new regulations if the Child Support Act 1995 had worked in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go wide of the regulations, but the hon. Lady's comment about an administrative nightmare was the next point to which I was going to respond. The reason for the pilot scheme is to ensure that the departure regulations are right and fulfil what Parliament and the CSA require of them—to give an extra element of fairness. Piloting them will ensure that we avoid an administrative nightmare.<br><br>
The hon. Lady's next point concerned the 14-day limit. I am happy to confirm that that will be reasonably applied. It is clear that there must be an element of discretion and common sense, and, indeed, there is.<br><br>
I turn to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for South Hams.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Lynne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves my remarks, perhaps he would answer my question. If the parent with care denies access to the liable parent and therefore the visits are curtailed, will the departure stop? In other words, will the CSA step in and say to the liable parent, "You're not visiting your child so often, therefore you must now pay extra"? It could be that a vindictive parent with care had stopped the visits.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be wrong to try to give the hon. Lady a precise answer to her question now. Much depends on other factors that she has not mentioned. In general terms, however, the answer would be yes: a departure direction would be withdrawn at that point. The hon. Lady must bear in mind that in such cases access is a matter for the courts and not for the CSA. In the terms in which she put her question, therefore, a departure direction would be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Lynne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would not the Minister agree that that makes the case for a unified family court system?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the Minister would not agree with that. There is no logical connection, as I think the hon. Lady knows very well.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Hams made several points about secondary legislation and various laws. They are not for me to respond to today, as you, Mr. Hill, observed. I respectfully refer my hon. Friend to the Leader of the House and the Deputy Prime Minister, who will be pleased to hear what he has to say about that.<br><br>
However, in the light of my hon. Friend's inveighing against regulatory power, I put it to him that he should strongly support the concept of good government. Good government, particularly given the track record of the CSA in its early days before the radical improvement that we saw last year, pilots regulations and ensures that they work. These anticipatory regulations anticipate other regulations, which I hope will come before the House in the form of an affirmative resolution later this year. The fact that we are discussing regulations that concern a pilot scheme is in the traditions of good government, which ensures that they work before they become firm regulations. They would then, I am sure, carry my hon. Friend's and my support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that all rules and regulations are therefore part of good government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the Minister is not saying anything of the sort. The regulations should he judged on the ground that they are anticipatory pilot regulations. We are discussing them today to ensure that the CSA's departure system will meet the requirements that we have set out for it. I commend them to my hon. Friend as an example of good government that deserves his support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Lynne Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Selly Oak)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being late, Mr Hill, but I was involved in a statement in the Chamber. The Minister referred to good government; how long will he allow for the evaluation of the success of the pilot scheme, if it is to be implemented in full later this year?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The pilot scheme will be evaluated over as much time as is required. I expect it to be completed at about the end of July and I expect—and hope—that, subject to the pilot scheme validating the plans that it will put into operation, the departure system will be able to go nationwide in December this year.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0264">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
The essence of the pilot scheme is to ascertain whether there are unforeseen difficulties that we have not identified and anticipated. If there are, it is possible that it might take longer for the scheme to come in across the country, but I hope that that will not be the case. Assuming that no major changes are required for either the policy or procedures, I anticipate implementing the full scheme from December, as I said.<br><br>
Committee members should note that any departure direction made during the pilot scheme will have no immediate effect on liability. The directions will be held in abeyance until the full scheme starts. At that point, subject to there being no changes to the details of the scheme, there will be a check that applicants' circumstances are unaltered and the directions will be put into effect.<br><br>
In summary, the changes introduced by the regulations are part of the process of reviewing the child support scheme that we began last year. We have already ensured that maintenance cannot exceed 30
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
per cent. of an absent parent's income. The new arrangements will give us the flexibility that we need to provide extra help for those parents upon whom the formula bears hardest.<br><br>
As the Select Committee on Social Security recognised in its last report, there is a growing acceptance that the CSA is to be a permanent feature of British life. I can confirm that: the child support system is here to stay. The provisions that I have outlined, together with other changes introduced by the Government over the past year and with continuing improvements in the agency's performance, should convince everyone that our approach is correct.</span></p>
