	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Graham Allen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been meeting the Minister regularly—almost every Wednesday—to discuss delegated legislation and, as he pointed out before proceedings began, trailing him around various conferences. We have, I hope, a relatively friendly relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, a delegation from the Transport and General Workers Union and I were talking to one or two of the Minister's hon. Friends about eye tests and heavy goods vehicles. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall) is a distinguished member of the union. I know that you, Mr. McWilliam, will not object if I hand the Minister a gift from the TGWU which relates to the eye tests rules that he has introduced. He might choose to use it at the appropriate moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Wardle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bexhill and Battle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Put it in the Register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is clearly worth less than 50p.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what they told me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the regulations, which will allow the immobilisation of certain untaxed vehicles in five London boroughs. I understand that there is to be a three-month experiment and we wish it well. Being able to immobilise the vehicles of those who drive illegally is an important step forward to which Labour Members are firmly committed. Too much money is lost in unpaid road tax each year—about £160 million—and the regulations will provide a means of deterring tax evasion and of recouping lost revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the regulations are a good start, their focus is somewhat narrow. The campaign is not nation wide and, at the moment, is limited to five London boroughs. If immobilisation proves to be the way forward, we would be keen, as we hope the Minister would be, to expand the scheme to other areas of London and to the whole country. The problem of tax evasion is not confined to those five London boroughs; neither can the deterrent or the punishment be so confined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Another concern is that the Government have focused the measure on cost-effectiveness—which is correct—but have not taken account of road safety as much as some of us might wish. Targeting those few London boroughs obviously means that there will be a relatively high concentration of vehicles with unpaid tax, owing to the heavy volume of traffic in such a small area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ability immediately to immobilise illegal vehicles has much wider potential for improving road safety, which the Minister might want to take into account. Recouping lost revenue must not be allowed to cloud what is a safety issue. To obtain a tax disc, besides paying £140 a year, people must provide a valid MOT certificate, proof of insurance and the registration document to ensure that vehicles reach a minimum safety standard. It would be admirable if the Minister were introducing the regulations on the basis of road safety improvements as well as income maximisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with so many of the Government's transport policies, however, the effectiveness in this case is seriously diminished by the lack of an overall strategy for unlicensed vehicles. The possibilities for the nationwide implementation of such an extremely important scheme are remote as a consequence of the split between the civil and the criminal road traffic offences. That local authorities now have the power to enforce parking restrictions, because of their decriminalisation, means that they will not be able to carry out any of the proposals. That is my understanding, and I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm that or correct me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Failing to display a vehicle licence disc is a criminal offence and cannot, therefore, be enforced by local authorities. What, then, are the Government's long-term plans? Do they plan to establish a separate police force, authorised clamping or ticketing teams throughout the country, or to decriminalise VED offences? It is common sense that local authority parking attendants should be able to issue tickets for VED offences. The status of the attendants or the offence must change; only then can this scheme begin to reach its full potential. I should be grateful if the Minister would say a word or two about how that change will be effected, and whether he feels that it might be appropriate in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the regulations fail to tackle the serious safety threat posed by illegally operated heavy goods vehicles. A small proportion of lorry operators continue to put unsafe vehicles on the road, sometimes coercing their drivers into working dangerously long hours. The immobilising of vehicles for excise duty evasion is a starting point, but more important steps need to be taken to reduce the huge threat to road safety posed by some of those vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While lorries that fail to display their vehicle licence disc are liable to be immobilised—at least, they will be when the Government get large enough clamps—those being run by unlicensed operators will not be clamped. They do not have an operator's licence that allows them to put vehicles on the road. When an operator wants to start up a fleet, he must obtain an operator's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
licence for the number of trucks that he will run, but some operators choose to operate outside the law and run unlicensed trucks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a lorry is unlicensed, it is also likely to fail in other safety-critical areas, such as maintenance. Estimating the size of the unlicensed operation is difficult. It is rather like estimating the number of thieves in a particular city. Because such operators are outside any regulatory structure, it is difficult to know how many there are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister agreed to carry out a survey of 4,000 trucks to determine the number of unlicensed lorries on our roads. The figures were published in early February, but far from revealing the proportion of the 4,000 lorries which were unlicensed, the figures were based on the total number of kilometres travelled by the lorries in the United Kingdom every year. The figures show that 1.6 per cent.—473.6 million—of the total kilometres travelled by HGVs every year are travelled by unlicensed ones. In other words, nearly one in 60 kilometres travelled by lorries are travelled by unlicensed lorries. That in itself is a significant number. Far more revealing would be a straight percentage of unlicensed lorries out of the 4,000 surveyed. That figure has yet to be released. I hope that the Minister will tell us when that figure will be released, so that we can have a clearer idea of the scale of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other surveys. A former senioir licensing authority employee, Ronald Ashford, suggested that between 7 per cent. and 9 per cent. of lorries are unlicensed. A targeted check in March 1993, quoted in the 1994–95 Illegal Operations Working Group report, looked at 670 vehicles and found that 63, or 9 per cent., were unlicensed. A survey by the road safety research group BRAKE of more than 7,000 HGVs stopped at roadside checks found that one in 20—five per cent.—of lorries are unlicensed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been estimated that 500 lives lost on the United Kingdom's roads could have been due to unlicensed lorries. A disproportionately high number of vehicles involved in road accidents are unlicensed HGVs. Unlicensed operations represent a significant minority problem which needs to be urgently addressed. Seizing and impounding unlicensed lorries is the best way of making significant inroads into that problem. In that respect, we have the industry's support and I hope that the Minister will publish the wider figures and, with all-party support, take steps to improve the situation with regard to heavy goods vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I met the Minister in October, he was sympathetic and intimated that there was a possibility of future action. Impounding vehicles for VED offences is an important matter, which I hope can now be discussed openly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the VED scheme, checks are are carried out on the spot; if a vehicle is not displaying a tax disc, the police can obtain information immediately from the driver and vehicle licensing centre to discover whether the tax has been paid. Unbelievably, such a system does not operate in respect of HGVs operated by a licensed operator. Under the current system, not all
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
lorries are required to display the green "O licence" disc, so illegally operating vehicles cannot easily be identified. What is needed is a national register of licensed operators which can quickly and easily be updated with the registrations of their vehicles. That information must be immediately accessible to those with the authority to clamp or impound the illegally operated vehicles. There is a financial incentive, too. Customs and Excise officers can already impound HGVs found to be running on illegal "red" diesel and net the Exchequer thousands of pounds every year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Impounding unlicensed lorries will remove a significant danger from our roads. If there are the resources and the willingness to tackle the VED problem, what is there to stop the scheme being extended to vehicles that pose such a serious threat to road safety, rather than limiting it to those vehicles in the regulations, with a consequent effect on Treasury coffers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want any vehicle using the roads illegally to be liable to be clamped or impounded. According to the Minister's figures, a single road death costs £850,000. Even in crude financial terms, tougher enforcement of safety standards is therefore worthwhile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious about releasing the offending vehicles; that raises questions about the distinction between criminal and decriminalised offences. We are wholly in favour of toughening the enforcement of VED evasion measures, but the law must be applied fairly and evenly, and that is not so with the release fee for parking and VED offences. The release fee for a parking offence is currently £38—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am trying to listen to the hon. Gentleman and other hon. members should do so too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presumed that my remarks had created some discussion in the conservative ranks. I am sorry that you have disabused me of that idea, Mr. McWilliam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The release fee for a parking offence is £38; for a VED offence it is £68. Likewise, release from impounding after a parking offence is £105; for a VED offence it is £135. The difference cannot be designed to penalise the VED evader, because it is a release fee, not a penalty charge. As it is a criminal offence, VED evaders cannot, like parking offenders, be given a penalty charge. The extra £30 to release a vehicle impounded for a VED evasion seems to be a disguised way of making up the balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not in favour of letting offenders off lightly, but the difference shows the confusion that arises from the lack of a strategic overview and the problems that arise from the separation of criminal and non-criminal offences. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. the Minister is not excluded from my admonition to listen to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Minister was saying that the Conservative party was being soft on crime, as shown by the lower release fee for parking offences than for VED evasion—but he will be able to speak for himself in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Although people clamped for a parking offence can pay the charges over the telephone and wait for their vehicle, people clamped for vehicle excise duty evasion must go to the payment office. Perhaps the Minister can explain this, given that the vehicle may be released before a tax disc or any other documentation has been produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
VED evasion is a serious matter, and we want those who deliberately evade to be specifically targeted and dealt with. To my dismay, however, the Government's approach seems to be half hearted, and is merely another add-on to a rather ragged policy. We need a national strategy for tackling all illegally operated vehicles—cars, heavy goods vehicles or any other vehicles on the road. And while there may be a financial reward in recouping lost revenue, the primary focus must be on the road safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of immobilising offending vehicles is a good one but, to be effective, the whole country needs to be covered. The scheme must be expanded to include the impounding of unlicensed lorries. We must also take basic steps to create a register of HGV operators and their vehicles to ensure that the minority of rogue operators are put out of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Government to expand this limited and London-based project and to tackle the problems of road safety thoroughly and convincingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.46 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Transport in London (Mr. Steve Norris)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am on my mettle this afternoon, as I have behind me the most extraordinarily distinguished group of supporters, whose intellectual quotient rises by the minute. I note the late arrival of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Walden), and it gives me particular pleasure to have as my parliamentary private secretary, pro tem, my dear and right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Mr. Patten)—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is, as he says, a privilege and a pleasure for him to be with me this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also extend a welcome to the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Trickett). We know each other from local authority days. He is now about to experience the delights of membership of this House. He has already experienced one of them—a speech made by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen). I trust that I can relieve him of that tedium ere long in answering the questions posed by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, this is a pilot scheme because we need to sort out the administrative procedures. One of the interesting consequences of this excellent scheme to wheelclamp people who do not pay their vehicle excise duty is that we have located rather more vehicles which owners simply do not claim. A vehicle is removed, is retained for five weeks in the car pound and if not claimed is then scrapped. We estimated a proportion of vehicles that would fall into that category—interestingly, the proportion is higher than originally estimated. That is the kind of matter that needs to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
explored in a pilot scheme; we have to ensure that all the paperwork and procedures are in order and that we have both the technology and the strategy for dealing with the scheme's practical implementation. However, it is our intention to extend the scheme nationally as soon as we are sure that we have ironed out any problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we must also make sure that the scheme can be operated without causing any hazard to road safety. These days, operators, local authorities and the police are experienced when it comes to clamping: they know what techniques to use. I am sure that you have never had any personal experience of being clamped. Mr. McWilliam, so it might not be wise for you to indicate assent to this proposition, but you may know that police and dampers are expert at knowing how to avoid road safety difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It may help the Minister to know that I once had a licence disc fall off my car, because it was a posh one. I have used a cheap plastic one since then. Mr. Norris.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I appreciate the immediate juxtaposition of my name with cheap plastic imitations. Nevetheless, I appreciate your customary and characteristic honesty, Mr. McWilliam. It does you such credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, is this exercise simply about income maximisation? Well, it is and it is not. The general public are hugely irritated by the idea that 3 or 4 per cent. of motorists simply ignore the law and ignore the fact that whatever is not paid by them must be paid by other law-abiding taxpayers. I have been astonished by just how popular the scheme is. The number of people who have told me that they consider the scheme long overdue and an excellent idea is quite extraordinary. As the hon. Member for Nottingham, North said, we all want it to be extended as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I just want to make a point about vehicle excise duty. As the hon. Member for Nottingham, North and I have discussed on a previous occasion, collecting that tax is the one opportunity that we have in a year to check that there is an MOT certificate and a valid insurance certificate and to check the details of keepership on the document held by the DVLA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context it is also important not to fall into the dog licence trap—to make the amount of money involved so derisorily small that people simply ignore the process. VED has traditionally been set at a level that is a real charge but that, uniquely, allows us to check documentation in the most practical way available to us at this moment. We do not yet have a computerised system that might allow us not to have to check the documents individually.

That, in part, answers the question why it is not possible to make all payment arrangements over the telephone. When they are paying to have a car released for a normal parking offence, it is perfectly reasonable that the public should be offered a facility that they are offered in every other respect with credit cards—to pay over the telephone. However, when the case involves VED, the procedure associated with normal VED

acquisition will have to be gone through before a vehicle can be released; the authorities will want to see that there is a valid MOT certificate and certificate of insurance before issuing a licence.

On heavy goods vehicles, it is important to understand that in so far as they are covered by the VED regime—which they of course are—they are included in the scope of the pilot. It is quite right that we need to make sure that we have the right size of clamps and the right technology to deal with clamping HGVs. They will indeed be removed, and we shall monitor how that works. There is a world of difference, however, between that proposition and the proposition that we use the principle of impounding to deal with infractions against the operator licensing regime.

I have made it consistently clear that—rather by contrast with some of my predecessors—I greatly favour the concept of impounding. I, like the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, believe that there is a small—but significant in safety terms—number of operators who simply do not give a damn. They often operate in the tipper business. Their modus vivendi is to turn up at a large construction site and be paid cash to take away a load of slurry and not come back. They have no licences. They generally have a series of offences, such as bald tyres and bad maintenance, on the vehicle. They are untraceable once they are allowed to take the vehicle away. They generally have no fixed abode, and if they do give an address it is invariably out of date.

Those people are by no means a majority, and it is also fair to say that the proportion falling into that category has consistently been overestimated in anecdotal surveys, as opposed to the more scientific evidence, which suggests a much lower figure. None the less, I remain convinced that if it is of any statistical significance—and, as hon. Members will note, I am saying this very much for the record—we should pursue the concept of impounding. We should be aware, however, that impounding in such circumstances is a much more complex proposition than wheelclamping for VED evasion. The nature of the offence for which impounding would be appropriate, the type of vehicle and the status of the driver or operator would remain to be negotiated and agreed. I would hope that such an agreement might be on an all-party basis. The idea is extraordinarily important, but not strictly relevant to the regulations.

We do not need to decriminalise VED evasion to make the system work. It works perfectly well within the criminal law as it is. Many local authorities already use their reporting function to advise the DVLA of offences. There is one marvellous thing about wheelclamping. Many a Member of Parliament will have received a letter from an outraged constituent who says, "A dreadful pile of old rubbish is parked in my street. It is always there and it never has any tax.
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
The owner seldom seems to do anything with it, and every time I ask the local authority to get rid of it they say they have posted a notice saying that it was obviously abandoned, but the owner has popped up to say that it is not". That is terribly inadequate and frustrating. What will happen now is that after our people have advised the local authority to post a seven-day notice of its intention to treat the vehicle as abandoned, an owner who says that the vehicle is not abandoned will be told by us that it is not taxed and that we shall wheel clamp it. If it is still not claimed, we can remove it within 24 hours. Five hours later it can go into the crusher. That is a significant benefit and will be much appreciated, especially in urban areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that example, could not the local authority act immediately by calling in the police and telling them that the vehicle was unlicensed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our experience is that that is possible in theory but that in practice the procedure is tortuous. We have to follow up and engage the owner, rather than the registered keeper, engage in correspondence, often with people who claim that their addresses have changed, and more. We have had relatively little success in that area. I say that with no pride, but it is a statement of fact that everyone recognises. The wheel clamping exercise introduces an element of immediacy, which is vivid in people's minds, and will result in significant changes in behaviour, as the hon. Genetleman acknowledges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the answer is yes, the police could clamp the car immediately they were informed? To go one stage further, a member of the public could report a vehicle, and the police could arrive, find it had no licence and clamp it immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is technically true. However, local authorities have other powers to deal with abandoned vehicles, which are different from those that fail, or those such as that owned by the Chairman in which the tax disc slipped to the floor or some other thing that one has heard before and will, no doubt hear again, although seldom in such distinguised company.

The point about the level of charges is that the £68 charged to release a vehicle under the regime includes a penalty charge of £30. Under the VED scheme, the total release fee is £68. Releasing an impounded vehicle costs £135 under both schemes. Again, the penalty element of £30 applies only to the parking regime. In other words, the release fee is £105 plus £30. Storage and disposal charges are identical for both schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said at the beginning, and can end on the same note, that we must build costs into the scheme, as that is a strong element in the proportion of vehicles left out by their owners simply to be abandoned. Ironically, the higher the charge, the more likely the owner is to write off the damn thing and start again. If owners do that, we have to ensure that the costs of scrapping are contained within the overall costs of the scheme. I can

see no reason why any member of the public should pay a penny towards removing unwanted vehicles from our streets. Those who fall foul of the VED scheme will unquestionably pay a proportion of that cost, which is entirely right. Despite all the banter about who is tough on what, we all recognise that this imaginative scheme has sparked the public imagination. People like it. It is working extremely
