Merchant Shipping (Distress Signals and Prevention of Collisions) Regulations 1996</div> <!-- title -->
<p>4.30pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen <span class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Merchant Shipping (Distress Signals and Prevention of Collisions) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 75).</p></blockquote>
I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Sims.<br><br>
This may appear to be a very technical measure, but anyone in doubt about its importance should consult this morning's <i>Finanical Times</i> which sadly, but in a timely way, reported the losses of bulk carriers in the past six or so years. In his piece, Charles Batchelor said that 118 bulk carriers have been lost since 1990. That is a staggering figure. In that brief period 587 people died in 34 incidents involving loss of life. Not all those incidents were the result of collisions or of the failure of distress signals, but the <i>Financial Times</i> article states that strandings and collisions accounted for 83 per cent. of the losses in 1995, the last year for which figures are available. That is an appalling catalogue of statistics. No one could have imagined that the figure would be as high as 118 vessels lost. We might have estimated six or seven, including the Derbyshire and other high-profile cases. The percentage of losses due to strandings and collisions is also staggering. Those figures should underline how important are the matters we are considering, however dry and technical they may appear.<br><br>
The measure is a consolidation regulation; the current international regulations preventing collisions at sea were agreed in 1972. They have subsequently been amended four times and the amendments implemented each time by an order in the House. The orders to be revoked are listed in regulation 1(8) and the measure consolidates all the previous amendments to the international regulations. It also enables future amendments to international regulations agreed by the International Maritime Organisation to be made by a merchant shipping notice rather than by order, a form of deregulation. That is the dry, technical side of the measure.<br><br>
The sad fact remains that there are high casualties as a result of strandings and collisions in our major sea lanes. I repeat the shocking statistic of 118 bulk carriers alone lost since 1990; and 83 per cent. of those losses last year were due to strandings and collisions.<br><br>
I have several questions for the Minister; if he cannot answer them now I am sure that he will, as usual, write to us with his reply.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Regulation No. 5 allows the Secretary of State to exempt any ship or description of ships from all or any of the regulation's provisions. Will the Minister explain to the Committee when those wide-ranging extension powers may be used, because they can include
<br><blockquote><p>"the number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as … the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances if he"—</p></blockquote>
the Secretary of State—
<br><blockquote><p>"is satisfied that compliance with such provision is either impractical or unreasonable in the case of that ship or description of ships … he may specify … subject to giving reasonable notice"</p></blockquote>
an exemption from regulation No. 5. Those are wide-ranging powers. No doubt the Minister wishes to put on record the circumstances in which he might use them.<br><br>
It is essential that ship safety requirements be legislated for and implemented. Unfortunately the Government's deregulatory policy towards shipping has encouraged increased flagging out of British ships, and substandard shipping in United Kingdom waters, which is now causing serious concern. This point was raised by my hon. Friends recently in connection with the Sea Empress. Again I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger) for his incredibly expert and conscientious work as Pembroke's Member of Parliament throughout that disaster.<br><br>
I do not suggest that if the Sea Empress had been British flagged, British officered and staffed by British seafarers the accident would not have happened. What I do say is that there is a likelihood of accidents occurring because of vessels being flagged out, registered elsewhere and officered by people, including seafarers, from other countries. It has been proven statistically that such ships are less safe than British-flagged ships with British crews and officers. There is a longer-term cause for concern about the decline of the British merchant fleet which my hon. Friends will press until we halt, and reverse, the decline. That concern is shared throughout the industry—by the National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers, the officers union, by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, the seafarers union, and by the Chamber of Shipping, which represents shipping employers. The Government should address this matter, not least as a root cause of inadequate compliance with regulations covering distress signals and the prevention of collisions.<br><br>
Another matter that is pertinent in the context of the Sea Empress accident that turned into a disaster at Milford Haven is that of the resources given to agencies to ensure compliance with the regulations. I have in mind especially the Coastguard Agency and the Marine Safety Agency, whose expertise is being sliced away year by year. The Government may call it efficiency savings or redeployment, but such moves cannot but undermine in the longer term the sea police force of the coastguards and the safety agency which is responsible for safety in our waters and elsewhere. The Minister may wish to underline the fact that it is most
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0343">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
important that further reductions in the number and expertise, of coastguards especially, be ended, and that coastguards and the MSA be kept up to strength.<br><br>
Under regulation No. 6 the maximum penalty for non-compliance is £50,000. Of course, in practice, smaller fines are invariably imposed but these are not a sufficient deterrent for unscrupulous operators. Unfortunately, it is often cheaper for such people to bypass the regulations and risk a small fine than to implement them.<br><br>
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has published this year an interesting study entitled "Competitive advantages obtained by some shipowners as a result of non-observance of applicable international rules and standards", which highlights the problem in some detail. I am sure that the Minister is familiar with it, and I ask him to let the Committee know how he intends to overcome the problem of penalties being regarded merely as a cost of business.<br><br>
The OECD says:
<br><blockquote><p>"shipping is still largely a free market which allows considerable scope for shipowners to avoid compliance with internationally agreed rules and regulations as regards safety and the protection of the marine environment".</p></blockquote>
Does the Minister agree that he should take steps to ensure that the penalties are sufficient to deter people from regarding them merely as a cost of business and to make them take seriously the problems that they create?<br><br>
It is also a matter of concern that master of ships that contravene the regulations are targeted in regulation 6(1) and can be punished by imprisonment, when it is often the ship operators who let standards fall in order to cut costs. I urge the Minister to keep ship safety standards high by ensuring that ship operators are encouraged not to cut corners but to comply with distress signals and prevention of collision regulations so as to avoid heavy fines.<br><br>
I have raised four serious points for the Minister's consideration. I return from the rather dry wording of the regulations to say that, as we have seen in the case of the Sea Empress, real people are involved. There is a danger of loss of life and of disasters such as the terrible oil pollution that we have seen scarring the Welsh coastline, perhaps for many months to come, and destroying the marine environment, perhaps for many years to come.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will respond positively to the points that I and my hon. Friends will put to him.</span></p>
<p>4.42 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pendle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The regulations may seem as dry as dust, but they are of immense significance to mariners and people living on the coast. Earlier today I had a look at the annual report of the Coastguard Agency, because I wondered how many collisions there had been in British waters in the past year. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) mentioned the 118 bulk carriers lost since 1990—a dreadful figure.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
Here, in United Kingdom waters, there have been 37 collisions; 6 per cent. of all emergencies arose from collisions. My concern is that the Coastguard Agency and the marine pollution unit should be adequately resourced. It is worrying that in 1994–95 the Coastguard Agency employed 561 people, whereas in 1995–96 it employed 538. More people do not necessarily make a better service, but there is an obligation on the Minister to reassure us that the agency has the tools to do its job.<br><br>
We heard about the Sea Empress. Hindsight is a great thing, but from the reports published by the Coastguard Agency a couple of years ago we discover that the priority then was to station two tugs, one in Dover and one in the west of Scotland, despite the fact that Milford Haven is the place that brings in most of the country's oil for refining. We can now see the consequences of that decision.<br><br>
I am concerned about contingency plans. In his report, Lord Donaldson said that contingency plans should be drawn up by local authorities and the Coastguard Agency. I am particularly concerned about the possibility of collisions in the Dover straits and was surprised and disappointed to be told by the Library, which contacted the Coastguard on my behalf today, that the national contingency plan that Lord Donaldson recommended and which the Government drew up, is a secret document. Even Members of Parliament cannot have access to it. I want the Minister to respond to that.<br><br>
On the Dover straits, my main concern is that the business plan of the Coastguard Agency tells us that the Marine Safety Agency would:
<br><blockquote><p>"review arrangements for investigating and reporting infringements of the Dover Strait Traffic Separation Scheme and report to the Department's Shipping Policy Division by July 1995."</p></blockquote>
When the Minister replies, will he tell me what the Coastguard said about the Dover straits traffic separation scheme and give me his response to that?<br><br>
The Minister might also throw some light on something that appears in the latest publication from the next steps review. A section on the Coastguard deals with the Dover straits separation scheme and says that the target is to maintain a fully operational, 24 hour channel navigation information service covering the Dover strait traffic separation scheme. We are told that the availability is 98.5 per cent. If that is based on 365 days of the year, there are five days when the system does not work. There may be a simple explanation, that I have not grasped, but will the Minister explain the missing 1.5 per cent., which translates into five days in real time?<br><br>
When we discussed the Sea Empress three weeks ago, the Minister told us that everything was hunky-dory. But I do not want to stand here and talk about the problems of policing traffic in the Dover straits only to find in a month's time that there has been a disaster—that a ferry has gone down or there has been a collision involving an oil tanker. I do not want the Minister to dismiss these serious points; I want him to give me some answers.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0344">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
I also want the Minister to tell me, in detail, as he has had the information for some months, about the global maritime distress and safety system. I read that there are changes afoot, with a move to digital selective calling, using radio telephones on board ships. I gather that there may be some problems with recreational seafarers. One can imagine all sorts of things happening in the English channel if recreational seafarers have not tuned into the right frequency and so on. The Marine Safety Agency made proposals by December; the Minister will, therefore, be up to speed on them, as he is on all other matters, and I hope that he will tell me what he is doing.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North said, the document seems dry, but immensely important issues lie behind it. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us the answers that we require.</span></p>
<p>4.48 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not delay the Committee long. First, I should like to thank my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North for his kind words about my activities during the past two weeks; I only wish that I had not had to do what I have done, bearing in mind the huge environmental impact that the Sea Empress grounding and subsequent disaster has had on my local environment and local economy. We are only beginning to see the full impact of what is now acknowledged to be the greatest environmental disaster to befall the British coastline. Huge numbers of seabirds are already dead and many of those rescued are likely to die. There has already been an impact on local seals. The long-term impact on some of the most precious maritime habitats in the world has yet to be seen, but is likely to be serious.<br><br>
I shall not dwell at length on the reasons why individuals and organisations were able to turn an accident, which happened on the night of Thursday 15 February and resulted in a spillage of 250 tonnes of oil, into a disaster, in which 65,000 tonnes of oil were spilt by the following Monday night. An inquiry is going into that, but my constituents, many other hon. Members—including some Conservative Members—and I believe that it would have been better for the Government, my constituency, and the oil and shipping industries if a truly independent inquiry had been set up. Like Lord Donaldson's inquiry into the Braer disaster, the inquiry should have been independent of the Department of Transport. I do not wish to make derogatory remarks about the objectivity, integrity or capability of the marine accident investigation branch of the Department of Transport, but some matters are beyond its capability, for example, salvage law. The MAIB does not have the same expertise in the subject as Lord Donaldson.<br><br>
We do not want to revisit in detail the issues that were raised in Lord Donaldson's inquiry, but several of his recommendations have not been fully implemented. I draw particular attention to the salvage tug that should have been available in the western approaches.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not delay my hon. Friend. The inquiry as constituted will find it difficult to examine the most important problem—the conduct of Ministers, who seemed to take the advice of the salvage team without giving it deep consideration. Advice should be considered, not simply swallowed whole. As my hon. Friend pointed out, the salvage team's failure to bring in the two heavy tugs turned an accident into a disaster.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I allowed the hon. Member for Pembroke to make his point because I appreciate his constituency interest. I remind the Committee, however, that we are considering distress signals and the prevention of collisions. I hope that the hon. Member will now concentrate on the regulations rather than, understandably, reflecting on other matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your advice, Mr. Sims. I shall shortly return to the delegated legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, very shortly. A point that must be made in relation to the grounding of the Sea Empress and the regulations is the way in which regulations are implemented in the shipping industry. My hon. Friends the Members for Nottingham, North and for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) made points about staffing levels in the Marine Safety Agency, which is the police force for regulations such as those that we are considering. Cuts in the coastguard service have an impact on our coastline. We expect port authorities to operate sensibly and responsibly. Yet we learn that, not only in the case of the Sea Empress, but in the grounding of the Borga on 29 October, the rada that covers the port entrance had been out of action since September and often did not operate—it kept breaking down because it had become clapped out through being used for longer than its 10-year lifespan. It is fine to have regulations, but there is no point in them if they are not properly enforced. We can agree to regulations in the House, but if there are not enough people to implement them, it is an empty exercise. There are lessons to be learned, in particular from Lord Donaldson's recommendations after the Braer disaster, which have not been implemented.<br><br>
I should like the Minister to clarify a number of points. The first concerns radar cover, which is what we really mean when we talk about separation zones. We are talking not about people sitting on the top of a high tower with a pair of binoculars, but sitting in front of radar screens. It is not just the Dover straits, as there are other separation zones, such as the one in the Irish sea. It is difficult to have proper radar cover in that area because it is a significant distance off the shore. If there is a full traffic separation zone, particularly in the case of the St. George's channel between the coast of Pembrokeshire and south-east Ireland, how is it policed and covered?<br><br>
Statements have already been made in public by Lord Donaldson about his recommendation that not just three salvage tugs, but five should have been in place, ideally by now. Presumably, that was dependent
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0345">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
upon the emergency towing report, which was delivered to the Coastguard Agency in June 1995. My office and that of the shadow Secretary of State for Wales have asked if a copy can be placed in the House, but we have been told that it is awaiting publication and printing. That is from June 1995, I remind the Committee. Will that report be made available? Can we be assured that a salvage tug will now be in place, not just in the western approaches, and that two other tugs will also be placed around our coast? That will take us up to five. Will the contracts for the two existing heavy salvage tugs in Stornoway and the Dover straits be renewed after the end of this winter? My understanding is that, by that time, they will be off charter.<br><br>
Can I again urge the Minster to look at the staffing level of the Marine Safety Agency to ensure that, when we pass regulations, they can be fully endorsed. My understanding is that the officer responsible for checking vessels in and out of Milford Haven is also responsible for virtually every other port in south Wales. With 3,000–3,500 movements in and out of Milford Haven, plus the movements in and out of Swansea, Port Talbot, Barry, Cardiff and Newport, is it possible for one individual to keep a proper check on the vessels? I suggest that it is not. Is cover available from Bristol? I urge the Minister to check up on that. It does not matter how good the regulations are if they are not properly enforced. Sadly, the shipping industry has a record of trying to avoid regulations wherever possible. I am afraid that we have seen the consequences of that. I say that, not in relation to the Sea Empress, but to other disasters. The Braer was a good example of a vessel that should not have been at sea given the condition that it was in.</span></p>
<p>4.58 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I adopt the points made so well by my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke. Had I been called before him I would have paid tribute to him as my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North did, for the assiduous way in which he has carried out his constituency duties, going well beyond what would be expected of a local Member of Parliament and learning thoroughly about the complexities.<br><br>
I thank you, Mr. Sims, for allowing us perhaps a little more latitude than is normal, as a result of the tragedy that has overwhelmed the coast of south-west Wales. I know the area very well. It is a constituency that has been hit extremely hard by defence cuts, has relatively low-paid employment but has some of the finest coastline in the country. I know the extent of the blow, not just to the fishing industry but to tourism in the area. I see it only from the margins, as I live on the shores of Swansea bay, with the promenade and sea just in front of my home. Happily, the tide of oil has not quite reached Swansea bay, having stopped at Port Eynon point, but birds have been washed up in Rhosili bay.<br><br>
Nowadays, we can talk about safety at sea, as we do with these regulations, only in the context of the Sea Empress. My hon. Friend the Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Nottingham, North talked of enforcement, making me think of those grand words that trip off the tongues of Ministers, such as down-sizing and efficiency savings. As with insurance policies, which show their worth only when there is a fire, theft or whatever, the regulations show their worth only when there is a tragedy such as the Sea Empress.<br><br>
One of the sadder elements of that tragedy has been the clear evidence that certain skippers are discharging oil at sea, taking the opportunity to add to the mess around our coasts. That only goes to prove that, in a area such as the safety of shipping, our regulations must be extremely carefully drawn. Certain rogue skippers—not the generality—will seek to exploit any loophole for their own benefit and will cut corners if they can. One must be careful to ensure, not only that the regulations can be enforced as my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North said, but that penalties are adequate and will not be written off as business costs.<br><br>
Is the Minister confident that the penalties constitute a deterrent to those who might be minded to cut corners? How frequently are they reviewed? It is perhaps unfair to ask how frequently the penalties go to the maximum, but, if he has the figures at his fingertips, what is the average penalty? Such questions might be brought before the House.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North commented that the statutory instrument, in addition to its consolidation, is a form of deregulation. In future, amendments to international regulations agreed by the International Maritime Organisation will be made by merchant shipping notice and would not, therefore, come before the House or a Committee. I certainly agree that the business of the House is over-clogged with detail and I normally rejoice when things are cleared from the table to let us get down to matters of greater concern. But certain revisions of regulations, such as penalties and additional safety matters that are made all the more important by tragedies such as the Sea Empress, should properly be brought before the House. I accept that such matters may be limited and even that there may not be any, but there should be some facility to allow the House to review the adequacy of regulations rather than making a blanket move to accept all those that are accepted by the IMO.<br><br>
I confess that, in reading the regulations, I have not fully understood the import or ambit of the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North. Perhaps the Minister can tell us whether it will be possible for amendments to regulations that are likely to interest hon. Members to be brought before us. In general, I am ready to consider means of sweeping away some of the things that come before Committees, but we should have a fall-back position.<br><br>
At first sight, the regulations are technical. All of us are amateurs in some respects, and the initial response is to leave things to the experts; but alas, as in the case of the Sea Empress, they can be wrong, sometimes monumentally wrong. It is the job of this House to question the experts and, as my hon. Friend said, to question a Government that may be so hell-bent on

cutting costs that they do not provide the protection that our coastlines and mariners deserve and should be given.</span></p>
<p>5.05 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. Steve Norris)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise in advance to my hon. Friends, who have been extraordinarily patient, for the length of my response to the various matters raised. As you pointed out, Mr. Sims, we are discussing Merchant Shipping (Distress Signals and Prevention of Collisions) Regulations 1996, about which we have not heard a great deal. We have heard much about the Sea Empress, and the hon. Member for Nottingham, North predictably managed to mention the Herald of Free Enterprise and the Estonia. If I may use a maritime metaphor, it is necesary for me to cover the waterfront when responding to debates of this kind, but I shall deal with matters as expeditiously as possible.<br><br>
First, it is important that collision regulations or COLREGS, as I believe they are known—my hon. Friends will be able to quote that at dinner and cocktail parties—be kept up to date. They were developed in 1863 by the then Board of Trade, working with the French Government. We have to keep pace with changes in technology, such as the use of radar and the new types of craft. As the hon. Member for Nottingham, North said, the last significant revision of COLREGS was in 1972. The COLREGS are the basic rules of the road for mariners. They govern the behaviour of all vessels, regardless of their type and size. They establish rules about which vessels have the right of way, who should take action to avoid a collision, and what lights, sound and distress signals should be used.<br><br>
The Merchant Shipping (Distress Signals and Prevention of Collisions) Regulations 1996 fulfil our international obligations. They bring into effect in United Kingdom law the latest amendments to the COLREGS agreed by the International Maritime Organisation in November 1993. They allow a pragmatic application of the mast light rules for smaller craft, improve the visibility of all-round lights, recognise the special construction characteristics of the new generation of high-speed craft, and specify special signals for small fishing vessels and trawlers.<br><br>
As hon. Members know, the Government are keen to consolidate existing legislation wherever possible. I can tell the Hon. Member for Swansea, East that in line with that approach, we have used the 1996 statutory instrument to revoke no fewer than seven sets of earlier regulations dealing with minor COLREGS amendments since 1972. The detailed rules hae been removed from the regulations, and as the hon. Gentleman said, we have used the merchant shipping notice to update them.<br><br>
It may reassure hon. Members to learn that that approach, which has been used in other merchant shipping legislation for many years, will simplify the arrangements for incorporating future amendments to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
the COLREGS. The hon. Member for Nottingham North was right to say that the House is clogged up with regulations, and those future amendments which will be brought into effect by merchant shipping notice will reflect exactly decisions reached by the International Maritime Organisation. They will also be discussed fully with the shipping industry and others before their publication.<br><br>
When we are dealing with matters which are for the British Parliament to determine—that is, those which go beyond the decisions of the IMO—the House clearly must, and will, be involved in the process.<br><br>
The merchant shipping notice approach has other advantages. It allows for the physical division of detailed technical requirements into areas of specialisation and makes it possible for the industry to direct and manage those technical areas more efficiently and more conveniently. I hope that that is the answer that the hon. Gentleman was seeking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I accept what the Minister said about simplification, de-clogging and the division between the notices and matters that may come before the House, but there may be matters—I mentioned penalties, for example—about which Members of Parliament feel legitimate concern. Are we saying that, in future, penalties can be imposed only as a result of IMO regulations and that the House will be bypassed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks. The penalties are contained in the Act. The regulations contain the details, with which, as the hon. Gentleman quite rightly said, we should not clog the House. Reference has already been made to the instant expertise that hon. Members seem to acquire on almost every subject under the sun. They might usefully use that expertise in other areas, rather than on such extremely technical matters.<br><br>
We are determined to deal with the enforcement of the collision regulations. We follow up alleged contraventions and foreign ships are formally reported to their flag states and their owners. For United Kingdom vessels, the Marine Safety Agency takes legal advice about the merits of prosecution and instigates proceedings when there is a good chance of a successful prosecution. In a recent case, for example—the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger) will be interested to know—a master was fined £1,000 for failing to keep a proper look-out.<br><br>
I want to deal with the question of fine levels. Hon. Members might find it useful to look at the regulations themselves. They will see that in regulation 6(1) offences can be treated either on indictment or on summary conviction. On indictment, for the more serious offence, the punishment can be a prison term "not exceeding two years", as well as a fine. That answers the point raised by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North. On summary conviction there is the £50,000 fine and
<br><blockquote><p>"in any other case.… a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0347">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
In almost every matter in which courts are involved, a maximum fine is set by Parliament and the court decides within that limit. I cannot in all honesty tell the hon. Member for Nottingham, North what the average fine is or the number of fines that have been exacted, but I can tell him that £50,000—which the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) referred to as "a cost of business"—represents an extremely severe penalty for the activity that is being contemplated. That would of course be truer at the maximum than at any other figure. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North is right about that, but he knows that such a situation is not in any sense unique to the regulations.<br><br>
Where the density of traffic is greatest, we take a proactive monitoring role. In 1993, we invested £4 million to update radar surveillance equipment monitoring traffic in the busy Dover strait where, as the hon. Member for Pendle mentioned, the traffic separation scheme is in operation. We recognise the need to speed up the way in which the Coastguard and Marine Safety Agencies deal with reported contraventions of the rules. Both agencies are actively considering how best to take the matter forward in the context of their 1996–97 business plans. We should also remember that CNIS works extremely well. Contraventions are spotted, reports are made and the rule breakers are dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister assure the Committee that every vessel that is spotted contravening for example, the Dover straits separation scheme, is identified and prosecuted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that each vessel that contravenes regulations is necessarily identified and followed up, but I can say that the overwhelming majority most certainly are. To give him some idea, our very detailed monitoring of the Dover straits provided evidence that there may be about three contraventions out of perhaps 440 ship movements daily. On that basis we feel that the system allows us to detect contraventions and follow them up. I am sure that the hon. Member for Pembroke understands that it would be unwise of me to assure him in absolute terms, but we are satisfied that the system works extremely well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We raised this point not least because of the International Association of Dry Cargo Shipowners report—Intercargo—which referred us to the OECD report. This is not a few people making up things but the OECD itself, which feels that, if there is no adequate enforcement, the 95 per cent. of people who do abide by the law will think about the 5 per cent. and say, "Why shouldn't we do this? Why shouldn't we discharge our oil when there is a pollution incident? Why should we have proper distress operations on our vessels?" They question why they should go to the extent of taking the avoidable action that my hon. Friend spoke about.<br><br>
The OECD's report was entitled "Competitive advantages obtained by some shipowners as a result of non-observance of applicable international rules and standards". With respect to the Minister, whose statistics are, I am sure accurate, that does not sound
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
like a problem that affects two or three vessels every now and then: it is an issue of such significance that the major employers association and the OECD feel it should be taken extremely seriously—and the latter has written a lengthy report about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not go over the ground again. My hon. Friends' patience has been severely tried but they are a generous and distinguished group and it is good to see them here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nice of them to come!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. As the hon. Member for Swansea, East has observed from a sedentary position, it is extremely nice of them to come—although action by my hon. Friend the Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin), the enforcer, may partly explain their motivation.<br><br>
If occasional rule breakers are not identified—for example, at night, or in poor visibility when spotter planes cannot be used—we will be all the more keen to enforce the collision regulations by advancing two of Lord Donaldson's recommendations specifically to improve vessel identification. The first is to press the International Maritime Organisation for the early compulsory introduction of automatic ship identification transporters. We are taking practical steps to demonstrate their value. The MSA is undertaking trials in the Dover straits of a workable system based on existing VHF radio technology, which are proving successful. The agency is now considering how best to extend the trial to other parts of the United Kingdom coast.<br><br>
In answer to the point about the global marine distress and safety system—the GMDSS—we are determined to implement it fully by 1 February 1999, the planned date, and are actively encouraging all sea users, including the leisure sailor, to participate in the new radio system in the next century. Safety will be enhanced considerably if everyone uses the same system, especially in distress and emergency circumstances when help can be called at the touch of a button.<br><br>
The second Donaldson recommendation to go forward is, as the Committee is aware, our proposal to the IMO that ships display their call signs prominently on their sides. This proposal will be discussed at the May meeting of the IMO's maritime safety committee. We share Lord Donaldson's view that this is a straightforward and inexpensive way of removing the anonymity of ships. We have no argument with the hon. Member for Nottingham, North when he says that in this area, as ever, there is a temptation for a few to try to evade regulations. But the hon. Member accepts—he has often said so—that the enforcement procedure in British regulations are as stringent as any in the northern hemisphere, if not the world.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Nottingham, North asked about exemptions. If, for example, the MSA can be satisfied that safety will not be compromised, and that the spirit of the regulations will be fulfilled by a shorter distance between masthead lights, or an alternative height for the sidelights, when the ship's construction necessitates that, an exemption could be allowed. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0348">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
hon. Gentleman suggested that regulation No. 5 was widely drawn. I welcome the opportunity to put on record that it is to be used only when the construction of the vessel determines that an exemption might be made.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to making the operator the guilty party. Regulation 6(1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where any of these Regulations is contravened, the owner of the vessel, the master and any person for the time being responsible for the conduct of the vessel shall each be guilty of an offence".</p></blockquote>
As the hon. Gentleman generously suggested, that covers his point.<br><br>
I have dealt with most of the points that were raised in the debate. With the greatest respect to the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, I shall not go over the old tired ground of efficiency savings in the MSA and the Coastguard Agency. For those who are not familiar with our weekly trip around the lighthouse, we have debated the subject extensively—I nearly said "ad nauseam", but that would be inappropriate, because I am not a good sailor. It has been established beyond peradventure, and in the words of the chief executives of both agencies, that none of the efficiency savings have had any impact on safety. It is appalling that Opposition Members are tempted to claim that any efficiency saving is at the expense of safety. It is not, and it will not be in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said he had tackled all the substantive issues, but I remind him of my point about the national contingency plan. If we had had access to it before the Sea Empress disaster, my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke and others would have realised that there were no plans to station a heavy duty tug in Milford Haven. It is unsatisfactory that the national contingency plan, which Lord Donaldson recommended, should be kept not only from the public but Members of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As ever, I am generous about such matters, but the point is not especially germane to the regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Porter <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wirral, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nothing to do with them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, as my hon. Friend says, it has nothing to do with the regulations. As Conservative Members know, you are a generous soul, Mr. Sims, and we are grateful. Opposition Members can distinguish latitude from longitude though few of them knew their port from their starboard a week or so ago.<br><br>
First, let me deal with the availability of tugs. Lord Donaldson recommended that two heavy tugs should be stationed in the Minches and the Dover strait. They are there. As for Milford Haven, the hon. Member for Pendle apparently knows more about such matters than Lord Donaldson—the streets of Pendle must be alive with the buzz about the location of tugs around our coast. I believed that the people of Pendle were more worried about protecting their bus company, but that is another matter.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
When the marine accident investigation branch reports, it will no doubt wish to look at issues like the deployment of tugs. The hon. Member for Pembroke has monitored the situation in his consitutency with considerable and commendable assiduity. I know that the entire Committee will wish to commend him for that. He will therefore know that heavy tugs were on offer to the salvors within hours of the incident. Offers of particular vessels were made and either accepted or rejected as the salvors, one of the most experienced firms in the world, determined.<br><br>
In due course it may well emerge that decisions were made which should not have been made. But it would be quite inappropriate for me to say more than that. I know that the hon. Gentleman is wise enough not to fall into this trap even though some of his hon. Friends may wish to rush in where fools would wish to rush. We need to know much more from the inquiry before we conclude that any of those mistakes were attributable to particular parties. Going down that path is a temptation to be avoided.<br><br>
The independence of the MAIB is not in question. It reports to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. It is paid for out of the privy purse, but I doubt whether Opposition Members would wish it to be privatised. It is an interesting idea which I shall certainly take back. The MAIB will report, and if the conduct of Ministers or particular ministerial decisions need to be called into question, the Committee has every reason to believe that at no point will the MAIB be prevented or deterred informally or formally, from making whatever recommendations that it sees fit.<br><br>
On the point about the MAIB's competence in marine salvage law, the finest salvage lawyers in the world are available to it. If it wants to take advice on a particular point of salvage law it is perfectly able to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that the Minister wants to conclude, but two points should be made. First, I do not want him to appear to have misled the Committee. In chapter 20 on page 27, Lord Donaldson's report makes it clear that he is making a recommendation to the Government that by the winter of 1994–95 three tugs should be in place. That is a priority. There should be one in the Dover straits, one covering the Minches and one covering the western approaches. That is the first point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Kenneth Carlisle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lincoln)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Sims. I am trying to see which paragraph this relates to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Member that I am too. I hope that the hon. Member for Pembroke will keep his comments to the regulations. I have given him some latitude.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your advice, Mr. Sims. I was merely responding to a point made by the Minister. I was giving him the opportunity to make sure that the Committee was well aware of what Lord Donaldson said about three tugs, not two.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0349">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
The Minister went to great lengths to ensure that the Committee was aware of the independence of the marine accident investigation branch. If the final report produced by the MAIB is to be credible, the hundreds, if not thousands, of my constituents who are affected, and those of other hon. Members must have confidence in it. If Lord Donaldson was called in to conduct the Braer inquiry, why will the Secretary of State for Transport not do exactly the same for the Sea Empress? That is what my constituents cannot understand. It would give the report greater credibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not try my hon. Friend's patience—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or mine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or, far more importantly, yours Mr. Sims. I shall simply say that I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about the salvage tug arrangements. No doubt he will take the opportunity to raise it at any parliamentary opportunity.<br><br>
Far more to the point is the status of the marine accident investigation branch inquiry. It is charged with investigations of that sort for the Department and it is entirely appropriate for it to undertake that inquiry. Lord Donaldson was charged with quite a different task following the Braer disaster and had a much wider remit on which we do not wish to expand today.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not seek to discredit the marine accident investigation branch, and it would be untypical of him to do so. I have not the slightest doubt—indeed, no one with experience of Government would ever doubt—that such a body will produce a first class and independent report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we leave that point, Lord Donaldson recommended three—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the hon. Gentleman to keep his comments to the regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In order to prevent collisions and other mishaps at sea, Lord Donaldson recommended having three tugs around the coast. One was to be on the western approaches. When the Borga ran aground in October, there was no third tug in the western approaches. When the Sea Empress ran aground in February, there was no third tug in the western approaches. Will the Minister tell us if there is a third tug in the western approaches today, or have we still not learnt the two disastrous lessons of recent months?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The regulations are about distress signals and the prevention of collisions. They are about ships that collide with each other. If we want to talk about groundings or have a debate on the Braer or the Sea Empress, I am sure that my hon. Friends will be happy to have one in due course. I have answered the question that the hon. Gentleman raised. The matter can perfectly properly be considered by the marine accident investigation branch. Donaldson's words are written. I have made my statement on the availability of tugs and, naturally, I stand by it. If the inquiry board wishes to come to a different conclusion in due course, no doubt it will.<br><br>
I am conscious of the tremendous good will that my hon. Friends have extended to me today; I fear that I have exhausted it and have called in far too many markers from them. I commend the regulations.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
