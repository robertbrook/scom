	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Raymond S. Robertson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Criminal Legal Aid (Scotland) (Prescribed Proceedings) Amendment Regulations 1996.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Advice and Assistance (Assistance by Way of Representation) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 1996, the draft Advice and Assistance (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1996 and the draft Civil Legal Aid (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1996.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair and congratulate you on your appointment to the Chairman's Panel, Mr. Stewart. Since I came to the House, I have become accustomed to your growls of encouragement from the Front and Back Benches, but I shall have to cope without them today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to convey tha apologies of my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Scottish Office, for not being present in the Committee. He is accompanying Her Royal Highness the Princess Royal to Yorkhill to visit everyone who was involved in last week's tragic events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations provide for the uprating of financial eligibility limits for civil legal aid and for advice and assistance. They extend the availability of assistance by way of representation—which is a form of advice and assistance—and amend the time scale within which applications that cover assistance by way of representation may be made. The changes that the regulations propose are entirely straightforward and raise no new points of principle. It might be useful if I briefly describe each of the regulations in a little more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Civil Legal Aid (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1996 revise the financial eligibility limits for civil legal aid applications. They raise the lower disposable income limits for civil legal aid—below which civil legal aid is available without contribution by the assisted person—from £2,425 to £2,498 a year. They increase the upper limit—above which civil legal aid is not available—from £7,920 to £8,158 a year. The regulations also increase the capital eligibility limit—which is disregarded in calculating a person's financial position—from £6,750 to £8,560 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The proposed changes generally represent a three per cent. uprating on the 1995–96 eligibility levels. They therefore match increases in the level of income-related social security benefits. The new capital limit represents, however, a significantly greater uprating than three per cent. That will equate, like the upper income limit, to that which currently applies to personal injury cases in England and Wales. The change will improve the existing position, whereby personal injury cases are relatively disadvantaged in Scotland as compared to England and Wales, through having no separate and higher upper limit. It will also bring a small additional number of people within the scope of civil legal aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft Advice and Assistance (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1996 provide for financial eligibility increases in relation to advice and assistance. In advice and assistance cases, the calculation is carried out on the basis of weekly income. The regulations raise the lower limit from £64 to £67, and the upper limit from £156 to £162. They also revise the scale of contributions for applicants with disposable income between the upper and lower income limits for advice and assistance. The changes represent a 3.9 per cent. uprating on the 1995–96 levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft Advice and Assistance (Assistance by Way of Representation) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 1996 propose two changes. First, they extend the availability of assistance by way of representation to cover forfeiture or confiscation proceedings under the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1995. That Act allows for proceedings for the return of equipment or property that is forfeited or confiscated in certain circumstances. Assistance by way of representation is the most straightforward means to ensure that legal aid is available in relation to such proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second change reflects a commitment that was announced in our 1994 White Paper "Firm and Fair". At present, an accused person who is not in custody has and who wishes to change his plea to one of guilty must apply for assistance by way of representation within 14 days. That limit appears to discourage people from using assistance by way of representation instead of the more complex and expensive criminal legal aid. The proposed change removes any time limit for making such an application. That is intended to encourage use of assistance by way of representation rather than criminal legal aid by those who change plea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed change in the draft Criminal Legal Aid (Scotland) (Prescribed Proceedings) Amendment Regulations 1996 is consequential on extending assistance by way of representation to forfeiture and confiscating proceedings. Given that assistance by way of representations will be available for such proceedings, it is proposed to exclude them from eligibility for criminal aid. That will avoid duplication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also laid before the House three sets of regulations under the negative resolution procedure. The most significant change that they propose is the extension of free advice and assistance in certain circumstances to meet our obligation under the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0365">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
European judgements convention. They also strengthen rules to prevent abuse of civil legal aid and contain further minor, technical amendments which are required and which will improve the legal aid system in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations provide for useful improvements to the system of legal aid in Scotland and for the uprating of eligibility limits. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.35 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the Minister, I also welcome you, Mr. Stewart, to the Chair. From the Back Benches I am accustomed to your growls—I had better say no more. However, my welcome is genuine and I know that you will be firm and fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, I welcome the regulations and have only one or two comments to make. A few anxieties remain about the criminal procedure. Applications under sections 91, 92 and 93 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1995 have been removed from the main criminal legal aid system and are to be assessed more strictly under the advice and assistance system. It is possible that, as a result, many people will be excluded from access to legal aid that would have been available to them under the former criminal legal aid system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general upratings of benefits under the civil legal aid system are welcome. However, the Minister will know that an eligibility crisis remains and is not getting any better. A number of applications for civil legal aid have been referred to my by the Scottish Legal Aid Board. At last year's Law Society of Scotland conference at Gleneagles, Lord Gill said that the civil legal aid system was in crisis and that something had to be done. I cannot but agree with that when I consider the applications that have been referred to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first example involves an action for access. A woman with an income of £136 net per week plus child benefit was asked to contribute £1,236. A number of solicitors are proceeding on a speculative basis: if they succeed in getting an action dismissed, they seek payment out of the legal aid fund under the provisions relating to successful, unassisted persons in actions raised by assisted persons. However, the contributions factor often deters people, especially women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second example involves divorce. A person receiving invalidity benefit of £75 a week and a single parent benefit of £65 was asked to make a contribution of £900. That was a straightforward, uncontested divorce case, brought after five years of non-cohabitation. The fee for the action was paid privately, and the solicitors agreed significantly to restrict their fee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not name the person involved in the third example. She applied for an interim interdict—a power of arrest, divorce and custody. Her wage was £107 a week, and she was asked to make a contribution of £652. The solicitors proceeded under the emergency legal aid regulations, on the basis that the client would be eligible for a full certificate. She was unable to pay the contributions and the certificate was refused. A
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
divorce writ had already been raised and interim orders obtained: as a result, the client was unable to pay the solicitors' account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could go on, but it is clear that the eligibility crisis is deepening. It is very worrying that many people—especially women— are denied the access to the law that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the civil legal aid statistics contained in appendix 3 of the most recent Legal Aid Board annual report. One table contains an analysis of full applications where no legal aid was granted at first instance. I refer the Committee to the column headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"refused after offer of legal aid".</p></blockquote>
In 1993–94 in the Court of Session, 45 applications were refused after offer of legal aid. In 1994–95, the figure rose to 105—it more than doubled. In the sheriff court, 2,395 applications were refused and that figure rose to 2,888. In total, refusals have increased from 2,440 to 2,984. That is a worrying trend. Perhaps the Minister could take it up with the Legal Aid Board and explain why that worrying trend is increasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The uprating of benefits must be welcomed. On the draft Advice and Assistance (Assistance by Way of Representation) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 1996, and the confiscation proceedings, the Minister has the Opposition's support. We gave our support on the Floor of the House and we are happy that the element has been included in the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.41 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too welcome and congratulate you on your new position, Mr. Stewart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Payments for civil legal aid in Scotland appear to have increased from more than £27 million in 1993–94 to more than £30 million in 1994–95. Has there been a corresponding increase in the number of applicants? In other words, how many people received legal aid in 1993–94 and in 1994–95?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) that there is still great concern about the plight of many who apply for legal aid but who are unable to proceed with their cases. As the hon. Gentleman said, women on vary low incomes are particularly affected. The hon. Gentleman cited some examples and I have another which especially worried me: a woman seeking a divorce and custody of her children was on family credit and had to make a contribution of £850. She was unable to do that so was unable to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further great anxiety involves women subject to domestic violence. Even when they can obtain legal aid, they often have to juggle choices—taking proceedings or providing food, light and heat for themselves and their children. We need to know how many people who apply for legal aid are granted it, but then abandon it because they cannot afford the contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the costs have increased because court dues were substantially increased in 1993. I suppose that there is also an argument about solicitors' charges, but I am aware that not all solicitors are sharks and that many charge no fee at all or reduce it substantially if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0366">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
they feel that they can help. There is no doubt that the bottom line is that too many people are still denied access to justice—that is demonstrated in my constituency postbag.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.43 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond S. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Members for Dumbarton and for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) for their general welcome of the regulations. In setting the level of legal aid contributions payable by assisted persons, the Government must bear in mind the principle that the most needy should receive the help that they require. We also believe, however, that those who can afford to make a contribution to the cost of their cases should be required to do so. Any contribution level which a legally aided person is required to pay depends on that person's disposable income. All sources of income are considered when making the calculation. In some circumstances, people whose disposable income falls just within eligibility for civil legal aid will have to pay a substantial contribution. That simply reflects the fact that resources available for expenditure on legal aid have to be targeted as efficiently as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the hon. Gentleman's point on assistance by way of representation, the scheme is tailor made to suit those proceedings that are straightforward in character but which nevertheless require court appearances. Assistance by way of representation is a type of advice and assistance which is administered by solicitors and which involves less expensive paperwork—a factor that is much appreciated by the legal profession. The streamlined procedures also delegate to solicitors decisions on eligibility, which means that they can be taken on application and an immediate start on the relevant work can be made, which is much appreciated by the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned appendix 3 of the Scottish Legal Aid Board annual report and asked why more people were abandoning actions after an offer of legal aid. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will take that up with the board. There could be several reasons for it, but I will ensure that my hon. Friend writes to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute asked how many applications for legal aid there were in 1993–94. There was a reduction in the number of applications for civil legal aid between those two years, from 32,470 to 30,597.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
The hon. Lady's final point concerned those on social security benefit. Questions have been raised on the subject of automatic eligibility for civil legal aid for recipients of family credit, but I see no prospect of pursuing such a possibility. Family credit is a supplementary allowance that is designed to subsidise the extra costs that are incurred by those on low incomes with family responsibilities. In the Government's opinion, it would be wrong to exempt people who are in receipt of family credit from the means test for civil legal aid which applies to those without family responsibilities on the same basic level of income. The calculation for advice and assistance is a different matter, since the rules, which are operated by individual solicitors, need to be as simple as possible and cannot include the fairly complex calculations of disregard that are provided for in relation to civil legal aid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
