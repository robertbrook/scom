Public Service Vehicles (Operators' Licences) Regulations 1995</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.35 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen <span class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,<br><br>
That the Committee has considered the Public Service Vehicles (Operators' Licences) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995, No. 2908).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to consider the Public Service Vehicles (Operators' Licences) (Fees) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995, No. 2909).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Transport in London (Mr. Steve Norris)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Committee, may I say that I am delighted that you are here, Mr. Hill? Since we are here at the Oppositions bidding, perhaps the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) will make his case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The regulations that we are considering give the Minister another opportunity to make important life-saving changes in the system of licensing public service vehicles. I hope that our proceedings will differ from last week's debate on heavy goods vehicles, and that the Minister will consider seriously the sincere representations that we received about the issue.<br><br>
Many organisations contacted me about the regulations, including the Suzy Lamplugh Trust—Suzy's mother, Diana Lamplugh, wrote to me today. I was also contacted by Mrs. Margaret McGowan of the Advice Centre for Education, Angela Glaiser of Kidscape, BUSK—the Belt Up School Kids Campaign, which is led by Pat Harris—Jill Keys and John Hall from Childline and Mr. Brian Middleton.<br><br>
I shall briefly describe Mr. Middleton's case, which will put my remarks in context. Brian Middleton's daughter went to school by school bus. I shall not name her—I believe that names should not be used in this case. If the press are covering our proceedings, I hope that they will take special note of that. Brian Middleton's daughter was the last girl left on the bus. She was sexually assaulted by the driver. For the next five months, she had to use the same bus and be driven to school and back by the same driver. That, apart from the incident, was traumatic. For some time, she did not reveal, even to her parents, that she had been sexually assaulted because she was frightened, ashamed and traumatised. In many similar cases, even parents do not bring matters to light because they wish
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
to protect their children from further harm. However, the bus driver was found guilty of an offence and given a prison sentence.<br><br>
The regulations now become relevant to the case. After serving his sentence, that bus driver could obtain a public service vehicle licence and set up with another operator anywhere in the United Kingdom. The likelihood of the offence coming to light is so minimal as to be almost non-existent, as figures show. As a result of the looseness of the current regulations for public service vehicles operator's licences, that individual may be driving other young boys and girls to and from school, changing the route so that the child he has his eye on is the last one left on the bus. That is just one case, brought to our attention this morning by Mr. Brian Middleton, and it is one of many. The orders are not merely dry, technical matters, we prayed against them to give the Minister an opportunity to speak about some of the cases referred to under the PSV regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wants to explore that issue, will he say when he is referring to public service vehicles licence holders—that is, persons authorised to drive PSVs and when he is referring to operators' licence regulations, the matter for deliberation today? Although the hon. Gentleman raises a valid matter, we are discussing the operators' licence regulations, not the conduct regime for PSV licence holders, which although important, is for another occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that there is always a reserve, Mr. Hill, should you fall ill while in the Chair, which, of course, we hope will not happen. There is always someone willing to point out what is, or is not, in order. It is a shame that the opportunity has not been taken to discuss the issues, rather than trying for a technical knockout. I am aware of the difference between an operator's licence and a driver's licence. The Minister will accept that the drivers, to follow their occupation, must work for operators, some of which are covered by the regulations on fees and licences.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister wants to make a serious point, I shall be delighted to give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect to the hon. Gentleman, I am making the first serious point in the debate. The purpose of our business today is to consider the operator's licences regulations. If the hon. Gentleman wants to pursue his current line of thought, I should be grateful if he would say how it is related to the regulations, which follow from the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. I have heard nothing yet that brings the debate within the scope of these regulations. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman makes a serious point, and there may be an opportunity for him to raise the issue elsewhere, but I have not yet heard anything that relates to the business in hand; nor am I clear what point the hon. Gentleman is making in that context.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0203">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always gratifying to hear the thoughts of an experienced parliamentarian on how to make one's speech. While I remain in order in your eyes. Mr. Hill, I shall be happy to make my own speech in my own way. The organisations that I mentioned earlier—the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, the Advise Centre for Education, BUSK, Kidscape, Childline—and individual parents who care about the children's future, will have noted how keen the Minister is to intervene on technical matters and how eager he is to avoid genuine debate about how to stop bus drivers with PSV licenses reoffending and sexually abusing kids.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span> <span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give way to the Minster until I have spoken about sections 4 and 5, when the Minister might feel able to respond to the heart of the debate, rather than avoiding the discussion on how the children can be helped.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is almost the same point—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make progress. I have been very generous in giving way on things which have nothing to do with the debate. If the Minster has something to say on the debate I shall give way to him.<br><br>
I wish to refer specifically to regulations 4 and 5 which set out arrangements for checking applications and the prescribed period for making representations. I shall also refer to regulation 21 and the schedule which recognise that people must be of good repute and competence before they are issued with an operator's licence. It is these very procedures for checking people's suitability for holding a licence with which I take issue.<br><br>
The current system for checking the credentials of school minibus drivers is also inadequate. The application form for a PSV licence from the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency is self-certifying for drivers. There are currently no cross-checking procedures with the police to ensure that a person does not have a criminal record or a drink-drive charge prior to a licence being issued.<br><br>
Similarly, the traffic commissioners rely on an old fashioned system of publishing applicants' names for operators' licences every two weeks in a booklet and sending this out to statutory objectors such as the police. My hon. Friends the Members for Feltham and Heston (Mr. Keen) and for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) both take a great interest in this matter. The Curtis report comments that
<br><blockquote><p>"no figures of objection to PSV applications are published, but each Traffic Area tells me that it receives no more than one a year."</p></blockquote>
Either that bears good witness to the reputation of applicants or the checking procedure is simply not rigorous enough. It would be far better if the system were computerised so that one could be certain that applicants' names were definitely checked against the central police computer. Unfortunately, at the moment traffic commissioners rely on local knowledge, which is often a cursory glance through the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
local newspapers, to alert them to the potential problem applicants. Given the current feeble state of crosschecks the proposal in regulation 6 that
<br><blockquote><p>"a traffic commissioner shall not refuse an application for a licence, or grant it other than as requested without giving to the applicant an opportunity to state his case at an inquiry"</p></blockquote>
is laughable given that there are hardly any objections.<br><br>
I know that the Minister has figures on the very low level of objections. I hope that he will also concede that the low level simply illustrates the need for greater scrutiny in the system. I believe that the Minister has accepted these arguments and if he will engage in a debate no doubt we will come to some productive conclusions. The Minister said in a written answer that the Government's longer-term aim is the development of a common data base for operators and drivers for enforcement and licence purposes—clearly the Minister appreciates the difference between operators and drivers, even if others do not—which will provide links to enable traffic commissioners to receive information from other sources relevant to their licensing and discipline decisions. The Minister admits on the one hand that the system is stuck in the age of the quill pen, but on the other—at the moment, but hope springs eternal—he does nothing about it.<br><br>
The Minister may say that there is no evidence that unsafe operators are falling through the net. He would be wrong. Parliamentary questions on how the Department is progressing on these matters sometimes take some while to bear fruit so I did some quick research myself. I discovered that in one area a company obtained a licence to operate three coaches and minibuses despite having convictions for operating illegally, driving without insurance and speeding on three seperate occasions. Because the operator did not declare these facts on his form he was able to operate until 1992 when maintenance problems came to light.<br><br>
There is also a problem with the Home Office guidance on this responsibility. Apparently school bus drivers are not listed as one of the groups which
<br><blockquote><p>"should normally be subject to checks"</p></blockquote>
by the police. I hope that in this instance the Minister will take the fairly simple administrative steps required to ensure that this situation is reviewed.<br><br>
The Confederation of Road Passenger Transport has also contacted us about the regulations and has called for higher entry standards to the profession to improve the quality of bus services. It suggests that traffic commissioners should put new applicants under more stringent scrutiny.<br><br>
I should make a strong point about operators, and the CPRA, which speaks for them. The vast majority of operators are reliable and have nothing to fear from what we propose today. Indeed, it is in the interests of most operators to ensure that the odd cowboy is drummed out of business as rapidly as possible. The very few villains are the enemies of the good operators.<br><br>
Regulations 8 and 9 do not address a failing in the system—the absence of a communications system that links enforcement agencies, licensing authorities and the courts. For that reason, licensing authorities may not be aware that a licence holder has been charged
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0204">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
with an offence. Apparently people such as the traffic commissioners continue to rely on the local press and some liaison with the police and individuals to make them aware of criminal proceedings. Again, the Department of Transport ignores the potential of the information age.<br><br>
Last year, the Minister said, during debates on the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 that the current system was unsatisfactory because the first person to ensure that the traffic commissioner knew about the relevant conviction would be the immediate competitor of the convicted person. So, on these extremely serious matters, we must relay on the company down the road to keep tabs on its competitors and shop them. I do not think that it is necessarily right in the modern age to rely on the competitor down the road. The information technology at our disposal might be a more systematic way to find people than relying on someone down the road having a grudge against a company.<br><br>
Although the regulations are dry, they have a human dimension. I have mentioned already a most awful case. The Minister may say that the regulations would not have helped there as they are about drivers, not operators. But operators have some responsibility for their drivers. They may not be bound not to employ individuals, but they can bring matters to the attention of the relevant authorities.<br><br>
Regulations 8 and 9 prescribe that the traffic commissioner should, before suspending or revoking a licence, give notice to the holder of his right to make written representations. Unfortunately, many bus drivers who are guilty of sexual assault never get to that stage because the unfortunate victim is too traumatised to come forward. Even when a driver is caught, he is sometimes allowed to carry on driving his victim to school. We adhere absolutely to the principle that someone is innocent until proved guilty, but a driver under investigation in the kind of case that I have described should surely be suspended or given other duties by a responsible operator until the case has gone to court.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point. Will the hon. Gentleman spell out just what he means? is he saying that he believes that a driver who is accused of an offence should have action taken against him by the authorities before his case has been tried in court. I should be grateful for a simple yes or no answer, since it seems that all his others are unsatisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A simple answer, for the Minister, is no. For everyone else, I shall explain in more detail. In the circumstances that I described earlier, the driver was alleged to have sexually assaulted a young girl. It is not sensible for either the operator or the purchaser of the service to imagine that that man should continue to drive that bus. It would make far more sense for the driver to be assigned other duties or another route. The case would then be resolved before the individuals concerned met face to face again. This is not something
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
about which we need to pass laws; it is down to the common sense of the education authority, the operator or the bus driver's colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman says in that regard is totally unexceptionable: no one would disagree with a word. However, amid all the bluster, the hon. Gentleman was trying to suggest that somehow authorities should take action at the point at which allegations are made. But when I ask him directly whether that is what he proposes, he says no, it is not what he proposes.<br><br>
I tend to agree with him that the difficulty is that, however serious an allegation against an individual, we have in this country the principle that a person is innocent until proved guilty. That occasionally presents both taxi and public service vehicle licensing authorities with a genuine dilemma. But I fear that what the hon. Gentleman has offered us does not help to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the Minister was not listening. If he reads <i>Hansard tomorrow,</i> he will see that I made no proposal that the authorities should have the legal power to suspend individuals who have had allegations made against them. The Minister is creating a straw man and he has to blow very hard to knock it down.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will respond seriously to some of the points that I have raised. Again, I shall refer to one case. The Minister says that what I have said is unexceptionable, and then takes exception to it. He must confront the reality of what a number of people have been through. He has some responsibility in this matter, if only to indicate best practice. It is exceptionable and it is wrong for a young girl to be put in such a position. Operators or purchasing authorities should use their common sense to ensure that people are not put in that position.<br><br>
The Confederation of Passenger Transport has highlighted the problems of weak penalties for operators without a licence. It argues that
<br><blockquote><p>"persistent convictions for illegal operation of a PSV should cause any subsequent application for an Operator Licence to be refused because of loss of good repute and not, as appears to be present policy, granted in order to bring the applicant 'within the fold'. Increased penalties for illegal operation should include confiscation of the vehicle in question."</p></blockquote>
I understand that a few weeks ago, Gwent police ordered a crackdown on school bus operators, not least because of intensive lobbying from Pat Harris of BUSK. The police discovered that one third of the vehicles they checked were in a dangerous condition. That confirms the need for tougher enforcement.<br><br>
I thank the Minister again for his time this afternoon; these are important regulations. I hope that he will take the opportunity to take stock of the very real concerns that members of the public have expressed, rather than ignoring them or blustering about their irrelevance. The answer lies with the Minister. He can take steps that will mean that a significant number—however small—of individuals will not face the problems that I have described.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0205">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
All PSV applicants should be checked against a central criminal database by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the traffic commissioners. An effective communications system linking enforcement agencies, licensing authorities and the police should be established without any further delay.<br><br>
As the Minister knows from my previous discussions with him, I do not propose these ideas in any partisan sense.<br><br>
I hope that he will listen to what has been said and consider carefully what steps he can take to solve some of the problems.<br><br>
The Curtis report calls for a common database for the network and the Vehicle Inspectorate, as well as a national integrated management of the information on HGVs and PSVs. I hope that the Minister takes the opportunity that we have given him, that he listens to pressure groups, individual parents and others outside the House, and that he takes those two simple steps towards assisting some of those young children and their parents.</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Snape <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Bromwich, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be extremely brief. I listened carefully to what my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) said from the Front Bench. I appreciate the importance of his remarks. Before I raise another matter with the Minister, I must declare an interest as a non-executive director of West Midlands Travel, the principal bus operator across the west midlands and a subsidiary of the National Express Group.<br><br>
I am worried about the continuous licensing provisions of the regulations. Before attending the Committee, I took the precaution of reading the proceedings of the Third Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation of Wednesday 24 January, which dealt with similar regulations relating to heavy goods vehicles. Although, I do not want to reiterate the points made by the Opposition, because I was not a member of that Committee, I should like to know how continuous licensing will affect the passenger coach business.<br><br>
No one on either side of the Committee is in favour of cowboy operators. That point is repeatedly made. I appreciate the Minister saying in last week's deliberations that the purpose of such regulations is not to encourage cowboy operators. I am sure that that is as true of the coach and bus business as it is of the heavy goods vehicle business. Will the Minister tell the Committee what the traffic commissioners thought about these proposals?<br><br>
The phrase used to justify the renewal of operators' licences under the previous regulations was that the operator must be of good repute, financial standing and professional competence. I am worried how such attributes will be checked under continuous licensing. I was going to use the phrase "licensing in perpetuity", but the Minister made a point of saying last week that that was not the case. However, I notice that the Department's justification for the regulation dealing with an increase in fees is that the licence is being issued in perpetuity. I am sure that that is not a deliberate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
contradiction, but it is certainly an inadvertent contradiction. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain that.<br><br>
I do not want the Committee to believe that because the company with which I am connected is a major operator we wish to prevent new operators from entering the bus and coach business. I know from discussions with the Minister that he is as concerned to improve the qaulity of bus and coach services in the United Kingdom as those of us connected with the industry and others who take an interest in these matters. However, will he assure me that the increase in quality standards in the bus and coach industry can still be a major Government objective, notwithstanding the provisions of these regulations? Smaller operators do not always have the financial and physical resources to maintain their vehicles to the same standard as larger, more reputable operators. I know that at least one traffic commissioner was worried about enforcement. I also know that there were mixed feelings about the five-year renewal period.<br><br>
Most traffic commissioners know which operators in their area to call before them. If licences are to be issued "in perpetuity", the Committee and the traffic commissioners would welcome an assurance from the Minister that it will be possible to enforce the regulations on the small minority of cowboy operators-some of whom appear to come in and out of the industry under different names with monotonous regularity—as effectively as in the past.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will accept that I have raised some genuine misgivings—I put it no more strongly than that—about the proposals. None of us wants to burden bus and coach operators with unnecessary regulations. I hope that the Minister will be able to relay his assurances through <i>Hansard</i> to those of us with connections to the industry.</span></p>
<p>5.7 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Transport in London (Mr. Steven Norris)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East has reminded some of us of the excellent contribution that he used to make on transport matters from the Opposition Front Bench. I fear that some of my hon. Friends may miss him greatly. I appreciate that praising with faint damns has ruined many a parliamentary reputation, so I shall not eulogise further, except to say that at last we have heard a speech addressing the subject under consideration and posing the pertinent questions that the Government are obliged to answer in relation to the regulations.<br><br>
The regulations follow on from the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994, which introduced the regime of continuous licensing. The regulations give that regime form and present the basis for the application for and granting of licences.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East made the important point that no good deregulation proposal should result in a lesser emphasis being placed on quality or in a lowering of standards. The hon. Gentleman was kind enough and assiduous enough to read the report of the proceedings on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0206">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
1994 Act, so he will know that I have frequently said that good deregulation must pass the tests of not reducing standards of safety or of consumer protection before it can pass the test of removing an undue burden on a business or an individual. Neither West Midlands Travel nor any hon. Member would contemplate a regulation that removed a burden from a commercail enterprise at the expense of public safety. I share the belief of the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East that public safety should be paramount. Our proposals on continuous licensing were underpinned by our determination that they could be introduced only if we were satisfied that the checks made on operators would remain effective, removing only the needless bureaucracy that the previous system introduced.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East knows from experience that one of the features of the old system in relation to heavy goods vehicles was the need for periodic advertisement, despite the fact that in about 98 per cent. of cases there had not been the slightest interest in, or objection to, the operating centre throughout the preceding five years. Therefore, we insist that traffic commissioners must continue to look at every licence on a quinquennial basis and take whatever action is appropriate, but without the superfluous burden of placing advertisements, which may swell the coffers of the free press but do so at the expense of the transport industry.<br><br>
Public service vehicles are slightly different because, as the hon. Gentleman will know, public service I vehicle operating centres are not subject to the regulations, which relate to the operator of the business. As the hon. Gentleman said, the three areas in which the traffic commissioners take particular interest are repute, financial standing and technical competence. I give the hon. Gentleman a specific reassurance that nothing in the regulations in any way reduces the obligation—never mind the opportunity—that the traffic commissioners have to ensure that every operator's licence is reviewed, as previously, on a quinquennial basis.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made an extremely relevant point—probably because he knows something about the business—when he said that traffic commissioners tend to know their operators. That is right; that is the rationale behind the existing system, according to which many traffic commissioners are spread around the country rather than a single traffic commissioner sitting in Whitehall. Traffic commissioners, or their deputies, know who operates in their area. That is crucial to the judgment that they make about the suitability of people to hold or retain licences.<br><br>
I should like to make one further point on that subject before the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East intervenes. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North referred to cases in which it might have been right for a traffic commissioner to take more draconian action than he did in relation to a particular licence. But that is the power and discretion exercised by traffic commissioners. As the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East knows well, the regulations give traffic
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
commissioners those powers and nothing in this legislation detracts from that. I warn the hon. Member for Nottingham, North against making judgments about individual cases without having heard all the evidence that the traffic commissioners will have heard. Traffic commissioners have those powers, and it is up to them to exercise their powers as they think fit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hestitate to introduce even a remotely partisan note after the embarrassing praise that was heaped upon me by the Minister. But if traffic commissioners are so wonderful, as many of us agree that they are, I hope that I shall not be ruled out of order if I ask the Minister why he is anxious to reduce their number and power.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The disposal of traffic commissioners throughout the United Kingdom must remain a matter that relates not only to the advantage of traffic commissioners being local but to ensuring that public money is spent sensibly. For example, National Express, the parent company of the company of which the hon. Gentleman is a director, operates in every traffic area in the country. Those areas vary greatly in size and in the number of operators with whom traffic commissioners deal. I shall continue to strive for optimum efficiency in the number and disposition of traffic commissioners, while in no sense wishing to diminish their powers.<br><br>
I want to correct the hon. Gentleman on that latter point. He may fairly make observations about the number and disposition of traffic commissioners, but I am sure that he will want to reflect on his observation that their powers are to be reduced. I am not in the business of reducing their powers; on the contrary, I believe that they fulfil an extremely important role.<br><br>
I thank the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East for bringing us to the essence of the regulations. I have one more observation to make on the subject of standards. The hon. Gentleman rightly said that it is not only the large operators who want standards to improve. My discussions with the bus working group, which is made up of representatives of the industry and local authority associations and my officials, have taught me that both large and small operators want higher standards. They believe that that is how the whole industry will attract more people. They share my belief that the bus is the cornerstone of any public transport strategy, and that standards must be improved.<br><br>
I shall continue to work constructively, with operators—as I have done during the past 18 months—to ensure that we put flesh on those bones and produce a package, following our original announcement earlier this month, that will raise standards nationally.<br><br>
Finally, I turn to the points raised by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North. He spoke in general terms, and in the "something must be done" spirit that so often characterises speeches by Opposition Members when they are not calling for their weekly public inquiry. However, the argument he advanced is an extremely serious one.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0207">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
I want to put on the record the absolute seriousness with which I take the safety of young people in particular, and of other vulnerable passengers in general, when they travel on buses. There is no disagreement between the hon. Gentleman and myself on that issue, and it would be beneath him to suggest otherwise. The hon. Gentleman suggested various measures, which he believes can improve the situation. I do not want to try the patience of my right hon. Friends, but I should like to say a few words about those suggestions.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman acknowledged the extremely difficult predicament faced by licensing authorities when a person is accused, but not convicted, of an offence—for example, one involving a minor. The hon. Gentleman said that, although it might be sensible for the company or local authority concerned to assign that individual to other duties where the same degree of risk was not attendant, he agreed that we face an obstacle that is fundamental to the process of natural justice.<br><br>
That problem has caused me huge, personal disquiet. These are not the first cases that have confronted me with the proposition that a person should be allowed to continue with a licence when they have been accused, but not convicted, of a serious offence. Such cases have arisen in the taxi and private hire industry on a number of occasions, and I have shared the agonies endured by those who have the power either to withhold licences, or to allow licensees to operate. However, the courts have confirmed the view that I have, reluctantly, come to hold, which is that we have no option—I do not want to advance this as a blanket proposition, but, in the end, it is regrettably unarguable—but to allow people the benefit of the doubt. They must be considered innocent until proved guilty.<br><br>
On the question of how to improve the licensing arrangements for HGV or PSV licence holders. I have to say that, although such licences are not, strictly speaking, the subject of the regulations before the Committee, traffic commissioners are responsible for granting PSV operators licences and for enforcing the "good repute" requirement. That requirement relates not only to operators, but to PSV licence holders.<br><br>
It is an offence for any driver to fail to declare relevant convictions when applying for a PSV licence. The police are statutory objectors and have the right to object to any licence if they have any reason to believe that the person concerned has illegally withheld information or not presented wholly accurate information.<br><br>
I emphasise that any applicant for an operator's licence must declare any relevant convictions that he or any of his employees—I stress employees—have had in the past five years. The names of all applicants are published fortnightly in notices and proceedings in advance of the grant of a licence. That allows police to take up their statutory rights to object. In considering good repute, the traffic commissioners will want to take account of any circumstances in which an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
operator might have employed an individual driver who was subsequently found to have breached the conditions under which his licence was granted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will join me in asking operators to pay special attention to children with special needs, particularly disabled children and children who are deaf and dumb. Such children are particularly prone to be targeted by paedophiles who have inveigled themselves into jobs as school bus drivers. I thank the Minister for letting me raise that point of particular concern to pressure groups including the Advice Centre for Education and the Suzy Lamplugh Trust.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge the importance of those groups. However, in addressing how to eliminate the risk, such as it is, we deal not with the category of persons who may be carried but with the suitability of drivers. Clearly, we license the driver not simply to drive particular types of individual on his or her coach. The driver is licensed as a PSV driver.<br><br>
The first of the two central points made by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North was that we should continue our serious efforts to improve the flow of information to traffic commissioners from courts and the Vehicle Inspectorate. I will not reiterate the debate that took place in this Room a week ago, but the hon. Gentleman must not underestimate the serious technical difficulties implied by that undertaking. A vast array of offences is involved. Simply, a person may be convicted of a serious sexual offence while he was working as a bank clerk and make a subsequent false declaration to obtain a PSV licence. No system related to information from courts will be able to pick that up retrospectively. It will be identified only when that person comes to the attention of the authorities. It would be entirely regrettable if he did so only when a further offence had been committed.<br><br>
I agree that the hon. Gentleman's second point is important. He asked whether it would be practical to extend to the PSV licensing process the process of automatic checking with the police national computer. It is technically possible, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman shares my concern not to underestimate the technical and logistical difficulties that that would involve. The Association of Chief Police Officers will certainly advise him of those difficulties. However, I assure him that I am keen to explore all available avenues to ensure that people with inappropriate criminal convictions are not put in positions in which others are at risk. I pray in aid of that commitment my own record over the years on PHV licensing in the City of London. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I have made the point, in concert with the Suzy Lamplugh Trust and others, over many years, that such checks are not currently available. It is regrettable that trade unions, including the Transport and General Workers Union, have not seen the value of that proposal and have hindered attempts to bring it into being by use of a Private Member's Bill or another method.<br><br>
I accept that the hon. Gentleman's desire to eliminate risk is sincere. I, too, take that issue seriously and shall do what I can to ensure that any mechanism

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
that can improve the traffic commissioners' ability to take effective measures to check the quality of individual applicants, and their criminal convictions, will be introduced.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Allen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. I should declare that my constituency is sponsored by the TGWU, which has not been in touch with me on that matter. I thought I should put that on record in these post-Nolan days.</span></p>
