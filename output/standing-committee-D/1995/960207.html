	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Merchant Shipping (Port State Control) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995, No. 3128).</p></blockquote>
This important statutory instrument is part of a series that is full of fine sentiment that is not backed by adequate Government action. The background to the measure is that 11,000 foreign-registered ships come to our shore and ports each year. About 30 per cent. of those ships are inspected, and 70 per cent. of them are found to have defects. Many then receive exemption certificates and are allowed to sail away unrepaired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should congratulate the European Union for pushing this issue and for getting the Government to act by presenting the regulations. Opposition Members welcome implementation of part 1 of the directive on port state control regulations and the additional measures in parts 2 and 3 of the directive to improve inspections, give rights of appeal and provide compensation when ships are detained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree that improving shipping standards is vital and that safety is a priority. We should also be proud of the United Kingdom's record on port state control, and we should record our thanks to the marine safety inspectors for their excellent record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfortunate that the Government's current policy of cost cutting, allied to deregulation, puts those important objectives in jeopardy. That policy risks the safety of passengers and the health of our environment. Those principles are also important to the shipping industry, which is right to feel let down by a Government whose policy has led to a staggering decline in the British fleet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble Friend Lord Stanley Clinton-Davis often quotes the fact that, when he left office in 1979, a fleet of 1,278 vessels of more than 500 gross registered tonnes was under the United Kingdom flag. Now, only 270 vessels remain. That is the extent of the decline in the United Kingdom merchant fleet in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have stressed before that it is not the number of regulations that the Government enact that makes a difference to shipping standards, but the effective implementation of them. The regulation of ship safety, marine pollution and ship-board living and working conditions depend on high quality and rigorous safety inspections of ships by full-time public servants who are independent of commercial pressures. By imposing cuts on the Department of Tranport agencies
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
that are responsible for maritime safety, the Government are reducing both the ability to clamp down on unsafe or polluting foreign ships coming to or going from the United Kingdom, and the ability to ensure that our ships are up to scratch. I am worried that our previously good record is at risk and I urge the Minister to review shipping policy to ensure that there is no room for declining standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the United Kingdom, port state control is hindered by inadequate resource allocation to the Marine Safety Agency which can currently afford to inspect only about 30 per cent. of ships. Regulation 5(1) of the statutory instrument sets a minimum inspection level of only 25 per cent. That, potentially, could allow the MSA inspection rate to drop even below its current level. I understand that the MSA has assured the National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers that the number of port state control inspections will not be reduced by the introduction of the statutory instrument. I hope that the Minister will reaffirm the commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not enough merely to say that there will be the same percentage of inspections—they must be as rigorous as current inspections. The Minister may be able to say that he foresees an increase in the number of inspections, because we should never be complacent and should always seek to extend port state control wherever possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The poor safety standards of some flag of convenience ships, and foreign-flagged vesels with even worse records, are underlined regularly by the MSA in is detention lists. There are often major deficiencies such as non-operational firefighting equipment and defective life boats. We must ensure that the essential statistics on such deficiencies continue to be published regularly and that sufficient resources are allocated to solve the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, regulation 16(1) requres less frequent and less comprehensive detention lists than those currently published. I seek a public assurance from the Minister that the United Kingdom will continue good practice and, indeed, that there will be better practice than is required by the bare bones of the statutory instrument. He also has the chance, should he wish to take it, of commenting on the adequacy of the penalties for offences. That matter is a cause of deep concern in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
International conventions are ineffective without independent full-time staff to conduct inspections and enforce regulations. Regulations 14 and 4 require professional expertise and will depend on sufficient numbers of professional staff for their full implementation. In the light of cuts in the MSA, I am concerned about the United Kingdom's ability to meet the requirements of the directive and to maintain and improve the United Kingdom's superior practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have three concerns about the staffing for inspections of marine safety and anti-pollution enforcement in respect of the statutory instrument. First, I am concerned about the numbers in the Marine
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Safety Agency and the Coastguard agency, which have been cut. Mr. Robin Bradley, the head of the MSA, supplied an answer to my recent parliamentary question about surveyors in the MSA. He revealed that 22 surveyors left in 1995 and only nine were replaced with new recruits. There is attrition at a time when we should be seeking to hold the numbers or, where resources allow, increase them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, the coastguard service, which so often provides safety and environmental back-up on marine matters, is now under review. I understand that 10 to 15 station officers around the country are to go and that 380 auxiliary coastguards are to go, and be replaced by less well-trained and less skilled watch assistants. That is the wrong direction in which to go if we are honest about the commitments in the fine words before us about improving safety, inspection and control of our environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second concern about the statutory instrument relates to levels of training and skills. An alarming example of the lack of training was reported to me recently, concerning Coastguard agency staff who man radio distress monitors. Under an international obligation, they should be trained to operate such distress monitors but, in some cases, they have not received that training. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain that now or at some time in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How are we to uphold the new regulations that we are debating if agency staff are not properly trained? A related and more pervasive example has also been reported to me on several occasions. It is that ship inspectors benefit from seafaring experience. The view of the Chamber of Shipping and the officers' and seafarers' unions is that by running down our fleet, the Government are reducing the number and standard of available inspectors. By the continuation of flagging out and eroding of the fleet, we are bringing about consequences for further down the line. The United Kingdom has always been highly regarded for its seafaring standards, but its record is diminishing because of the need for ship owners to flag out ships, not least because of the lack of support for the industry from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That creates a continuing loss of skills. I am apprehensive about the fact that staffing cuts, inadequate training and ever-decreasing numbers of engineers and surveyors with necessary seafaring experience will be to the detriment of safety at sea. In the longer term, that will also affect our ability to staff the shipping and insurance business and even the International Maritime Organisation, which relies on Government-trained surveyors to represent the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Government are undertaking a study—perhaps it has been completed—on the levels, and lack of, surveyors. The view of the officers' union NUMAST is that we require 1,200 new trainees each year to feed the maritime industry in all its diversity and, above all, the MSA. I sprung that on the Minister, so if he cannot reply immediately, perhaps he will write and tell me if it is possible to publish the survey urgently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
My third and final point is the United Kingdom's ability to meet our treaty obligations in these regulations, which result from the delegation of essential surveys and inspections to the private sector. Some ship surveyors on short contracts with the MSA are employed, before and after, by shipping companies, which could lead to a conflict of interest. The independence of our marine safety inspection services must be maintained, not sacrificed to cost-cutting. Classification societies do a good job, but they can never be as independent as the MSA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We used parliamentary procedure to object to this order so as to raise vital marine issues. The objectives of high safety standards, reduced pollution at sea, better shipboard conditions and regional co-operation to achieve those aims, suffer from a marked lack of parliamentary time to discuss them. Shipping has become a Cinderella in the transport industry, and I hope that by discussing the matter with the Minister present, we have done something to put that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The klondiker Aktinial has been detained since October 1994 and, although the Government promised to produce a White Paper on the safety and health risks associated with such vessels more than a year ago, they have not done so. The lack of parliamentary consideration of such matters means that the Department becomes slacker than it might otherwise be. Will the Minister say when the White Paper will be published?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to finding sufficient time to oversee the effective implementation of regional shipping regulations, we should try to encourage the extension of port state control so that there is a truly global network. That will be one of the incoming Labour Government's priorities, and I urge this Government, in their international talks, to encourage Governments of non-European Union signatories to the Paris memorandum of understanding on port state control to meet the conditions of the European Union directive on port control implemented by the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must emphasise the fact that flag state control, as opposed to port state control, is extremely important, too. In discussions with my noble Friend Lord Clinton-Davis, I discovered that in 1978 he proposed an international flag state exchange so that various surveyors from different countries could be trained, and those from less-developed countries could have the benefit of the experience of western European and north American surveyors. That would be the embryo of a global system of marine safety inspectors, so that the flag state could carry out much of the work that is loaded on to the port state. That may bear further examination by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our strategy for shipping for the year 2000 focuses on improving shipping standards in the United Kingdom and, through international collaboration and agreement, improving shipping standards worldwide. Our policy aims to promote maritime safety, to combat marine pollution, to protect the environment, to improve working conditions and to prevent accidents at sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are a valuable step forward, but they must be accompanied by adequate enforcement.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
I hope that, because the issue has been raised in Committee, the industry will see that the House takes the issue seriously. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to our points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.49 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to add a few words to what the hon. Member for Nottingham, North said, much of which I agree with. I agree especially with his point about the importance of having sufficient people coming through with experience in the merchant marines to take onshore posts such as surveyors and inspectors. There is growing concern that, before long, there will be a shortage of people with sufficient experience to carry out onshore jobs. I know from past correspondence with the Department that some steps have been taken to address the issue, and if the Minister can update us on the position, that would be welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Donaldson says in chapter 6 of his report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In an ideal world Flag States, whose flags are worn by the world's shipping, would lay down, and enforce upon their own shipowners, standards of design, maintenance and operation which would ensure a very high standard of safety at sea."</p></blockquote>
Lord Donaldson goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regrettably it is beyond argument that not all Flag States live up to their responsibilities."</p></blockquote>
That is why we have before us regulations on port state control, which still has a role to play, even in an ideal world. However, it assumes even greater importance in dealing with ships that are all too frequently below standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that the regulations have a European Union dimension with regard to tackling the problems of shipping safety. The European Union member states have co-operated constructively in addressing these issues. If we are to tackle shipping safety, the more countries that are involved the better. As for ensuring fairness of competition, it would be to the detriment of British ports if we operated a tight regime while the regime across the channel—in Rotterdam, for example—was lax. Therefore, the European approach is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two specific points for the Minister. One, raised by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, concerns the promised consultation document on klondikers. It. Raises the questions of the link to safety and of insurance for shipping in general, not just the klondikers, although they were instrumental in bringing the issue to the fore. It would be interesting to know how much the Government are still laying out for the sums not yet recovered from the incidents in Lerwirk harbour when klondikers ran aground. Some steps have been taken with regard to klondikers, but the important issue of linking insurance and safety standards to licences has yet to be adequately addressed. I would welcome an indication of when the consultation document might be forthcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is technical, but important. Paragraph 9(2)(b) of the regulations states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"A detention notice may:
	<ol>
	<li>include a direction that a ship shall remain in a particular place, or shall move to a particular anchorage or berth; and</li>
	<li>specify circumstances when the master of the ship may move his ship from a specified place for reasons of safety or prevention of pollution."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
I know that it has been flagged up with me that there must be some flexibility. In some areas, the weather can rise up suddenly when action has to be taken. Would a harbour master in Lerwick, for example, have to contact a Marine Safety Agency official or surveyor in Aberdeen, or even further afield, in the small hours to see what could be done about moving a ship which was being detained? Flexibility is important, although the sanction element of detention must be maintained. If the Minister cannot give me an answer today on how, in the interests of safety, flexibility will be observed, perhaps he will write to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the whole, the regulations are welcome. A number of steps have been taken to improve shipping safety, not least since the Braer went aground in my constituency and Lord Donaldson's subsequent report. For example, the monthly announcements of ships that have been detained are welcome. It would be interesting to know whether any pattern has emerged to show that people are waking up to what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory instrument is another important step forward. But as the hon. Member for Nottingham, North said, making laws is one thing—enforcing them is another. We hope that the enforcement and the resources that it requires will match the step forward taken in putting the regulations before Parliament today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.54 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Snape 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Bromwich, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be extremely brief. I must declare an interest as a member of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers. Those hon. Members who have had the doubtful privilege of listening to me over the years will know that my maritime experience is fleeting to say the least. [Hon. Members: "Oh"] No pun intended, Sir John. Since the amalgamation of the National Union of Railwaymen and the National Union of Seamen I am proud to be a member of a union that embraces both those great industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North for outlining the graphic decline in the number of vessels sailing under the British flag. The Tory party habitually wraps itself in the Union flag when it suits, but the decline of the British merchant fleet is nothing for the Conservatives to be proud of. I hope that under the provisions of the regulations the Minister will be able to give us some assurances that that appalling decline from 1,278 down to 270 will be arrested and that the Department of Transport will do what it can to enforce some of the practices that make flagging out so attractive to less scrupulous shipowners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) referred to Lord Donaldson's comments.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Again, it would help the Committee if the Minister could tell us what action the Government plan to take to give some impression of urgancy and concern about the appalling standards of some of these nations who have enormous merchant fleets simply, because any regulations that they have are obviously not enforced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two regulations on which I should like to ask the Minister a couple of questions. The first is on the "Publication of Detentions". It would help all of us who take an interest in these matters to know which flag states transgress regulations. I hope that the Minister will see that the Department of Transport publishes those figures. I realise that they are supposed to be published quarterly, but perhaps they can be brought to the attention of the House and certainly to the attention of those Committees of the House that take a regular interest in these matters. We could then see whether those offenders, who are well known to all of us, show any sign of improvement in the years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland mentioned, the possibility of European Community co-operation to tackle these flag states should not be underestimated. If we could get some concerted action it might help the future survival—which is what we are really talking about—of the British merchant marines. It is not many years since hon. Members on both sides were praising the contribution that British seafarers made to the Falklands campaign. Presumably if the Argentinians reinvade we shall ask Liberia, Cyprus and Paraguay to assist our military efforts. Certainly the pathetically small number of ships flying the British flag would have great difficulty in providing such assistance in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question is on regulation 18, which relates to offences. I hope that the Minister will publish regularly a list of the most common offences caught by the regulations and, just as important, the penalties that are administered against those so caught. I am struck by regulation 18(5) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be a defence for a person charged under this regulation to prove that the person charged took all reasonable steps to avoid committing the offence."</p></blockquote>
I am not sure how common such wording is, but it seems to provide a wonderful defence for anyone charged under the regulation. Was it perhaps put in there to undermine what appeared on the face of it to be a long overdue attempt at enforcement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, and picking up a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North, I should like to mention a strategy for shipping. I do not want to introduce any note of controversy into the debate, but a strategy for shipping has been conspicuously lacking under the present Government. That has resulted in a precipitous decline of the British merchant fleet in the past decade and a half. It is to be hoped that a fresh Government with a new strategy—or, rather, with a strategy at all—will enable that decline to be reserved. I hope that that will be sooner rather than later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, shall be brief. I expect that all members of the Committee agree with Lord Donaldson's view of the need to tighten up port state control and with his statement, at paragraph 11.73 of the inquiry report, of the intention
	<br><blockquote><p>"that our recommendations should force bad operators out of business or force them to improve."</p></blockquote>
I am worried that bad operators will still be allowed to slip through the net.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 15 includes a reference to the duties of pilots of vessels entering ports and mooring. The provision states that they shall report any deficiencies that they find in the vessel. What is surprising is that no duty is placed on operators—not of the vessel, but of the berth where the vessel is discharging or loading. A vessel might be at such a berth for many days. It would certainly be there many hours. Yet the order includes no requirement for operators to report deficiencies that they discover while the ship is in use there. That is a clear omission, given that operators of shoreside facilities have a vested interest in ensuring that their operations are as quick and efficient as possible, and in seeing the back of a bad vessel—one with significant deficiencies. I am surprised that the regulations do not deal with that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue comes to mind in relation to the possibility of vessels being allowed to slip through the control net—bearing in mind the problems highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North regarding the number of inspectors. There is a need for a system that would show up a vessel as possibly rogue. One of Lord Donaldson's recommendations, made at paragraph 11.49, was that
	<br><blockquote><p>"if more than one of several ships in the same ownership or management is found to be substandard on inspection in Paris MOU ports, a notice requirement should be imposed on all the ships in the same ownership or management."</p></blockquote>
That is a sensible, logical recommendation. There is a good chance that a manager of a fleet of vessels who is running one rogue ship is likely to be running many. I am surprised that such issues are not covered by the regulations. An easy way could be provided for MSA inspectors to identify and draw attention to vessels that are likely to cause pollution or other problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect that most hon. Members would agree with my final observations, which relate to the issues covered by part III of the regulations, entitled:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Inspection of Familiarity of Crew with Operational Procedures".</p></blockquote>
That is a vital subject. I do not know whether any hon. Members have read the report on the disaster of the Scandinavia Star, which was a ro-ro ferry operating between Denmark and Sweden. The incident involved horrendous loss of life. Not as many lives were lost as on the Estonia, but the victims were burnt to death, or overcome by fumes. The report showed that one of the main causes of loss of life on that scale was the fact that the crew was multi-lingual and did not know the basic safety procedures. I am concerned that the work load placed on the MSA inspectors will not leave
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
them time to check on those vital issues. When there is an emergency on a vessel, having to translate in up to seven languages, as was the case on the Scandinavian Star, makes matters worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spent more than 14 years working on vessels which travelled abroad from Milford Haven. It was normal for at least three languages to be spoken on board; in a typical vessel, the captain and chief engineer may have been Norwegian, the first officer may have been Indian and the crew may have been Philippine. There was frequently no common language and issues had to be explained at great length, often using sign language. In an emergency, that can lead to disaster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North has emphasised the need for sufficient staff to carry out the vital inspections—not just the physical inspections of the condition of the vessel, but checks on the ability of the crew to communicate with each other. That is an important issue which the Minister should address.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pendle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger) has anticipated many of the points that I had intended to raise, so I shall confine myself to one issue, which relates to what the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) said. I am not sure whether one can talk of level playing fields when discussing maritime matters, but I am concerned that all ports should operate the same level of inspection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations implement directive 95/21/EC, which will, presumably, apply to all member states of the European Union. Non-member states will be covered by the French or Paris memorandum of understanding, first negotiated in 1982. The Baltic states—Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania—do not feature on the list of signatories to the memorandum of understanding. The former East Germany is now part of the European Union and is therefore included. Does the Minister know whether the Baltic states will soon become signatories to the memorandum? If they do not sign up, it will be easy for rogue operators to berth their ships in Baltic ports, where they would not be subject to the same standard of inspection as elsewhere in the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.8 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eddie Loyden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Garston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise two issues. The first relates to the reference in the regulations to bulk carriers. We are all aware of the Government's shameful lack of response to the issues raised by the loss of vessels such as the Derbyshire and the Kowloon Bridge which have been lost at sea, the former going down with the full crew. Before and during the war, I went to sea in rust buckets in intolerable conditions. The Government must recognise that shipboard conditions for seamen should be vastly improved and that seamen have the right to a decent life on board ship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I welcome the regulations as a step forward. I hope that the Government will Co-operate fully in implementing them. The list of items for inspection on bulk carriers is welcome: it includes possible corrosion of deck or machinery foundations, possible deformation or corrosion of hatch covers, possible cracks or local corrosion of transverse bulkheads and access to cargo holds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any of those problems could have caused the sinking of the Derbyshire and of other bulk carriers. I do not think that naval architects—who are men of integrity in whom we used to have much faith—have been slack in designing such ships. The problem is that designs are based purely on the economics of the industry and not on the safety of those who sail in bulk carriers. The number of such vessels that have sunk over a comparatively short time suggests that something basic is wrong. That is also true of ro-ro ferries, whose turnaround time is the speediest that a vessel can manage, but that is achieved by sacrificing safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our maritime industry should work to its maximum efficiency, but that should not be achieved at the expense of the safety and well-being of the men and women who crew ships. That tradition goes back for centuries. The Government should resolve such problems. Other members of the Committee have said that some regulations are meaningless because of a lack of international agreement. Flagging out of ships and registration of vessels has made the control of standards aboard ships very difficult to achieve in this country and throughout the world. When a flag is flying on a vessel, access should be provided for inspection, and vessels should conform to the rules that apply internationally. I hope that the Government will take appropriate action. The maritime group in the House recognised that excellent rules exist internationally, but many nations avoid implementing them to reduce costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are a step forward and should be implemented. The Minister should take on board what was said this afternoon about ensuring the safety and well-being of those who crew ships.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.13 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mr. Steve Norris)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) made it clear that, as a former Minister for shipping, he sees no difficulty in implementing the regulations rapidly. Obviously, I respect my hon. Friend's wishes, so I shall not detain the Committee overlong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I must reject an extraordinary notion that is part of the union-oriented view of the Labour party. The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) argued that the decline in the British register is somehow caused by the absence of a shipping policy and that it was nothing to do with the fact that shipping unions continually raise the hurdles that owners have to jump over. However, owners are free to register anywhere in the world, and the higher the unions raise the hurdles, fewer owners will fly the red ensign.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way; I have hardly started my speech rebutting the hon. Gentleman's absurd assertions. He is an expert on railways, but he was generous enough to admit that there are some lacunae in his experience of the maritime industry. The hon. Gentleman's notion runs through every observation that he makes about shipping—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I interrupt the old sea dog?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spent most of my young life in the constituency of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Mr. Loyden). As a Liverpudlian, an indecent proportion of my life has been spent on the docks, which are much closer to the sea than West Bromwich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern is expressed by the hon. Member for Garston, for whom I have a great respect because he has spent much of his life at sea in dangerous conditions. He served on vessels during the war, much to his credit, and he has our gratitude. However, I must say to him as gently as I can that he is wrong if he believes that the way to preserve the British shipping register is to impose more and more obligations on British shipowners. If there are members of one industry in the world who are free to go wherever they want, it is those who ply their business in great waters, who can go wherever in the world they want to locate their vessels for registration purposes. It is worth making that fundamental point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I reject the unwarranted assertion made by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North that the 20 per cent. efficiency savings that the Government properly required of the Marine Safety Agency and the Coastguard Agency have resulted in a loss of safety. They have not, because the economies were directed at establishment costs and at improving efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second great absurdity of the Opposition is their assumption that there can be no saving in any arm of government without compromising safety. I hear that argument every week. In what is becoming a weekly ritual, the hon. Member for Nottingham, North hijacks regulations and turns them into a press release. The purpose of today's discussion is for the hon. Gentleman to get a soundbite if he can, but, fortunately, his choice of topic is so obscure that not much sound wishes to be bitten. None the less, he tries his best and he has proved himself to be a past master at making a silk purse out of a sow's ear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the Minister thinks of his next cliché, will he give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because the hon. Gentleman wants to allow his colleagues to return to their lawful duties as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chief executives of the Marine Safety Agency and the Coastguard Agency—that issue was also raised—have publicly made it clear that at no time has safety been compromised—nor will it be compromised. Members of all parties would expect no
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
less, but they would recognise that if those public servants did not believe that to be the case, they would not add their names to such a statement. They have said that in explicit terms in press releases. That is the answer to the absurd notion that the fact that the Conservative party and the Government believe in obtaining value for the money for the taxpayer and the delivery of efficient public services is not in the interests of those who employ those services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with some specific points and will try not to be over long in doing so. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North referred to 30 per cent. of vessels being inspected. He ignores the fact that the European requirement under the directive is only 25 per cent; that the level being achieved is 26 per cent; and that the level in the United Kingdom has been consistently higher because we are more conscientious and safety-orientated than many other nations. The hon. Gentleman said that 70 per cent. of vessels are defective but he knows that that covers a massive range of defects and, on a large ship, it is not surprising that a conscientious inspector—as all inspectors are—will find some small fault and notify the master that it needs to be corrected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman ought to have drawn attention to the detained list. I make this point to the hon. Gentleman to add to his knowledge on marine matters. By adding one fact, we will probably double his knowledge. He would know, had he read it, that the register is required under the directive to be published quarterly. The British Government have not only led the world in publishing a register before it was required: they do so monthly. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland knows rather more about such matters than most, so he will be aware that about 200 vessels are on the list in a year. That roughly reflects the number of vessels that should not be allowed to leave until certain problems have been attended to. The detailed list will include the flag state of the vessel. Therefore, it will be possible to determine which states are the worst offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Using my fundamental political premise that even a stopped clock is right twice a day, I concede that the hon. Member for Nottingham, North made one point that was perfectly true. He said that flag state control, which is control by the state where the vessel is registered, is the ideal, but that most nations of the world are unfortunately not as conscientious as members of the Paris memorandum of understanding on port state control group and the United Kingdom. The hon. Gentleman was right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice), the point about membership of the Paris memorandum of understanding group is that it is voluntary. Other states may choose to join, but they will do so when they can meet the standards that that group and the regulations require. To be blunt, the regulations tackle those nations that do not meet such standards. If we reach the stage at which we can rely on flag state control and accept the standards set in other flag states, that will be ideal. Sadly, that day is far from us. Although we would welcome an increase in the membership of the Paris memorandum of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
understanding group, we cannot anticipate that in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the level of fines is adequate. The hon. Member for Pendle should take into account the fact that the costs of delay, of rectification and of reinspection are a considerable burden on an operator. They act as a considerable deterrent. In raising the issue of the integrity of the inspectors of the Marine Safety Agency, the hon. Member for Pendle has done them no service of justice. Those who follow the work of the inspectorate of the Marine Safety Agency know that its inspectors are of the highest integrity. I pay great tribute to their objectivity. There is not the slightest evidence that their objectivity has ever been compromised. I compliment them on their high standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland asked me about the consultation paper on further means to deal with substandard ships, including klondikers. We hope to publish that paper shortly, but it is likely that it will include proposals for primary legislation. Therefore, it is important to work out the details before the paper is launched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland also asked whether emergency arrangements would be in place to ensure that a vessel detained offshore would be able to respond safely in an emergency. The hon. Member for Garston will appreciate that an example of that could be when a vessel is detained outside Lerwick harbour and a bad storm blows up. In such a case, the vessel's master must be able to take appropriate action to avoid the risk of the vessel running aground. Shetland Islands council has considered precisely that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the hon. Gentleman shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What's he got that I haven't?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Emergency arrangements have been put in place to ensure that speedy decisions can be taken. The powers of direction include the power for a detained ship to be given access to port if a berth is available. However, the Marine Safety Agency does not determine the layout of ports or determine the availability of berths. That is a matter for local port authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point about a vessel being outside a recognised port, the regulations state that inspections can take place at offshore installations such as those in the North sea. I do not know how many inspections have taken place 100 or 200 miles offshore, but if such an inspection took place and a major defect were found, what would happen? Would the vessel then be directed to another port by the inspector or, through his own choice by the master? With such a distance to be travelled, that would be a serious problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is a real issue. To make the matter clear, the rigs are the responsibility of the Health and Safety Executive rather than the MSA. In practice, we have not detained vessels close to rigs. They have generally been detained close to shore or in port, because, as the hon. Gentleman knows, our usual proposition is that vessels are inspected while drawn alongside. We discovered—this is of particular relevance to the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland—that klondikers were deliberately berthing outside port, but close enough to carry out refuelling and other activities, to avoid alongside inspections. Those vessels have been addressed in relation to having a power to detain offshore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From that came the specific concern of the Shetland Islands council and others about the prospects of the vessel therefore being detained in a place where weather conditions were inappropriate. I shall reflect on the point made by the hon. Member for Pembroke to see whether I can offer anything further to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hypothetically, the Braer could have been loading from a United Kingdom offshore installation, and it could have been flagged up that it was a problem ship. Let us assume that it was loaded with 120,000 tonnes of crude and was proceeding through UK territorial waters. Under the regulations, what would happen if an inspector who had been informed that a vessel was going on to an offshore installation or a single buoy formed the opinion that it was dangerous?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer—I shall reflect on it and write to the hon. Gentleman if I miss out anything significant—is that, in general, that would not be the practice that would be adopted because, usually, the vessel would be inspected in port. But if such evidence came to light and it was clearly urgent that it be acted upon, the first thing that the MSA could do would be to prevent the vessel from being loaded. Secondly, it has the power to detain. Other issues about the wisdom of detention on the site would be raised, but the agency has the power none the less. We should distinguish the theoretical from the practical—those circumstances do not generally occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East asked about the defence of all reasonable steps. "All reasonable steps" is a fairly common defence in a number of similar circumstances in which responsibility should not attach to a person who appears to have supervised an unsatisfactory arrangement but can demonstrate that he or she took all reasonable steps to avoid it. I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no intention to allow for resiling from obligations and there is no evidence that the defence has ever been used in such a way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I point out to the hon. Member for Pembroke that regulation 15(3) deals with shoreside operators reporting deficiencies. It lays a specific duty on the port authority to let the MSA know. The hon. Gentleman might say that a berth may be operated by a private operator and not the port authority, but in such circumstances the owner would have a common-law duty to report any apparent illegality. I shall
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
reflect on that point and if there is additional, helpful information I will let the hon. Gentleman know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about familiarity with procedures. I sympathise with his point. There is a requirement in the regulations for a common language—it may not be English—to be deployed. Familiarity with procedures is part of the standard inspection process. The MSA inspector would deal with that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was wondering how much reflection on that previous point the Minister needs. Perhaps he should look at the definition of port authority. Does it deal with the situation? It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'port authority' means a harbour authority within the meaning of the Harbours Act 1964(b), or in Northern Ireland, of the Harbours Act (Northern Ireland) 1970(c), or if there is no such authority, the person having control of the operation of the port".</p></blockquote>
Is that sufficiently wide?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My view is that it is, which is why I referred to paragraph 15(3). It deals with the point made by the hon. Member for Pembroke, but I am keen that we should lay the matter beyond doubt. The Committee understands the point and I shall write to the hon. Gentleman to clarify the point for him, but I believe that he is right—and that paragraph 15(3) of the regulations covers the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final remarks—and I regret that these are necessary—relate to the Derbyshire. I am sure that the hon. Member for Garston understands that I cannot comment on the circumstances of that case, but I reject accusations of any lack of safety concerning any vessel calling into a United Kingdom port, including roll on-roll off ferries. As the hon. Gentleman will know, the British authorities at the MSA and my noble Friend the Minister for Aviation and Shipping, Viscount Goschen, acted with extraordinary promptness at the first suggestion of a need for strengthening of the relevant standards. The vessel concerned was not calling at a United Kingdom port on the relevant occasion. The standard of safety of such vessels is of the finest. If correctly operated, those vessels pose no threat to safe travel and they remain enormously attractive. The argument that safety is always sacrificed to cost by the robber barons of the shipping industry does not bear serious examination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Loyden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was making was that, as everyone would not doubt accept, the most vulnerable part of any vessel—the one that gets all the bashing—is the bow. Roll on-roll off vessels, as the Minister knows, have a bow that drops to allow self-loading with the participation of those who are boarding. The vessel is designed to ensure the speediest possible turn-round. A vessel in port is not making money. It makes money when it is doing something. In the design of those ferries, there is an element of sacrifice of safety standards. It has been accepted, by and large. by the inquiries that have taken place, that ro-ro ferries—while I should not say that they are unseaworthy—are not up to the standards that would today be required for safety at sea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no evidence for the hon. Gentleman's assertions. He is suggesting that vessels
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
with lifting bows are inherently less safe than those whose bows are solid. There may be some obvious truth in that observation, but the hon. Gentleman will recognise that the roll on-roll off ferry is a phenomenon found throughout the developed world, and is a common form of transport. It is important that it should be operated in accordance with the instructions that have been laid down. The inspections following the recent interest showed that the safety levels in all roll on-roll off vessels calling at United Kingdom ports were extremely high and gave no cause for concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have hardly touched on the substance of the regulations. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North is, as I have said, an expert hijacker. If he has one interest in transport policy, I imagine that Dick Turpin would be his role model. I take it from Opposition Members' remarks that they have no objection to the regulations and, indeed, approve of them. That is a curious basis for opposing them but I shelve my natural curiosity about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had no intention of returning to the debate on the matter, but, given the Minister's discourtesy, I feel compelled to do so. He danced a pretty elegant hornpipe to amuse his hon. Friends, although it must readily be conceded that they are not likely to delay the proceedings. He might as well have gone to the Tottenham Court road and bought seven blow-up dolls from the Ann Summers shop, as have brought his hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall) feels insulted, but I have only stated a fact about his, and his hon. Friends' contribution to the debate. I am accused of erecting hurdles that have damaged the interests of British seafarers—or the union of which I am proud to be a member is accused of doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Snape</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister repeats that accusation and says that it was correct. If demanding a decent rate of pay and proper working conditions for members of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers is erecting those hurdles, I plead guilty to it. If the Government insist on British seafarers accepting third-world wages and conditions, the Minister should come clean and say so. Indeed, he should have the courtesy to give way during these exchanges, whether or not he thinks the contributions from the Opposition relevant. It is surely up to you, Sir John, to decide on the relevance of such contributions. The Minister has treated the Committee in a cavalier fashion. I had no idea, incidentally, that he was such an expert on seafaring matters. There are various activities for which the hon. Gentleman is justly famous—most of them admirable. I hasten to add—but seafaring in Garston was not one that I was aware he indulged in.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
During his time in Garston, I am sure that the Minister will have been made aware of the unhappiness of British seafarers and, indeed, British shipowners, given the current decline of the British merchant fleet. It is not only the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers which has made the points that I have been castigated for making this afternoon. I do not know whether the Minister regards NUMAST as a dangerously left-wing organisation, but it has made pretty similar remarks. The Chamber of Shipping has also pointed out the precipitate decline in the British merchant marine under this Administration. I was about to ask whether those organisations had been infiltrated by wicked left wingers from Moscow but, of course, there are hardly any left wingers still in Moscow. So who knows where they came from?

I am sorry that the Minister feels that we were raising matters that were not strictly relevant. His claim that the Department of Transport deserves some credit for the safety of ro-ro ferries rather stretches the credulity of Opposition Members. Many of us remember the Department's back sliding following the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise more than a decade ago and all those tragic deaths—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] If the hon. Member for Ilford, North has something to say, he should stop muttering. Is he selling houses or participating in the work of this Committee? If he has something to say, let him intervene and I shall be delighted, unlike his hon. Friend the Minister, to give way.

It was not the Department of Transport that was responsible for the new safety regime for ro-ro ferries, but the Select Committee, which warned of the dangers of the lack of compartments—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Opposition Members make no apology for fighting for better conditions for British seafarers. We hope
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
that in doing so, we shall persuade at least some of the Conservative Members who share our concern— unfortunately, not many of them are here today— about the decline in the British merchant marine, not least for its effect on future military activity in which it may be necessary for this country to participate. I should have thought that that was another point which the Minister could have addressed, had he not been so enthusiastic about telling jokes to amuse his hon. Friends. The hon. Gentleman has not amused us, and has considerably protracted the Committee's work because of his attitude. Finally, the hon. Gentleman wants his hon. Friends to go about what he describes as their lawful business—well, looking round at them, I shall not comment further on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great shame, Sir John, that the Minister has trivialised a serious and important statutory instrument. I have to say, to correct the record, that it may show how out of touch or demob happy the hon. Gentleman is to imagine that the view expressed by my colleagues and I is one-sided. It is the view of the whole industry, the officers union, the seafarers union and the Chamber of Shipping, many of whose members share our great concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfortunate that the Minister chose to react as he did. We pray against statutory instruments so that the Minister's remarks can go on the record and show people outside the Government's response to these serious issues. As usual, we shall be sending the report of these proceedings in 	<i>Hansard</i> to people in the industry, and they will make their own judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one final thing to say to the Minister: William Gladstone said that the role of the House of Commons is not to run the country but to hold to account those who do. It may be uncomfortable for the Minister, but Her Majesty's Opposition will continue to perform that role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
