	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Erskine Bridge Tolls Extension Order 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 1370).</p></blockquote>
We all congratulate you warmly on your knighthood, Sir Roger. It is nice for us that you are taking the Chair this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that is completely out of order, but thank you very much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Erskine Bridge Tolls Act 1968 set out the initial tolling period at 20 years, commencing on 1 July 1971. The Act empowers the Secretary of State for Scotland to set tolls up to the level that would, over the tolling period, recover the cost of building the bridge and provide for its lifetime maintenance. That is in line with the principle adopted by successive Governments that users should pay for the benefits that estuarial crossings provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However the Secretary of State is not required to set tolls at such a level. It was recognised, even before the bridge was opened in 1971, that it would never be possible to recover the full costs of the Erskine bridge. That is due to the relatively low levels of traffic, the comparatively short distances that traffic would need to divert for alternative Clyde crossings, and the economic situation of the area served by the bridge. A limited objective was set; it was to try to recover a reasonable contribution to the costs of providing, operating and maintaining the bridge while having regard to the economy of the area. These intentions remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1968 Act empowers the Secretary of State to extend the tolling period by periods of five years. He may do that if a sum equivalent to the full cost of building the bridge and providing for its future maintenance has not been recovered during the existing tolling period. As the 1971 tolls were set below the cost of the recovery level, the conditions under which the tolling period may be extended applied at the end of the original 20-year tolling period. Thus, in 1991, the tolling period was extended for a further five years. The order will extend the tolling period for a further five years, commencing on 1 July 1996. We shall look further at long-term financing and accounting arrangements for the bridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that our decision to continue the tolls at their present level for a further five years will be seen as fair. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
	<p>4.33 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, congratulate you, Sir Roger, on your elevation. I am very pleased for you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members check the list of members of the Committee they will see that I am not one of them. I am not here because of a fetish for bridges or extensions of bridge tolls; I am here because my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) is otherwise engaged in the Chamber and he asked me to come here to represent the main opposition party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, this is the second occasion on which the Government have sought an extension of the tolls for Erskine bridge. They increased the toll from 40p to 60p the first time but I am pleased that this time the Minister is not increasing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister freely admitted, the purpose of the toll is not to recover the full cost of building and maintaining the bridge. The tolls are set at below the cost recovery level for a different purpose. I believe that it is to make users pay, in part at least, some of the cost of building and maintaining the bridge. The Government's argument for that is an interesting one. The matter is one of practicality. They are effectively saying that they set the tolls at the level that they could get away with. If they set them at realistic levels that would meet the bridge's costs, no one would use it; people would use alternative routes—as the Minister of State, who happened to be in charge when the extension order was debated, admitted. He made the point clearly, as he did when he said that the reason the Government do not set the tolls at cost-recovery levels is that they realise that they must be affordable to the people living in the area of the bridge who use it. He said that they take into account the economy of the local area. The last time we met the Minister said that had the toll been set at a realistic level to cover costs in 1991 it would have been £2 or £3 instead of 60p. He did not give a figure this time and I wonder if there is an equivalent figure for 1996. Perhaps he will tell the Committee later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policy on toll bridges over estuarial crossings is quite clear. First, they seem to make no attempt to recover the full costs. Secondly, setting the tolls the cost-recovery level is seen as a self-defeating mechanism because it would deter people from using the bridge. Thirdly, they take into account the local economy, which is a fair and fairly consistent policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether we agree with that or not, we have a right to expect that that policy is applied consistently. The Minister argued back in 1991 that large estuarial crossings were so expensive to build that, in principle, tolls had to be levied. That is fine, but surely they should be levied consistently across the whole country. That is where we have problems. The Forth and Tay bridges have a current toll of 80p, the Erskine bridge toll 60p and the Skye bridge toll £10.40 for crossing in both directions. That does not seem to show consistency in the Government's approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister would argue that the Skye bridge is completely different because it was built under the private finance initiative. But tolls have been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
set not just at a full cost-recovery level, but higher, because the company that built the bridge wants to make profits from it. When the previous order was debated my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) was the Opposition spokesman. When he suggested that the Skye bridge, which had not then been built, might levy a £4 toll, the Minister jumped to his feet and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Will the hon. Gentleman say where he got the figure for £4 from? I am not aware of any such figure and would not accept such a figure."—[	<i>Official Report, Second Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments, &c.,</i> 13 June 1991; c.8.]</p></blockquote>
In fact, he accepted a figure that was nearly three times as much. The Minister now argues for a toll of £10.40. He has a clear responsibility to explain to the Committee why the Government have different policies for different bridges covering the same kind of estuarial crossing. The Committee will be interested to hear from him about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has also argued that tolls have to be set at levels which have regard to the economy of the area. I suppose that that means that tolls have to be set at levels that people can afford. As the Erskine bridge crosses the Clyde it covers an area of Scotland with a great deal of poverty. The people are not on high incomes, so a 60p toll on the Erskine bridge might be thought to be reasonable. But how can £10.40 be thought to be reasonable on the Skye bridge given the same circumstances? Skye is in an objective 1 area. It is one of the poorest parts of Europe, yet the Minister expects people crossing that bridge to pay £10.40.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are looking for consistency. Either the Government have a policy for dealing with large estuarial crossings or they do not. We are told that the tolls on the Skye bridge will be limited to the concession period, but tolls on the Erskine bridge are not to be so limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will this be the last extension order that a Conservative Government will bring forward? In the unlikely event that they happen to be in office in five years' time, will they come back with another extension order? The Minister will remember that, when the bridge was originally built, it was agreed to levy tolls on it, it was for a period of 20 years. There was a power to extend that period, but no one realistically argued that it would be extended beyond that time. Many Conservative Ministers, and certainly Back-Bench Members, argued then against the extension. But the point at issue is consistency. That is what we are looking for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the commitment not to set tolls at the full cost of recovery continue? I was alarmed by the Minister's words. I tried to note down his conclusion. He warned the Committee that the Government would look further at the long-term financing of the Erskine bridge. That alarms the Opposition because the Government are withdrawing public investment and support for bridges. The PFI has taken over. Before the end of the five-year extension period, the Government may have other plans for financing and maintaining the bridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authority joint committees looked after the Tay bridge and the Forth bridge. When I was a councillor, I served on the joint board for the Tay road
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
bridge. The Minister is removing that responsibility from councils. He intends to nationalise and bring under Government control the Tay bridge and the Forth bridge. The Government do not nationalise for the sake of it. They bring bridges under their control so that, ultimately, they can privatise them. Therefore, the innocent phrase "look further at the long-term financing of the bridge" contains a serious threat. It suggests that the Government have begun to conside privatising the bridge. I, and other members of the Committee, oppose that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a clear statement of the Government's policy on bridges, and an explanation for the inconsistent treatment of different bridges. Different bridges have different tolls, some are for limited periods, others for unlimited periods. The Minister must state a clear policy. I look forward to hearing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call other hon. Members, I remind the Committee that we are discussing Erskine bridge tolls. It is in order to refer to other bridges and their tolls in order to make a comparison, but not to discuss them in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.42 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ray Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the only Liberal Democrat here, I add my congratulations to you, Sir Roger, on your knighthood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is little to add to the contribution of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). It is inevitable that the order will be extended by yet another five years. When the bridge was opened in 1971, everyone firmly believed that 20 years of tolls would pay for the bridge and that, thereafter, it wold become part of the public highway. It was not generally known that the Erskine Bridge Tolls Act 1968 provided for a Minister to extend the tolls on a five-yearly basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1991, I served on the Committee that made the first extension. As the hon. Member for Dundee, East said, it raised the toll from 40p to 60p. In that Committee, the same Minister told us that, in the first full year of operation, 1.9 million vehicles used the bridge. By 1990, that figure had increased to 6.85 million vehicles. That is a significant increase and the Committee should be told whether the Government have recovered the full cost of building the bridge. If so, what is the income from the bridge today, and what are its annual repair and maintenance costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We require many bridges, especially in the west of Scotland, as part of the road network. Other communities require overpasses, underpasses and spaghetti junctions, but they do not pay a toll to use them. The lesson of the Erskine bridge is ominous for the Skye bridge, which has been saddled with an outrageous toll. I am prepared to bet that that toll will not be lifted and that it will be extended regularly. The Severn bridge compares reasonably favourably with the Erskine bridge, but the Skye bridge does not. It costs only £1.90 to make a single journey across the Severn bridge, whereas a single journey across the Skye bridge costs £5.20.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
As we are comparing bridges, let me ask the Minister if he has any idea when the Creagan bridge will be built, and if it will have a toll. My party believes that bridges are part of the roads network and should be treated as such.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am appalled and astounded that the Government have fallen for this extension. Some time ago, when the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn was Solicitor-General, an inquiry into the matter was held in Dumbarton. The argument advanced by the local and regional councils on behalf of the local community was that the extension should be stopped, the tolls abolished and the road opened up, because the existing situation was affecting the local economy. The Minister mentioned the local economy, but did nothing about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that the local Tories repeatedly say in their manifesto that they will abolish the toll. It is a major embarrassment to the local Tory party that their Government constantly propose the extension of the toll. That is absolutely disgraceful. I tell the Minister that our communities have suffered enough. The community councils have written time and again to the Government, and the local council supported those who agreed against the Skye bridge tolls. It is not easy to separate the issues of tolls and bridges because folk see them in terms of how they affect their community. Many things that have happened to the people of Skye and those in the Kyleakin area are happening to our folk, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have lived in the area for more than 20 years. Although the Government extended the tolls for 20 years, I thought that at the end of that period, the bridge would be free. The proposed extension is absolutely unbelievable. We cannot trust the Government or believe what they say. We cannot accept their contracts because they keep breaking them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember speaking about the toll to a Scottish Office Official, who said, "Well, what are we going to do if we don't get that money?" I asked, "What are you talking about?" The roads network in Scotland is important to growth, which should not be hindered by tolls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our local communities have suffered the devastating blows of unemployment. Local businesses have had to work very hard to keep going, and the travel to work pattern means that people in Erskine have to travel to Dumbarton and other places, and that the people of Dumbarton have to travel to Erskine. The computer industry draws employees from a wide area, and engineers and other workers have to travel as part of their job. The bridge is used heavily and extensively by local people. The £1.20 that it costs to travel across the bridge and back might not seem a lot of money, but it is a lot of money if a person's wages are not very high, and we must remember that this Government are trying to promote a low wage economy. The cost to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
workers of having to travel across the bridge every day comes off their wages every week. That effects the local community, because someone working in the Dumbarton area will not have as much money to spend. The toll is therefore a local tax, being paid by people in the area. Scotland survives on tourism, and those running tourist buses also have to pay this punitive tax to cross the bridge. I am sure that the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Mitchie) would have a lot more day trippers coming to her area by bus if that were not the case. The hon. Lady lives in one of the most beautiful parts of the world, which a lot of people would like to see. To get to Argyll, people have to go on the ferry or cross the bridge. I am sure that the hon. Lady's local shops as wells as the bus companies and their employees would welcome the abolition of the toll. Everybody would benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Government are missing the point that there would be more work as a result. The local community would use that money more sensibly than the Government. There would be better employment prospects and improved infrastructure round about the place, which has so far been denied because of the toll.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken about this matter on a number of occasions. I put down an early-day motion about it, which was well supported and well received. The local community is sick to the teeth of the toll. When will the Government act responsibly by abolishing it and telling us what is going on, instead of creaming off a wee bit from our local communities? It is time that it stopped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am opposed to the toll and will vote against the order. I cannot believe that the Minister has asked for an extension. It is appalling; it is distasteful; and it is letting the people of Scotland down. The Government are not doing their work properly: they are trying to take money away from people who need it to regenerate their economy but who are continually getting kicked in the teeth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I congratulate you on your knighthood, Sir Roger, and on calling my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde (Mr. Graham) to speak before me? The bridge takes off in my constituency, but he argues that because the tolls are on his side of the river, it is his bridge. I see that my hon. Friend agrees with that summary of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I talk about the extension order, I should like to thank the Minister for the unfailing courtesy that he has shown over the years during which we have been corresponding about the bridge. No one so far has mentioned its condition. I think that it is relatively free of repairs at present, but that is very unusual. The bridge seems to have been a bad buy. The cost of maintaining it has been colossal—millions and millions of pounds have been spent. Will the Minister tell us what the future of the bridge is, and to what extent he expects there to be future repairs? Are repairs treated as separate capital building projects and thus

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
not financed out of public money? Or is the expenditure added to the cost of the bridge so that the chances of paying it off are always receding?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has also been helpful to me in another way. Like many other places and bridges, Eskine bridge unfortunately attracts a considerable number of suicide attempts and suicides. Over the years, the Minister has been helpful in trying to increase scrutiny and preventive measures. Distress is caused not only to the relatives of those who commit suicide, but to those of my constituents who live underneath the bridge. I am grateful for the Minister's great helpfulness on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main issue is the condition of the bridge. I may have missed it as I was a couple of minutes late, but I was surprised that the Minister's introduction did not include a financial statement. He made no attempt to say that the Government were getting closer to their goal or getting further from it. The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute has mentioned the substantial increase that there has been in traffic on the bridge. It is true that people criticised the bridge in the early days as a white elephant. I never agreed with that—it is a superb route. It certainly is not a white elephant now. There is considerable traffic now, much greater, I am sure, than was anticipated when the bridge was built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We appear, far from getting near, to be getting further from any kind of resolution of the issue, as my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde has said. Here we are again, being asked for an extension on unknown terms. The Minister has not said that the capital debt on the bridge is being paid off or is expected to be paid by such and such a date, after which there will be no tolls. Is it the Government's policy that the people of the area should pay for the bridge in perpetuity? That would be a different policy from that under which the bridge was built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong for us to have in perpetuity because the bridge is of considerable use. The Minister can compare the difficulty of going from my constituency, or from Dumbarton, to Greenock using the tunnel rather than the bridge. One can see just how useful the bridge is to local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I thank the Minister for how he deals with specific issues as the roads Minister, I feel that there is a vacuum in today's statement. What are his intentions and the Government's intentions? What is the financial position, and when does he expect the cost to be paid off?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the Minister, I should thank hon. Members for their kind personal remarks. I hope that I do not prejudice the impartiality of the chair by congratulating the Minister on his elevation to the Privy Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Roger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) asked for financial facts and I shall start by making those clear. Accounts are published annually and are available to the House. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
accumulated deficit has risen and stands at about £130 million. Our underlying principle is that users should pay for the benefits as long as that is not to the deteriment of the surrounding economy. The cost of the bridge has not been recovered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked how much the toll would have to rise to recover the cost. That is an impossible question to answer. If the toll were put up to a high level, people would use the Clyde tunnel or the Kingston bridge and would not cross the Erskine bridge. That would be self-defeating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the public should make a reasonable contribution to the cost of building, operating and maintaining the bridge. A review of the toll levels will be carried out over the next year. A review of the duration of the toll will also be conducted. No decision on either has yet been taken. The order merely maintains the toll at its existing level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister assure us that in reviewing toll levels the Government will take the condition of the Kingston bridge into account? Given the congestion on that bridge and on the M8, it would be foolish to raise the toll on the Erskine bridge. That would be a disincentive to using the bridge when it is in the interests of us all that more people use the Erskine bridge in preference to the Kingston bridge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises a relevant point. The Kingston bridge is in need of strengthening. An enormous number of vehicles use it and the strengthening will be expensive. If the toll were to be removed from the Erskine bridge about £2.2 million a year would be taken out of the Scottish trunk roads programme, which would mean that projects that other hon. Members want to go ahead in their constituencies would be delayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Extensive maintenance has been carried out on the bridge because it was required. That demonstrated the need to maintain toll income to help to cover the cost. There is no reason to believe that the maintenance has not been good value for money. Some of it has helped with the problem of suicides. Like the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie I am very much in the business of prevention and discouragement. We want to make it as hard as humanly possible for anyone to go down that path.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde mentioned lack of trust. The Erskine Bridge Tolls Act 1968 made allowance for extensions, the criteria for which were set out in the Act and have clearly been met. The tolls have not recovered the cost. The hon. Gentleman may not agree, but there has certainly been no breach of trust. I accept that the bridge offers substantial benefits to the local area but it is only right that users should contribute what we believe to be a reasonable amount. Our objective is to recover a reasonable amount, having full regard to the economic situation of the surrounding area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister had any communication about the bridge from the new Renfrewshire authority or from the local community

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
councils? Over the years, everybody has asked for the tolls to be abolished, yet there has been no response at all. Surely the views of local people and their elected representatives should be taken into account, as well as the views of community councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any recent representations, but obviously there are calls to remove tolls throughout Britain, which would of course cost countless millions of pounds. That money would have to be raised through taxation or by borrowing or other means. I want to make it clear that we fully intend to take the needs of the local economy into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute mentioned Creagan bridge. Subject to availability of funds, we intend to proceed with the project in 1997–98. The hon. Lady is right that 1.9 million vehicles used the Erskine bridge in 1971, the first year of operation, rising to 6.85 million by 1990. In 1995–96, the figure was 7.9 million. The cost will be maintained at 60p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Dundee, East asked whether we would continue to take the needs of the local economy into account. We shall certainly do so. The toll on the Skye bridge is no more expensive in real terms than the ferry—in fact, it is slightly cheaper. There are different circumstances, because the bridge offers substantially improved services to the people of Skye.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the most recent extension, it was agreed by successive Governments that users should pay something towards the cost. We shall consider
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
objectively the long-term issues. I cannot say what the outcome will be but, as hon. Members have noted, there is no increase at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bridge was built from public funds. All the different toll bridges in Britain have slightly different toll regimes. The Local Government Etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 gave powers to ensure consistent management of the Forth and Tay bridges in the trunk road network but there are no plans to change the existing arrangements. The situation is not identical on the different toll bridges throughout Britain. We think that the action taken regarding the Erskine bridge is reasonable, and I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
