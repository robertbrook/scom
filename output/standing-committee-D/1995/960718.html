	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the Landfill Tax Regulations (S.I., 1996, No. 1527).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, Mr. McWilliam. I am glad that some of us have made into Committee this morning through the traffic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall confine my comments to the Landfill Tax (Contaminated Land) Order 1996. As has been said repeatedly on the Floor of the House of Commons and during consideration of the Finance Act 1996 and of the relevant statutory instruments, we accept the principle of a landfill tax. The proposed exemption for contaminated land is the result of considerable lobbying by various industries. There is much contaminated land and many brown-field sites in this country. It is important to take brown-field sites into account when considering future developments, including housing and leisure developments in city areas, where most brown-field sites are found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposed new section 43A will exempt the disposal of waste material that is removed from land for which a certificate was in force unless the disposal was required by enforcement notices, which are issued under various environmental Acts. If the land is to be built on, the disposal must be completed before construction starts. In other instances, the exemption will cease when the pollutants have been cleared sufficiently to allow the reclamation to be completed or the potential harm to be removed. The new section states that exemption for clearance of materials from one part of a large site will be allowed even if construction has started elsewhere on that site. That matter should be clarified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposed new section 43B governs the issue of certificates. Reclamation must be carried out with the object of
	<br><blockquote><p>"facilitating development, conservation, the provision of a public park or other amenity, or the use of the land for agriculture or forestry".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Reclamation must involve clearing the pollutants that "cause harm". I hope that the Minister will discuss the definition of "harm". After consultations showed that the originally drafted definition was too restrictive, we no longer have a clear definition. I hope that the definition that is adopted will not be too widely drafted and that we will not go from one extreme to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give clear undertaking that exemptions relating to contaminated land will be an interim measure. The order also deals with short-term issues. The aim of landfill sites is to encourage recycling and better waste management. Will that principle underpin the proposed strategy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the absence of support for means of reclaiming land on site and research into the technology to develop that, we simply transfer pollutants from one area to another. It is hard to see how that contributes to the wider objectives of landfill tax, which is to reduce pollution and to encourage recycling and sensible environmental behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A working party of the Environmental Industries Commission specifically examined the question of contaminated land. It looked at existing technologies, and those that will become available in future as a result of on-going developments, to enable the remediation of land on site rather than having to deposit it elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are currently three basic methods of treating contaminated land. Current Government policy favours the containment of contaminants on site, or the excavation of the material and its removal to a licensed landfill site. The third method is to clean the soil, groundwater and underground water by using various technologies to remove the contaminants. Will the Paymaster General give some indication of his intentions in respect of those technologies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
World wide, the problems of contaminated land and the development of environmental technologies to deal with it give rise to an enormous potential for jobs in this country and for export of technological know-how. We must ensure that any interim measure that we provide for dealing urgently with contaminated land does not undercut the long-term objective. Will the Paymaster General tell us how he envisages the measure before us this morning fitting in with the Government's overall strategy to encourage recycling?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Paymaster General intend to review the operation of this measure in one, two or three years with a view to determining whether it is working successfully, or whether it is discouraging individuals and companies from undertaking remediation of land and encouraging them to continue to move it around the country? I am not suggesting that such a review should be provided for in the statutory instrument, but such a review should be carried out to ensure that the landfill tax is operating correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Paymaster General tell us how this exemption interplays with the provisions relating to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0678">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
environmental trusts and the moneys made available through that trusts for research and development work on ways of dealing with waste management? Given that contaminated land is one of our biggest problems, it would be unacceptable to provide an exemption that cut across the principles behind the environmental trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my remarks go beyond the subject of today's Committee, but it would be helpful to the Committee if the Paymaster General told us how the exemption fits in with the provisions relating to the environmental trusts and the encouragement of technologies that help us to deal with pollution. If he is able, will he indicate the Government's thinking on possible additional measures to maintain the pressure for the development of environmental technologies to deal with pollution?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Environmental Services Association—representing the people who run the landfill sites—has raised some points on the issue. Waste such as rubble or topsoil which is not required by those who have accumulated it but which is of use to cap the top of a landfill site—every landfill site must be capped every night—is currently available free to site operators, but it appears that under the regulations they would be exempt from the tax only if they had paid commercially for the material. If that is so, I am sure that it is a drafting error. The regulations may cross-reference with other statutory instruments on landfill which I have not been able to find.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the issue was discussed on the Floor of the House and during considerations of this year's Finance Bill, the Government made clear their intention that no landfill tax charge would be made to companies which recycled materials regarded as waste by another company. It is now unclear whether that still applies to site operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to funding through the environmental trusts for the development of technologies to deal with pollution rather than just moving pollutants around the country in a containment exercise, but there is the further issue of money available to some local authorities through social regeneration bids currently provided for through the Department of the Environment. Many local authorities are in partnerships with companies to work on such regeneration bids, which often involve having to deal with contaminated land before development in inner city areas. We must be sure that such funding will not be weakened or considered unnecessary because of the provision to take the contaminates away and put them somewhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That also raises the issue of European funding, which is available in the same circumstances. There is not a great deal of money available, but the reasons for making an application could be undermined if the Government send out the wrong signals, encouraging companies to scrape up pollutants and bury them
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
somewhere else without being charged landfill tax rather than deal with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of praying against the order is to air our questions, even if we receive no answer, so that those of us who are committed to the landfill tax can be sure that its ultimate aims are to encourage recycling, the change people's behaviour and to reduce waste and pollution in our communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Jeremy Bray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Motherwell, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would be convenient to ask the Minister some questions. I should like to pursue some of the points which I raised on the qualifying materials order under the mistaken assumption that they were relevant on that occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The biggest reclamation site in the country—the Ravenscraig works—is in my constituency. It contains 1,000 acres of contaminates land and 1 million tonnes of material to be moved. The work is about to start, with the cooling towers being blown up next weekend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a jaundiced experience with delegated legislation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am having difficulty in hearing the hon. Gentleman. One conversation in the Committee Room is enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Bray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. We had a jaundiced experience with delegated legislation during the closure of the steel works. The termination of the iron and steel employees rehabilitation benefit scheme was so tortuously drafted that it created anomalies when other steel works closed later and longer serving employees did not qualify but shorter serving employees did. That was unjust, and it was not until we initiated a judicial review that the Department budged and conceded the point. I am anxious to avoid such a situation arising in the clearance of a site under the landfill tax order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The landfill tax is a minor cost consideration in relation to the overall cost of reclamation and redevelopment, but, unfortunately, it can screw up the entire procedure if people wish to delay projects or are not prepared to accept liabilities because of lack of definition of the effect of the tax. It is important that the issues are clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concern is with a large site owned by British Steel. An adjacent site—the Lanarkshire site—used to be owned by British Steel but is now owned by Scottish Enterprise and has been cleared for some 16 years, but to a standard which leaves it contaminated by modern standards. There is a permanent leachate problem from old mine workings under the site into which waste was pumped by British Steel and its predecessors to dispose of it. That waste included cyanide, which was simply pumped into old mine workings. That leachate will have to be fed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0679">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
permanently to a water treatment plant, and British Steel has accepted liability for that. It is impossible to distinguish between that leachate and leachate from the contaminated material that remains on the surface.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A secure containment facility will be built on the part of the site containing the bulk of the material. The reclamation and redevelopment will be phased and it is hoped that part of the site will be redeveloped before the rest of the site is cleared. The developers do not know what they will find when they start to move the material. There were steel works and mining sites there for many years before Ravenscraig was built but no proper records were kept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That proposed section 43A of the Finance Act 1996 would terminate the qualifying period for exemption from payment of landfill tax as soon as construction begins. Does that mean that as soon as construction begins on one part of the site, the qualifying period for exemption will terminate on the whole of the site? How will that affect an adjacent site, which might use the same contaminated material facility on the Ravenscraig site where it is under separate ownership?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposed section 43A(5) grants exemptions to land owned by particular development authorities, including Scottish Enterprise but not British Steel. Scottish Enterprise owns an adjacent site and material may be dumped on the Ravenscraig site, which is owned by British Steel. Will that be exempt under proposed new section 43A(5)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposed new subsection 43B(9) appears to allow partial development of a site. Does that mean that the rest of the site will be exempt when the relevant material is cleared? Furthermore, what is the interaction between the qualification criteria contained in subsection (9) and the problems that are raised by the termination of the qualifying period, which is contained in article 3? That is a problem because the uncertainties are considerable, but the matter is made more difficult by the way that the order is drafted. It distinguishes between a qualifying period, the issue and phasing of licences and the uncertainties surrounding different stages of a development. I look forward to the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Mr. David HeathcoatAmory)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have battled through the traffic to get here. Those of us who made it owe no thanks to the trade unions—they endeavoured to stop us from travelling. We all hope for a resolution of the dispute, which would ensure that our deliberations are even better attended in future. We are debating important matters, and it is right that the orders should receive parliamentary scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the support that the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) extended to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
exemption of contaminated land. It is right that we do nothing to inhibit the development and reclamation of contaminated land. I deliberately use the phrase "contaminated land" rather than "derelict land", which is a more general concept that might bring forth claims for all sorts of exemptions that it would be impossible to control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady mentioned that the definition of harm in the order had been widened a little. We did that in response to consultations that we carried out. I must make the general point—especially in relation to the speech of the hon. Member for Motherwell, South (Dr. Bray)—that we consulted carefully throughout the process. The landfill tax was first announced by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the 1994 Budget. We have had a good length of time in which to discuss the details with those who will operate and pay the tax, and we have altered our proposals in response to the validity based criticisms which were put to us. The definition of harm has been relaxed somewhat to give the word a more natural meaning, which will allow a degree of additional flexibility when applications for simplification and exemption are being considered. Nevertheless, the overall definitions are sufficiently rigorous to prevent abuse. Doubtless my Department and Parliament will keep an eye on the way that the tax unfolds in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned that land must be contaminated to qualify. The material that is removed from a contaminated site is potentially dangerous, and it will be disposed of only to a registered site that is governed by environmental law. It would not be right simply to shift toxic material from one part of a site to another. The exemption will apply only to material that is being safely disposed of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bristol, South alluded to several interesting developments in soil washing and bioremediation that offer alternatives to clearance and landfill, but at present they are generally expensive. Were we not to exempt contaminated land so as to encourage such alternative treatment possibilities, the real effect would be to deter the reclamation of contaminated land. The review after two years will include examination of the progress that has been made and whether alternative treatments, such as soil washing, have become sufficiently economic so that it might be appropriate to reconsider the exemption for contaminated land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bristol, South also mentioned environmental bodies. The term now applied is bodies rather than trusts because it can apply to the wider range of organisations that will be set up by site operators. The significant reduction in operators' landfill liability—there is a 90 per cent. offset—will fund their donations to those bodies. That has direct relevant to our debate on reclamation of contaminated land in that one of the approved objectives of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0680">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
bodies' schemes is research and development of remediation techniques. That will give an extra fillip to the development of alternative techniques.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received representations in respect of site operators' use of soil for capping waste. Material brought in specifically for site engineering will not be taxable because it is purchased for that purpose. Much of that material is used either to line or cap sites. Waste material that is used for site engineering will be taxable because it is desirable to keep the tax as simple as possible. It will not always be clear whether waste arriving at a site is to be used for site engineering. A general exemption based on use would create great complexities for site operators and, indeed, enforcement problems for Customs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not that point contradict the provisions added to the Finance Bill by Government amendment whereby waste material that is capable of alternative use can be stored for a certain period—up to six months or 12 months, I think—and then re-used? If used within that period, the material will not be subject to the tax—if not, it will be liable. That contradicts our telling site operators that they cannot re-use material unless they have paid for it, and it cuts across the recycling process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There appears to be a contradiction. I do not understand why, if we can manage complicated matters such as certification of the decision on whether waste is £2 or £10 a tonne, or whether it is harmful and should be moved, we cannot deal with a small point relating to landfill site operators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with two different issues. The aim of the contaminated land exemption is, as I have outlined, to exempt certain types of material which are desirable for redevelopment from certain types of site. Provisions relating to material received by site operators for their own purposes, including daily cover of the landfill site and the eventual capping of the site, will affect all site operators. It is reasonable that material purchased for site engineering should not be taxable but that material received in the normal course of business should be taxable, particularly when there are alternatives to the use of soil for daily cover, such as paper pulp or hessian which, I understand, are environmentally benign and prevent landfill sites from being filled up with soil. It is obviously objectionable in principle that ordinary soil should be used for landfill when alternative uses such as landscaping are more appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A landfill site operator storing material under the storage provisions in another section of the legislation and then disposing of it after 12 months would presumably not be liable for tax even though the material had been used to cap the site. When we debated the tax we agreed that if material
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
that could be re-used was stored, it would not be subject to the tax for that period of storage. It now appears, however, that such an operator will be liable for the tax on material that is being recycled if that material was not paid for. That does not seem logical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, there is a confusion between material received with the object of recycling at a later date and material received for daily cover or site engineering. Those are two different uses and it is not helpful to confuse them. The temporary storage of material that is to be taken away and reclaimed as part of a recycling exercise falls into a separate category from material used for site engineering. That distinction is clear in the regulations.

The hon. Member for Motherwell, South mentioned the reclamation project at Ravenscraig. I assure him that the different ownerships to which he referred will not inhibit the awarding of the certificates necessary to exempt contaminated soil or any material on the site. If I heard his description correctly, it will all qualify as exempt material under the terms of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked specifically about the interaction between section 43B(9) and the end of the qualifying period as set out in section 43A(3). I am advised that those are separate issues. The point of section 43B(9) is to ensure that the removal of pollutants can qualify for exemption even if some of the pollutants remain in the ground, provided they are at a safe level. It also ensures that the exemption can still be claimed when contaminated soil is moved to a safe containment cell on the site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked why British Steel is not mentioned in section 43A(5). I am advised that that subsection deals with bodies issued with remediation notices. British Steel has no such notice. I hope that that clarifies the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned partial developments and asked whether the reclamation of part of a large site would automatically mean that all the material removed from that site or adjacent sites would qualify for exemption. That is not necessarily the case. For example, if a motorway was built through a contaminated site, it would obviously be appropriate to exempt the material extracted from the area of contamination but not the entire development project of miles of motorway. Customs would narrow the exemption to that part of the site which was clearly contaminated. However, Customs will be reasonable. If the majority or a large part of a site is contaminated, the certificate will apply to all the material removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Bray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say whether development can go ahead on part of a site while there is contaminated material elsewhere on that site waiting to be removed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Customs must issue a certificate within 30 days of the application. That will

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
give security and assurance to developers. They will not have to start a development still uncertain as to whether they will have to pay landfill tax on material moved from elsewhere on the site. The provision will therefore not inhibit the reclamation and developments that the hon. Gentleman is anxious to encourage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Bray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If different parts of adjacent sites are in different hands, the problems caused relate not only to current ownership but to transfer. British Steel wants to get shot of the site as quickly as possible and some developers want to get going as quickly as possible. Many permutations relating to timing and the terms of transfer of liabilities are possible. I take it that the Paymaster General is telling us that all landfill tax considerations are irrelevant to such a situation and that the transfer of ownership of any parts of the site during the period of reclamation will have no effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is always difficult to lay down the tax liability of a specific project from the Dispatch Box or in Committee, so I am hesitant to give a definitive view on which parts of the Ravenscraig project will be exempt from landfill tax. I can offer the general assurance that for a phased development, as a project of that magnitude must be, the whole site will be certified. There will be no inhibition on developing it in stages. Clearly, only the waste from the reclamation stages of the development can be treated as exempt. Administratively, Customs will issue a certificate on the larger development. If the hon. Gentleman cares to contact me directly, I shall ensure that attention is paid to the need not to inhibit the development of Ravenscraig simply because of a change of ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Pearson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dudley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the Minister could clarify some of the implications of the order for my constituency. Dudley is part of the black country, in which there is much contaminated and derelict land. Most of the brown-field sites which are earmarked for development will be classified as contaminated land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bearing that in mind, does the Minister believe that there will not be a problem of developers being able to obtain certificates for contaminated land in the black country so that they will not be hindered from bringing forward development proposals? Is the order good news for the black country and certain well-known developers there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Olner 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nuneaton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are one or two matters that the Committee should tease out of the Paymaster General. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South said, no one is against recycling or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
anything that may improve our environment. The introduction of the landfill tax gave an impetus to recycling and so on instead of simply dumping material in the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to research and development and the Environmental Industries Commission, which has expertise in the reclaiming of land. It sells that expertise abroad and gains revenue from that, but I wonder whether any cash from the landfill tax will go to potential developers so that balanced decisions can be made on whether land should be cleaned up—the available technologies are expensive—or whether waste should be dumped in a landfill site. More money needs to be put into the system to provide balance so that the cost of cleaning land reduces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still confused and hesitant about the problem of materials that are not exempt but are properly used in existing landfill sites where domestic refuse may be taken in. The materials and domestic refuse should be covered daily, not only to help the sites, but to help the environment for those who live near such sites. As tax will have to be paid on daily site cover material, operators may try to cut corners and perhaps endanger the environment of those who live nearby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On storage, will the Minister say whether dumped colliery waste will be exempt? In my constituency an old clay hole was filled with colliery waste and about 10 years later that colliery waste was reclaimed. Would it be legitimate for the coal industry to dump its waste with a view to reclaiming that waste later if technology improves?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.13 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to the hon. Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson), everything that the Government are doing is good news for the black country. It will encourage the development of brown-field sites in the area, not by direct financial subsidy, but by exempting contaminated land. That will not apply to all derelict land because developers would become adept at claiming that sites on which they want to build are derelict. Vacant spaces are almost always derelict to some degree. Areas of the country containing sites left by past industrial developments will now be helped to the extent that those involved in developments on those site will not have to pay for the removal and landfilling of contaminated land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner) asked about research and development. Inasmuch as those activities are carried out by environmental bodies set up under the relevant legislation, they will receive direct cash boost. Site operators will set up environmental bodies funded by donations: 90 per cent. of the cost of donations will be offset against the landfill tax bill paid by the site operator, up to 20 per cent. of the operator's total tax bill. We estimate that up to £100 million will be available for that purpose.

Details of the credits are set out in the landfill tax regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the more general point about landfill sites that receive household rubbish and so on, taxing the disposal of such material will mean that there is a direct and clear economic incentive for the development of alternatives—for example, the reduction of such waste through recycling measures such as the recovery of aluminium cans. Inasmuch as that reduces the volume of household or other waste, there will be a reduction in landfill tax liability. Were the tax to lead to fly-tipping or other such practices, that would be firmly dealt with under environmental law. I assure the hon. Member for Nuneaton that colliery waste is exempt—we discussed that in an earlier part of our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to press the Paymaster General on the question of landfill sites and the use of demolition and construction waste for the purpose of capping. I want him to reconsider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, landfill operators accept free of charge materials that can be and are used for engineering purposes. That is completely in accord with the Government's strategy, "Making Waste Work". To suggest now that operators will be taxed for doing that seems somewhat short sighted—that is the kindest description. In addition, such use of demolition and construction waste is consistent with the Department of the Environment's 1994 report entitled "Managing Construction and Demolition Waste". That report concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The recycling of demolition wastes may currently be a financially marginal operation. If constraints are to be removed and the recycling of these wastes to be encouraged, it must rely on the acceptance of the principle of sustainable development. This means that all opportunities"—</p></blockquote>
I emphasise, all opportunities—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the promotion of re-use and recycling of materials should be pursued where they can substitute for primary materials."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
To tax operators unless they pay for the materials will encourage them to use primary or virgin materials. That goes right to the heart of the principle behind the landfill tax—to encourage re-use and recycling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that there has been a drafting error, but it seems absurd to have a tax on which we all agree and, at the heart of its operation—the question of where we dispose of waste material—introduce a policy that contradicts its basic premise. I ask the Paymaster General to reconsider. He will find a number of contradictions within the various regulations, and of the clear policy line laid down by the Department of the Environment in its strategy documents, to which we all subscribe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tax will indeed help the recycling industry because recycling is one way to avoid the landfill tax. For example, a developer who produces large quantities of builders' rubble would—if the rubble is inert—be taxed at the lower rate, but a tax would still be involved. If the rubble can be recycled and reused, the developer will avoid the tax altogether. The tax will assist all those who are involved in the production of waste and it will encourage them to make better use of the huge quantities of industrial waste that are produced each year in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
