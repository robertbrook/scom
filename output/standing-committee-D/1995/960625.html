	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Ipswich Port Authority Transfer Scheme 1996 Confirmation Order 1996.</p></q>
May I say what a pleasure it is to refer to you as Sir James? I am sure that your many hon. Friends on the Conservative Benches have been doing so for years—certainly, I have done so, and it is nice to know that I have got it right at last.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will enable the Secretary of State to confirm the transfer of the assets, rights, liabilities and duties of the Ipswich Port Authority to the private sector. All property, rights and liabilities of the authority and all functions conferred or imposed on it by any local statutory provision will then be transferred to the successor company set up by the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In furtherance of the general objectives of the Government's policy for ports, the Transport Act 1981 enabled the transfer of the nationalised harbour undertakings of the British Railways Board and the British Transport Docks Board to the private sector in 1981, and of Sealink in 1984. The abolition of the dock labour scheme in 1989 enabled many ports to modernise their working practices and take advantage of up-to-date cargo handling technology. Those actions released competitive forces that had been dormant for years and led to great improvements in productivity. Other ports, including trust ports, had to respond to new competition and become more competitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are more than 100 trust ports in the United Kingdom. Many have their origins in the middle ages, but the legal status of most of them is determined under private Acts of Parliament passed last century. By the end of the 1980s, some trust port authorities had come to see that their position could best— indeed, perhaps only—be developed by moving into the private sector. At the beginning of this decade, ports such as Tees and Hartlepool, and Forth started to pursue the lengthy and expensive private Bill process required for such transfers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To enable that process to be done less expensively, the Government introduced the Ports Act 1991. The 1991 Act is an enabling measure, providing a simpler and quicker mechanism than the private Bill procedure for trust ports to privatise themselves. The 1991 Act allows the Secretary of State to compel the larger trust ports to privatise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedure for both types of privatisation is similar. A scheme is drawn up for the transfer of a trust port's undertaking to a Companies Act company formed by the vendor port authority. The scheme must be confirmed by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
order. In the case of compulsory privatisations, parliamentary approval is needed for the transfer order. The subsequent sale of such a company into the private sector, which requires the consent of the Secretary of State, completes the privatisation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers of compulsion under section 10 of the Ports Act 1991 enable the Secretary of State to consult the board of any trust port with an annual turnover of more than £5.6 million to ascertain its views on privatisation. Last June, my right hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Dr. Mawhinney), the then Secretary of State for Transport, consulted the Ipswich Port Authority. The authority was given three months to respond with its views. On 7 November, following the authority's submission, the Secretary of State wrote to the chairman to direct the authority to form a successor company and to prepare a transfer scheme to enable the authority to transfer all its property, rights, liabilities and functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ipswich Port Authority met the requirement within the Secretary of State's timetable and subsequently published the required notice, inviting representations to the transfer scheme, and the memorandum of association of the successor company. In fact, only one representation was received, which related to matters appropriate for consideration during the working up of the sale documentation. The scheme submitted closely followed the model that the Department of Transport provided, and the few technical amendments now incorporated in the scheme, which appear as a schedule to the order, have been agreed with the Ipswich Port Authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board of the authority originally informed us that privatisation was not in the best interests of the port. However, I understand that, subject to parliamentary approval, the authority will proceed with privatisation expeditiously, as it considers that that will be the best way to remove uncertainty about the future of the port and increase the confidence of potential customers needed to replace ones lost to competitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall start on a good note by congratulating you, Sir James, on your recent elevation. Likewise, I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The good news ends there. This is a sad occasion in parliamentary history, as it is the first time that we have compulsorily privatised a port in the United Kingdom. It is not a happy precedent, and I hope that my hon. Friends, particularly those from the north-east, will ensure that it is a unique occasion, rather than one that recurs when we come to discuss the port of Tyne.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the discussion proceeds, I shall try to clarify the reasons for the great rush towards the compulsory privatisation of the port of Ipswich. One of the main reasons must be evident to anyone who has visited the port, as I have: the enormous property bank which attaches to that asset. That raises the question why anyone should wish to bid for the port. I shall deal with that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am certain that my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Cann) will want to speak in the debate. He has added to his already high reputation as a constituency Member of Parliament by leading the campaign against the privatisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is pretty rich for the Minister to say that although the people in the port initially opposed privatisation, they are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0647">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
now happy about it because it removes the uncertainty. He omits to say why the uncertainty arose in the first place—because the Government placed the port in the awful position of having to decide yes or no to privatisation and perhaps see business go down the river, as prospective customers could not be reassured about the status of the port in one year or two years. The uncertainty was entirely the Government's responsibility because they forced the port to be privatised, against the will of local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The confirmation order is the dog-end of the privatisation drive of the 1980s. The port is one last victim of the increasingly unfashionable dogma of the Thatcherite years. That trend has peaked and people are beginning to reassess the ideologically driven interests that once propelled Mrs. Thatcher and her cohorts into power. It is no consolation to Ipswich or to Tyne to be the last man to pop his head above the parapet and be shot before the armistice is declared—before the Government are turfed out. We owe it to the constituents in those areas to ensure that the arguments are made today. That is what we intend to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are pushing the expropriation through against the interests of the port, its customers and the wishes and needs of local people. I choose the word "expropriation" carefully. There are other words, and stronger words were used in the other place yesterday. "Theft" was used there several times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for such language is that the port is not the Government's to privatise. Hitherto, there have been ideological differences, but the legal basis has never been in doubt. Where the Government own an asset, they are at liberty not to own it—to privatise or denationalise assets under their control. They may do so as the sale of the century, or with sweeteners or give-aways, or by underpricing, if the assets are theirs to dispose of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this asset does not belong to the Government; it belongs to a trust, held by a group of people based in Ipswich.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope, Sir James, that we get injury time for the break that we have had as I know that a number of my hon. Friends want to catch your eye.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am taking careful note of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the way in which the Government had expropriated those assets. Lord Goschen said yesterday in another place that a trust had no legal owners. One could almost hear the salivation of Ministers at such a phrase. Not ones to miss an opportunity, they are now seeking to sell this asset of Ipswich port and to gain 50 per cent. of the proceeds. If someone does not even own an asset in the first place and then tries to make money out of it, that is as close as one can get to expropriation or theft and still remain on this side of Her Majesty's prison walls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are trying to do that covertly. The provisions under which the Ipswich port is to be sold are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
not even in the order that we are debating today—so much for parliamentary scrutiny. The future of the port lies at the mercy of the Secretary of State's discretion in deciding which tender to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wholly within the remit of the Secretary of State to make that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich has ably represented his constituency and has led the campaign against privatisation. If we were to accept that the port has to be sold, would Ipswich borough make money from the sale, as it has created much of the asset? I bow to my hon. Friend's superior knowledge, but I understand that the port has existed within the borough since about the 13th century. People in the borough have put in 700 years of effort and additional work to make the port a success—and that is in addition to the assets and grants that have been given to it. Will those people be beneficiaries of the sale? The port is probably even older than the 13th century. There are rumours that it is Roman—again I must bow to the historical knowledge of my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The borough of Ipswich is receiving not one penny out of the sale. The Government have abandoned the initial criteria that they set for themselves in selecting Ipswich, Dover and Tyne as targets for forced privatisation, Ipswich was in the top three ports for turnover at the time of the original decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) who I think is Chief Whip—[	<i>Interruption</i>] He may be expecting some news because he is smiling in acknowledgement at my mistake. He was the Minister who proposed the measure in the first instance. He will probably break the omerta of the Whips' offices—I hope that two other colleagues on the Opposition Benches might also do that today. Does the Minister agree that the original criterion was to target the ports with a turnover of more than £5 million? At that time, Ipswich was one of the top three big hitters, but that is no longer the case. Ipswich has fallen down the league, not least because of the loss of the two shipping lines in recent years to Tilbury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the justification for pressing on with the sale, other than the fact that the Government are running out of business and steam and cannot turn round their own ideology at this late stage? There is also the waste of assets to consider. I understand that lawyers' fees, accountants' bills, the cost of consultants and all the other hangers-on in the Goverment's privatisation record will total £887,000. What an absolute waste of taxpayers' money when the port was functioning perfectly well and was profitable. It was never requested by any authorised body that the port should be privatised. I repeat that the sum of £887,000 will be given away in fees and consultancy bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich will no doubt elaborate further, but the effect of running down a port and creating the atmosphere of uncertainty that has hung over Ipswich in recent years will have a knock-on effect in terms of local job losses. It does not involve just those who work within the confines of the dock wall, but those involved in haulage in and out of the docks, marine solicitors, insurance companies, and all the other industries in and around Ipswich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have seen the figure of 1,500 people in connected trades, but again my hon. Friend may have more up-to-date figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0648">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
One thing is certain—Ipswich is a microcosm of all that has been wrong with the Government's policy on marine matters. I am conscious that there are some experts in the Committee, but I know that in the wider area of merchant shipping we are in danger of losing the critical mass that can and has come about in the shipping industry. That will have tremendous knock-on effects on shipbroking, shipping insurance and related activities, which create invisible earnings for us. That problem in Merchant shipping—which the Labour party will address when it is in Government—is writ small in Ipswich. If the port loses its critical mass because of the uncertainty that has been created by the Government, the knock-on effects on local industry could be catastrophic for an already high unemployment rate. The last thing Ipswich needs is an uncertain future, least of all one that threatens to strip its assets, offers no guarantee of a buyer with a genuine interest in the port and a sell-off process that could take 18 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do the Government want to introduce confusion and uncertainty into the business? The rationale behind the scheme cannot be the recovery of recent losses, as the port's management—which I commend—has already moved ahead with redevelopment plans and found new trade since the loss of business to Tilbury. When I visited Ipswich, I was very impressed at the energy with which the management team had set about recapturing markets and business. It is doing a superb job and has the full support of the local community. It needs to be backed in doing that job. It should not be spending time writing documents for a sale and being on the phone chatting up lawyers, accountants and consultants; it should be getting on with the job that the trust has asked it to do, which is to make Ipswich a thriving port again. What a diversion of all that energy the scheme will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rationale cannot be to streamline working practices. Under new management since 1992, the port's managerial and labour practices have improved efficiency and increased productivity. I pay tribute to Alan Howell, the chief executive of Ipswich, who has done such a superb job in that respect. Nor can the rationale be to improve accountability; because as a trust port it is already accountable to its customers, employees, the board and the Department of Transport. It cannot be to free up its commercial activity, as it is already able to form joint ventures, to develop and dispose of property, to invest outside the port and to borrow up to £30 million. Nor is it to generate competition in a country that has already been described as an "over ported" nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme is far from expressing respect for local interests that have existed for centuries. There is no evidence whatever of local support for privatisation. The Minister was being disingenuous in claiming that, somehow, there was now support for privatisation within Ipswich's management. Yes, it wants the agony of uncertainty to end, but the Government have put it in that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far from there being support, local representatives have shown considerable concern at the prospect of privatisation. They are legitimately worried that once privatised and removed from any sort of democratic control, the port may be run by a company with a minimal interest in Ipswich. It is quite possible within the terms of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
the memorandum that, in certain circumstances, the company might not be run as a port at all. There is a wide variety of other criteria for running the company and maximising assets. We all know what that means, especially in a property-rich asset like the port of Ipswich, which is in a prime position in the centre of the town. The memorandum of association contains no requirement for Ipswich port to continue the great progress already made, in association with Ipswich borough council and others, on projects for the redevelopment of the older parts of the port for non-maritime functions, such as housing and leisure, recreational and educational activities and for associated services, including transport facilities. Those projects are vital to the successful rehabilitation of large areas of Ipswich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The port of Ipswich covers almost all the Orwell estuary, including the shoreline classified as being of outstanding natural beauty. There is no guarantee that the authority's efforts towards environmental improvements will continue. Ipswich could end up losing all round. There is no requirement for local representatives to be on the new company board to safeguard those interests. The board currently contains a local representative, but there is no provision for that to continue under the new arrangements. Neither is there any provision for a consultative committee in the area to oversee the activities of this new entity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are the Government proposing this measure? Is it too cynical to suggest that it is the last chance for privatisation measures to be railroaded through so that the ports can be handed over to their new owners ready for asset stripping ahead of a general election? The Government may have bowed to public pressure and a concerted campaign by the Labour party when they decided to delay the privatisation of the port of Dover, but they are using this enabling measure, intended for voluntary privatisations—let us not forget that—to force the trust ports of Ipswich and Tyne into sell-offs. Their action is disingenuous and they are ignoring the advice of all those in the know, of those local to Ipswich and of those who care about the future of the port. The same arguments will be made again, if necessary, when we discuss the port of Tyne.

The Government are forcing through this privatisation against the clear judgment of the port, the local authorities and all interested parties locally. What they are doing is wrong, it is unrepresentative and is not in the interests of the port and its consumers. We will take great pride and pleasure in following the lead of my hon. Friend for Ipswich and will vote against this measure if it comes to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I support the principle of privatisation and always have. I am sure that the fears expressed by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) will never be realised. We only have to look back at British Steel and British Airways to see what happens when privatisation rejuvenates an old industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that I have been called before the hon.

Member for Ipswich. I had the pleasure of serving with him for more than a year on the Committee considering the Channel Tunnel Link Bill. The hon. Gentleman smiles: we sat longer than the Committee considering the Great Western Railway Bill, did we not? It was an exhausting experience. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North paid tribute to him for his work as a constituency Member of Parliament. I would like to pay tribute to his predecessor, Michael Irvine, who was widely respected in the House and who served his constituents very well. I am not saying that I was not happy to serve with the hon. Member for Ipswich, but I would have been equally happy to have served with his predecessor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always supported the principle of privatisation. However, I have received representations from Peter Odell, who is the chairman of the Ipswich Society, and I thought that I owed it to him at least to give him a hearing and ask him about his concerns. I gave an undertaking to raise some of those concerns this afternoon. I am not trying to remove a large slice of the speech of the hon. Member for Ipswich. I am sure that some of the brief points that I shall make will be covered by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the hon. Member for Nottingham, North railing against privatisation. He accused the Government of being ideologically driven. My memory may be failing, but I seem to recall that the hon. Gentleman came through the union movement and so his whole career has been based on ideology. He may be the captain of the House of Commons cricket team, but I wonder whether he was playing a straight bat when he said that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to stray from the main matter and be called to order by you, Sir James, especially as you have now been elevated to the knighthood. The points raised by Mr. Odell and which appear in the briefing concern three matters. First, there is anxiety about the measure's effect on the progress of the redevelopment of the older parts of the port. Leisure and transport facilities and educational and other ancillary activities feature in this privatisation measure and I hope that consideration is given to them. The proposed economic activities for the Victorian wet dock areas seem to cause particular anxiety. I cannot speak with the authority of the hon. Member for Ipswich, but I see that the hon. Gentleman is nodding his head so I assume that he supports what I am saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point concerns the timing of the proposal. The port of Dover was granted a stay because of the channel tunnel. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is not often that one of my hon. Friends tries to blank out part of a speech of mine by the devious tactic of slamming a window. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will tell the Committee why a similar stay is not possible in the case of Ipswich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point is to do with the millennium fund. If the privatisation goes through now, I understand that Ipswich port will not be able to apply for funds from that source. That would be a great sadness. I do not know the port well, but clearly everyone has heard of Ipswich. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to persuade the millennium fund to make some concession in the special circumstances that obtain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that privatisation is in the port's best long-term interests. Felixstowe sucks work, jobs and transport from Ipswich and from places as far away as Liverpool, where an old-fashioned union dispute has forced yet another company to move its work away.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Hon. Members disagree, but the story that has appeared in the newspapers is that obdurate unions, sitting beside 40-gallon drums and insisting on old working practices, have forced a major company to turn its back on Liverpool—just as major companies turned their backs on Southampton and Jack Dash wrecked the London docks. The same thing is happening all over again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that privatisation will benefit Ipswich and, when I have heard from hon. Friend the Minister, I look forward to the measure being agreed to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jamie Cann 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ipswich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forgive me, Sir James, but this morning my glasses decided to collapse on me. What I am wearing is not a new design: I just hope that they—like you—will hang on in there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I enjoyed the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North, who made a convincing argument. Ipswich was not a Roman town, but Saxon. It was founded in about 810 and was burnt down four times by the Vikings between 960 and 1012. It was rebuilt again each time—and was still relatively pro-Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to thank the hon. Member for Bosworth (Mr. Tredinnick) for making some of the points that the Ipswich Society circulated to members of the Committee. I remind him and you, Sir James, that the Ipswich Society represents 1,000 people of all political persuasions in our town. It should be listened to seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's debate is not about the principle of privatisation, which I do not intend to discuss, but whether the port should be compelled to privatise at this specific time. I should like to tell hon. Members who are doing their correspondence that that is a serious matter. I, too, have sat in Committees on delegated legislation—for example, that which considered the draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes of Income) (Uzbekistan) order 1996—and done my correspondence while the poor Front Bench spokesman was speaking. This Committee is not the same, however, because we are considering a measure that will affect many of our fellow citizens. I hope that members of the Committee will listen carefully to the arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ports Act 1991 was an enabling measure that allowed trusts to privatise if they wanted to. I have no objection to that, but the sting in the Act's tail was that it conferred power of the Minister to compel privatisation if he so wanted at a later date. I do object to that. We should also remember that the aim of the 1991 Act was to extend competition in the ports industry. Again, I have no particular problem with that. However, there is no need to import competition into the ports industry nowadays, since it is a knife fight out there for every port. Rates are being driven downwards by shippers who are quite prepared to move at the drop of a hat, so the Government do not need to make provision to stimulate competition in our ports, nor to privatise the port of Ipswich to make it more competitive. It already lives in an extremely competitive environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to tell some hon. Members that the Committee is not a sub-Committee of the Cabinet, a team meeting of Department of Transport Ministers, or the Ipswich Port Authority board. It is a Committee whose duty is to scrutinise the Government's proposals.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
I hope that members of the Committee will carry out that function responsibly rather than follow the party Whip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Ports Act was passed in 1991, I was a locally picked non-executive director of the Ipswich Port Authority board. Of course, when I became a Member of Parliament I had to leave that post. The board had far more Conservative members than socialists, indeed, I was the only socialist, though I concede that at least some of the Conservatives had a social conscience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the board considered the Government's proposals in 1991-92, it concluded that privatisation could not bring a single advantage to the port that it did not already possess. It could already borrow large amounts of money, as my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North pointed out. It could manage its own property; make substantial profits; take out loans; it was financially liquid, locally accountable and operated well. Why spend money on privatisation when it is unnecessary to enable the business to compete? That was the board's unanimous decision; it did not want to privatise. Until last year, matters were left like that. The Government then decided to compel Ipswich port to privatise despite its wishes. That was on 19 June 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that Ipswich was grouped with Dover and the port of Tyne when the Minister decided to consider direction. It is a mystery to me how the largest of the three, Dover, dropped out of the frame, while Ipswich and the port of Tyne remained in it. The fact that Dover has a Conservative Member of Parliament clearly has nothing to do with the matter. Will the Minister tell us, therefore, what criteria were used? The only criterion that arose following the 1991 Act was that ports should have a turnover of more than £5.6 million, and Ipswich, Dover and the port of Tyne all met it. Suddenly, however, Dover dropped out of the frame. What criterion allowed Dover to drop out while Ipswich and the port of Tyne remained in the frame? If the Minister tells me what the criterion was, I shall try to ensure that Ipswich meets it. At present, however, that is impossible because no one knows what it is—perhaps even the Minister does not know, although he might prove me wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The IPA was put in a quandary. Ipswich is not a rich port and the longer the issue drags on, the more it will cost. As the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North said, the longer the matter goes on, the more it costs and the worse it is for Ipswich. We need to end the uncertainty that the Government have caused by dithering and then putting Ipswich into the frame. That uncertainty has lasted since 1991 and has had a severe effect on trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall stop the privatisation today because this is our last chance. If it goes ahead, however, it will cost the authority, which already has problems, more than £800,000. Privatisation is not necessary to increase competition or to break a monopoly—there is perhaps no other reason for it than to put a little money in Government coffers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether Ipswich is privatised is not a question of national importance and will not decide when the election takes place or who will be in Government. It will not impact on this country's trade: if the port is well managed, it will take trade from other ports; if it is poorly managed, it will lose trade to other ports. The privatisation of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
Ipswich port is less important nationally than whether we win against the Germans on Wednesday. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is far less important—at least according to the local newspapers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is fundamental to the area. The people of my town do not want to lose a trust port that they have had for so long. Ipswich borough council and, as the hon. Member for Bosworth noted, the Ipswich Society have opposed the proposal. The Ipswich Port Authority also objected to it when it felt able to and I objected to it in an amicable conversation with the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ipswich people oppose their assets being taken away. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Does the Minister—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cann</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can tell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I surveyed Ipswich people on the matter in a middle-of-the-road ward. I and 10 of my colleagues knocked on every fifth door—or every sixth if someone was out—to find out what people wanted to happen to the port. We asked three questions. First, we asked, "Do you believe Ipswich port should lose trust status and become a privatised port?" Of those who responded, 90 per cent. opposed the proposal. Secondly, we asked, "If Ipswich port is privatised, should the proceeds go to the Government?" Again, 90 per cent. opposed the proposal—where the 10 per cent. came from is beyond me. Thirdly and crucially, we asked, "Do you think that whoever buys the port should be covenanted to continue to operate it as a port?" Again, 95 per cent. of people voted in favour. Essentially, nobody locally wants our port to be privatised. Everybody of any real influence in the town does not want it privatised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ipswich has had a port for almost 1,200 years. In 1200, we got our charter from King John and the port was so important to Ipswich then that a ship became part of the town's shield. Ipswich port has survived in business since 1200 when we got our charter. I read in 	<i>The Times</i> the other day that the average private sector company survives for 70 years. The port has proved its capability to move and adapt with the times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to conservatives in Committee—conservatives with a small "c", like me in many ways and with a big "C": if something is not broken, why mend it? Why change something that has clearly lasted the test of time and continues to do so? Why alter that? What sense is there in doing so? I appeal to members of the Committee to vote against the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Fabricant (Mid-Staffordshire)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the arguments presented by Opposition Members. I especially noted the laconic style of old Labour in the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, who said that there was no need for privatisation. Almost in the same breath in an earlier sentence, the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Ipswich spoke about how Ipswich has fallen down the scale in the knife battle between ports. In fact, mention has been made several times of the fact that turnover has dropped from the £5.6 million threshold to around £3 million. That demonstrates the very reason—the whole sine qua non—of why, sadly, Ipswich needs to be privatised.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
If the hon. Member for Ipswich does a survey in Ipswich and asks, "Would you support privatisation if that meant that Ipswich port would be sold off and our history which goes back to Saxon times would be destroyed?", I can well understand that people would say, "No, we don't want that." Indeed, were I living in Ipswich, I would say the same thing. However, the hon. Gentleman forgets that the legislation states quite clearly that the port's use cannot be changed without the sanction of Parliament. For old Labour, the hon. Member for Nottingham, North shakes his head in disagreement. I hope that the Minister will confirm in his summer-up whether I am right—that any change will need the sanction of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the new owners, should such a thing come to pass, decide to maintain a bare minimum statutory definition of a port—I do not know whether that means a pair of steps leading to the sea—and flog off everything else, they will meet the statutory requirements of the order. Clearly, people are not queuing up to buy the port of Ipswich in order to pump millions of pounds into it to reinvigorate it. They are queuing up to asset strip a prime asset in the middle of the city of Ipswich. I hope that the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire (Mr. Fabricant) understand a little more about how a port can be defined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not only laconic, but sneering and ill-informed. The Minister will confirm that the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood the statutory instrument—I am amazed that a Front-Bench spokesman has not read the statutory instrument or the main primary legislation to which it refers. The hon. Gentleman is completely wrong. If steps leading to the sea could be defined as a port, that would make a nonsense of the Bill. That is not the case, as the Minister will confirm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ipswich said that he was the only socialist present when the matter was discussed. I am not sure where that puts him in new Labour—I thought that socialism was banned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman compared Ipswich with Dover, but I do not believe that the comparison is apt. Dover is a prime port that meets all the criteria and therefore has not been privatised. The problem with Ipswich, as the hon. Members for Ipswich and for Nottingham, North both pointed out, is that in the cut-throat battle between ports, Ipswich has been losing out. Let us not forget that British Airways was far from being the world's favourite airline before it was privatised. I find it depressing that the hon. Member for Ipswich has so little confidence in the management and the people working at the port that he believes that if the port were privatised, it would not go back up the scale and once again attain a turnover of £5.5 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, North asked for safeguards. Those exist in the order. I see no reason why the Opposition should oppose it. Those on both sides of the Committee should support it, primarily to support the long-term life of the port of Ipswich. Whether it is in public hands or in the hands of a trust, a port that is continually losing business to other ports will not survive. For the sake of continuity and for the sake of Ipswich, I shall support the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Chidgey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastleigh)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am almost overwhelmed by the oration of the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire (Mr. Fabricant), but I shall try to draw my thoughts together. The nub of the issue is that the Government are using the Ports Act 1991 as a high-speed vehicle to privatise the port of Ipswich with undue haste, as some hon. Members have argued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the contribution of the hon. Member for Ipswich, who must know better than any other member of the Committee the impact that privatisation would have on the community. He made some telling points. We know that the 1991 Act was originally introduced to assist ports that wanted to privatise themselves, because of the formidable and probably unacceptable costs that they would have faced if they had pursued private Bills to achieve that aim. That was a welcome and helpful move by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present issue is the use of the powers of compulsion under the 1991 Act. The Secretary of State is using those powers to compel Ipswich port to be privatised. The comparisons made with the British Railways Board and with the British Transport Docks Board are somewhat spurious. The comparisons referred to nationalised ports that already were the property of the state. Ipswich port is not the property of the state; it is held in trust and has been serving the community of Ipswich for many centuries, as we heard. It should be for Ipswich and its community to decide the future of the port.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transfer scheme under discussion represents the first attempt under the Ports Act 1991 to transfer a port compulsorily into the private sector. We should examine carefully the implications of our decision today. It is not a knock-about issue. We must make an important decision, and we should consider carefully the implications of compulsorily transferring a port into the private sector against the wishes of the local community and, equally important, against the original wishes of the Ipswich port authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard how, for 700 years, the port has been the centre of the development of commerce and industry in Ipswich—a long and glorious history for the people of that part of the country. The port has been nurtured and supported by the local community and by local traders, who have invested in the port and its business over many centuries. The assets and land of the port are integral to the future development of the town of Ipswich and the community that it serves. The agreements that have already been reached by the IPA for residential and leisure development and for commercial schemes stretching decades ahead are vital to the future success and prosperity of Ipswich and its community. All that would be placed in jeopardy, if the order were to come into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's scheme permits the transfer of all the assets accumulated over the centuries to a successor company with no commitment to the people of Ipswich. The successor company will have no obligation to use the assets to the benefit of the local community and commerce; its obligation will be to its shareholders and directors, who might be based anywhere and have no interest in Ipswich. The people of Ipswich will be allowed no representation in the management of the successor company's affairs. Furthermore, the assets, with all their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
potential for the essential development of Ipswich, will be sold off purely for the benefit of the Treasury. What the Treasury might want to do with the money is another question, but the essential issue is that the assets will become the property of the Treasury and there will be no compensation for the people of Ipswich who have worked for and developed that port for so many centuries. That has been called a clear example of daylight robbery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in the Liberal Democrat party do not support the concept of compulsory privatisation of ports. Having listened to the arguments, I have concluded that the only sensible thing to do is to vote against the order. I hope that other hon. Members, having heard the arguments, will have the foresight and sense of justice to do the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Clelland 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tyne Bridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends, especially my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich, have put our case clearly. I want to dwell on one aspect of this case. In his opening remarks, the Minister referred to the period of consultation required under the Ports Act 1991 before the privatisation of a port—in this case, the port of Ipswich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the 1991 Act, the authority and other interested bodies should be consulted. The period for that consultation should be 42 days from the publication of the authority's proposals so that interested organisations can put forward their views. There should be a further period of two weeks so that the authority can comment on counter-proposals that the Secretary of State might put forward, after which there should be another 42 days for consultation so that interested organisations can comment on the Secretary of State's proposals, if they are published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee must ask themselves what the House and the other place had in mind when they agreed to the sections on consultation in the 1991 Act. I am sure that it was not the intention of either House that the consultation should be some sort of formality that need not be taken seriously. The hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire referred to the wishes and intentions of Parliament in his usual, extraordinary contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nowadays, the Government treat the 1991 Act as a sham; the consultation period apparently means nothing. The submissions received from the authority, local authorities, port users and other interested bodies show that they overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to privatise the port. Conservative Members should take note of that. I know that some of them have attended the Committee to do their correspondence and to make up the numbers until it comes to the vote. However, we should consider what the Houses of Parliament had in mind when they agreed to the section in the 1991 Act on consultation. Today, we have an opportunity to honour the intentions of both Houses of Parliament when that Act was passed and to take proper account of the views of those who responded to the consultation exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bosworth referred to the privatisation proposals for Dover, as did the hon. Member for Mid-Staffordshire, who referred to it as a prime port. Ipswich and Tyne port, to which we shall refer later, were apparently regarded as secondary ports in comparison to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
Dover. Contrary to the belief of the hon. Member for Bosworth that the Government's change of mind was brought about by considerations involving the channel tunnel, that was only part of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that objections from Dame Vera Lynn and Her Majesty the Queen Mother had some weight in the Government's change of mind on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If these objections were good enough for Dover, the weight of opposition to the privatisation of Ipswich should carry the same weight with Conservative Members. We should support those who know the port of Ipswich and what goes on there. They have expressed views based on knowledge and what is in their own interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years, Conservative Members have voiced their objections to what they refer to as the nanny state. They say that the state should not tell everyone what to do and that people should have the freedom to make choices and to do their own thing. Local people made clear their choice, and what they believe to be in their interests, but along comes the Conservative nanny state saying, "We know best. Regardless of what you say, we are going to privatise this port." I hope that if some Conservative Members—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It was their views and local interests that they wanted to know about.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Nick Ainger 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be brief, Sir James. I have some experience of the matter, as the Minister knows, as there is a large port in my constituency which, thankfully, is not—at the moment—scheduled for privatisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly describe the port and its history to illustrate and confound some of the points made, especially the opinion that private ports are wonderful and trust ports or publicly owned ports are useless and cannot compete. There are three separate ports in Milford Haven: the Port of Milford Haven, which is run by Milford Haven Port Authority, the Milford Dock company and the port of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0653">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
Pembroke. The Milford Dock company was created by an Act of Parliament in 1880 and until six or seven years ago was quoted on the stock exchange. It was facing bankruptcy, had to be bailed out by the Milford Haven Port Authority and is now wholly owned by that trust port. So much for a private dock company being a success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second port, the port of Pembroke, is a more recent addition to the operations in Milford Haven. It was created by a group of companies based in Pembroke dock, which in effect built a new dock. Within one year of opening it went into liquidation. It is now a trust port, managed on behalf of the liquidators by the Milford Haven Port Authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those two illustrations show that just moving something from the public sector to the private sector does not necessarily mean a good operation. We should remember, too, what happened in the first wave of privatisations following the Ports Act 1991, especially the Medway fiasco. The management decided that it wanted to privatise the port, which it did. Within a year or two, a number of dockers were persuaded to sell their shares in the company and take a redundancy package. Within a few months, the company had been taken over by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board and the chief executive and other senior executives were able to benefit personally to the tune of some 12 million. That is the sort of outrage that can happen when a trust port is privatised —it can find itself at risk from vultures that want only to strip its assets. Other problems have been identified by my hon. Friends the Members for Ipswich and for Nottingham, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was amazed that a Government apparently so much in favour of self-government for various bodies and institutions should refuse to listen to a body such as the Ipswich Port Authority. That experienced authority has made it clear that it does not want privatisation, yet it is being forced in that direction by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to delay the Committee, but I worry that we have a Government who say that organisations should have greater choice and independence yet who compel an organisation, for no good reason, to pursue a privatisation that will cost a significant amount and achieve nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall begin by picking up where the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger) left off. It would have been possible to find, in every debate preceding the privatisation of a publicly owned company, phrases exactly similar to those deployed today by Labour Members. In those debates, the costs of privatisation would have been cited as somehow wasteful—yet there would have been no mention of the fact that those costs were miniscule in comparison with the probable benefits from the sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those debates would also have contained allegations of theft, as though the taxpayer—who would have been the recipient of the levy on the sale proceeds—was not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
involved in the matter. In fact, the taxpayer is central to the ownership of publicly owned assets.—[	<i>Interruption</i>] As my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Staffordshire remarks so accurately from a sedentary position, there is the gravest risk of the Opposition's opinion being that all property is theft—a ludicrous proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's approach to this measure is right. The entire history of the past 17 years of the formerly nationalised industries bears that out. Conservative Members—like the world outside the House—are convinced of that. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North is usually perfectly responsible, but he made the extraordinary assertion that privatisation is a redundant philosophy. I know that reality is never allowed to intrude into the hon. Gentleman's marvellous little socialist stronghold, but the truth is that the virtues of privatisation, as propounded by my noble Friend Baroness Thatcher, have been taken up across the free world. It has even been taken up in those places where the nonsense expressed by Labour Members used to be advanced as a serious political philosophy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister name any other asset that has been privatised which the Government have not owned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the extraordinary proposition that somehow the Government are not entitled to a levy on the proceeds of sale. The hon. Gentleman should be careful before throwing around his accusations. The Government are entitled to receive a levy on the proceeds of sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advantages of privatisation are, frankly, obvious and I am astounded by the hon. Member for Pembroke's assertion that the Government believe that private ports are wonderful and trust ports are lousy—his exact words. The reality is that Conservative Members would never make such a crass assertion—that workers in the private sector are either intellectually or morally superior to those who work in the public sector. That is offensive to millions of hard-working and conscientious men and women who are employed in public sector enterprises or in the administration of public affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Privatisation is not about any miraculous transformation from man to superman, but about liberating companies from the constraints that are placed on them in the public sector by statute and allowing them to perform as other commercial companies perform—to be able to borrow towards their business plan, to exploit their assets, to stimulate development, to dispose of surplus land, which is difficult under current legislation, to diversify more easily, and to introduce substantial employee ownership. Those are the advantages of privatisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Opposition Members have not learned anything from the past 17 years, they should go back to the days when the Chief Whip of the Labour party was railing against the decision to dispose of British Airways, describing it as an industrial tragedy and a commercial disaster that would haul the Government to their early grave. That, together with other ludicrously inappropriate assertions made by Labour Members, has ground into the dust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall provide one example to underline my straightforward observation. The hon. Minister for Ipswich referred to generous borrowing powers. Having

been in business for the past 30 years—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How successfully?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman wish to intervene? I thought that he did, but perhaps he thought the better of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot resist the invitation. The hon. Gentleman referred to the glory of free enterprise in the private sector and the inefficiency of public sector industry. Will he tell us more about the brilliant success of his own business under Thatcher rule and over the past few years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I have no doubt whatever about the success of businesses—my own and others—under the leadership of my noble Friend Lady Thatcher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have to tell the Minister that that is out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What a great shame, Sir James. I was beginning to enjoy myself. However, let me make one important point to the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn). It comes from the heart. Having the ability to borrow is very different from persuading someone to lend —an observation of such breathtaking simplicity that I can understand why it might have escaped Opposition Members. The reality is that the banks will have difficulty with operational assets, which cannot be put up as security because they cannot be disposed of. The difference between the Ipswich Port Authority as presently constituted and the IPA under its new owners is that the private company will have share capital against which borrowing can be secured. For many reasons, there is much difference about present prospects for investment in the port.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Cann</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take up one of the points that the Minister has made. First, he referred to the nationalised industry, but the Ipswich Port Authority is a trust. The non-executive directors were appointed by the Government from the business sector. It operates as a company in all its borrowing, spending and buying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will the Minister please tell me what the privatisation will liberate Ipswich port from? As far as I know, it does not need liberating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, Ipswich Port Authority has never had a problem borrowing money—indeed, it has been offered more money that it wanted to borrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, what criteria were used to decide that Dover should not be privatised, even though it is larger than Ipswich?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly happy to deal with those questions because they are straightforward as, I should have thought, are the answers. Ipswich will be liberated from the statutory constraints on its ability to develop, borrow, diversify, dispose of surplus assets and pursue many other courses of action. I am astonished that the hon. Gentleman should be detained by such an obvious proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
I shall deal in a moment with the three ports that have been mentioned in our debate—Ipswich, Dover and Tyne. It is perfectly legitimate to ask why they have been treated differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, however, I should deal with the central issue of whether the town of Ipswich was entitled to receive sale proceeds. It is true that the town owned the port for many centuries, although the port was silted up by the time the town gave up its ownership. The hon. Member for Ipswich might have noted that, under the Ipswich Dock Act 1852, Parliament handed the port to the commissioners—the predecessors of the present port authority—at the end of the last century. Parliament also provided for the port's upkeep by enabling the commissioners to levy dues and charges on port customers. That revenue from the customers here and abroad provided the today's port facilities and infrastructure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The logical conclusion is that the port is a public economic asset, not a specifically local one. In those circumstances, Parliament decided in 1991 that it was appropriate for the national taxpayer to receive a 50 per cent. levy on the sale proceeds from the disposal of trust ports, the balance of which is retained by the port. That is perfectly straightforward and contrasts markedly with the proposition of the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, who gave an embarrassing display of old Labourism, which will have done his chances in the modern Labour party no good. His thinking is unfashionable in today's Labour party, and I should warn him that his colleagues are all privatisers. Even his smart red tie might soon set tongues wagging in some of the more liberal Islingtonian circles. The suggestion that we are dealing with legalised theft is absurd and I shall not detain myself with it further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bosworth raised concerns that the Ipswich Society had brought to his attention. One crucial issue concerns present and proposed development under the new regime. The purchaser of the port will have access to equity and will be better placed than the port authority to fund the development of port infrastructure and ancillary areas. A purchaser is unlikely to neglect the development of his new assets any more than happens in existing commercial ports. The development of non-port activities will be subject to the same planning controls as other developments. The port authority's financial position does not allow it much scope for activities such as housing development, although proposals have been under consideration. The opportunities that are available to the new owners to pursue such developments are likely to be substantially greater than those currently available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some concern has been expressed about the allegation that the sale might be an opportunity for asset stripping. I emphasise to the hon. Member for Nottingham, North that a change of use cannot go ahead without legislative sanction; a port cannot be closed or substantially run down without the consent of Parliament. An Act of Parliament would therefore be required to close a port. The Secretary of State has powers to amend the operation of a harbour, but he does not have the power to relieve the authority or a successor company of its duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall address the point that I am glad that 95 per cent. of those canvassed in Ipswich agreed was important: if land were sold off by new owners, the Government would be able to claw back a proportion of the value of such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0655">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
sales up to 10 years after the date of privatisation. So there is no prospect of any asset stripping that would disadvantage the public purse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for clarity, the hon. Member for red tie—the hon. Member for Nottingham, North—said that a port would be a port even if it were just a stepladder down to the sea and that the aim of Parliament could thereby be diverted. Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I draw my hon. Friend's attention to the specific words that I used: a port cannot be closed or substantially run down without the consent of Parliament. If the new owners, for an extraordinarly perverse reason and in circumstances of which I cannot conceive—given the extent to which asset stripping is denied them—decided to adopt such a course, Parliament and the Secretary of State could intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not expect the Minister to answer this point today, but before we discuss the future of the port of Tyne, will he refresh his memory about the definitions of a port and of operational land pertaining to a port? He would then be able to make it absolutely clear—if not today, when we discuss other forced privatisations—that operational land surrounding a port can be redefined, often making a nonsense of the definition of a port as we would understand that word and that former operational land can be asset-stripped and built upon in one of the 30 ways specified in the memorandum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman a detailed answer in relation to any of the lands contained within the area of the present IPA; there is no issue about which the Government feel uncomfortable. The hon. Gentleman would be the first to agree that what is important is that the port should be allowed to flourish commercially and that where port owners and operators—whether in the public or the private sector—identify spare or redundant land that ought more properly to be deployed elsewhere, they ought not be denied the opportunity to develop it appropriately. That is precisely what will appertain once the new owners take over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chidgey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made a great deal in his speech, entertaining as it always is, about the port of Ipswich being currently free of restraints. Does he include in the category of restraints, the agreements that have been reached between the IPA and the borough of Ipswich on the future development of port lands that are surplus to port operations? If he considers them productive rather than restraints, what covenants or commitments will he show us to ensure that the new arrangements are carried through under the successor company?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very straightforwardly, any proposition for the development of land, for example, within the borough of Ipswich would require planning consent. The borough, entirely appropriately, retains its powers to consent or otherwise to such development, while the owners have mechanisms available to them to seek to develop either by consent or on appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to such agreements as have been entered into by the port authority and the borough council, to the extent that they are binding agreements, they will clearly be binding
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
on any successor. To the extent that they were a concordat or other informal agreement, it will be open to the new owners—as, indeed, it would be open to any successor board to the present one under public control—to reach such other agreements as they feel to be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) has made some surprising comments. To be fair to him, he is the only left-winger among Opposition Members and so he is entitled to say such things. One has to look to the Liberals these days to provide a bit of genuine socialism—there is little enough left of it on the Labour Benches. I forgive the hon. Gentleman for making those absurd propositions but to the extent that he is concerned, I assure him that he has no need to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister be generous enough to give way again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would indeed be generous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gives way in his usual generous way, for which I thank him. Does he accept that to asset strip and then to give the Government 50 per cent. of the proceeds is still asset stripping? Would he undertake to consider whether, if assets are stripped from the port of Ipswich, the 50 per cent. that goes to the Government can go back into the development of that port or other ports?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot accept the hon. Gentleman's proposition, but I shall not detain the Committee because I have only a few minutes in which to deal with outstanding points raised by other hon Members. As I said, I have dealt with the question of the legitimacy of the proceeds. I am content that in the circumstances, it is right that the Government should excercise their levy on 50 per cent. of the proceeds of sale in recognition of the fact that since the Ipswich Dock Act 1852, when Ipswich transferred the port, the public purse has funded any developments that have taken place there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bosworth asked about the millennium fund. A proposal has been under consideration for a museum-cum-visitors centre, referred to as the Gyppeswyke Centre. There is also a proposal to redevelop the wet dock part of the harbour, and the centre would be well suited for that central site. The Ipswich Port Authority has been keen to pursue that redevelopment proposal if it can be made a project of proper and adequate commercial value to the port. I understand that English Partnerships is still evaluating the possibilities of that proposition. I emphasise to my hon. Friend and reassure the Ipswich Society that there is no reason why a commercial proposal cannot be carried forward at the same time as privatisation is implemented and no reason why the successor company should not be expected to continue with such a commercial development. I can understand why concern has been expressed, but there is no basis for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all fairness to Opposition Members, I am obliged to deal with the relationship between Ipswich town and Dover. The Secretary of State made it entirely clear that the crucial fact that distinguishes Dover from Ipswich is the opening of the channel tunnel. Since it was opened, the position of the port of Dover has been almost uniquely affected. It is not yet clear, however, precisely what that effect will be. There are those who have suggested that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0656">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
nature of the traffic that is likely to be carried by the tunnel will be significantly different and that therefore, in general, Dover is likely to be unaffected. Others, however, have argued that the effect on Dover will be substantial. Suffice it to say that it is clear, in the circumstances, that it is not an appropriate time to bring forward a proposal to transfer Dover into the private sector. There would be every prospect of a heavy discounting of any potential value in relation to any such proposition. That is entirely right. Crucially, however, the board itself has undertaken to privatise itself and to bring forward plans to do so in 1997. Therefore the suggestion that Ipswich is suffering a penalty that Dover, because it has a Conservative Member of Parliament, has escaped, is as absurd as it is disingenuous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cann</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that hon. Members will have noticed that Dover is not to be privatised until after the last possible date for a general election. Is the Minister really telling us that Dover is the only port on which the channel tunnel has had an impact? Does he not realise that it has had a ripple effect all round the coast in the east and the south-east?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is perfectly aware—I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not mind me saying that the Secretary of State is more aware than he is—of the effect of the channel tunnel. I emphasise the fact that prospective bidders for the port are likely to discount the value of Dover because of the uncertainty surrounding the advent of the new and significant infrastructure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Right hon. and hon. Members who represent constituencies in the area of Tyne port will appreciate that the position there is rather different. The scheme submitted by the Port of Tyne Authority does not accord with the advice given by the Secretary of State and cannot be made to do so by any modifications that it is within his power to make. Thus that scheme will not come before Parliament. Instead, the Secretary of State proposes to make his own scheme of transfer under section 12 of the Ports Act 1991 and is currently consulting the Port of Tyne Authority about that proposal. It is too soon to say when a section 12 scheme will come before Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clelland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sense that the Minister is about to conclude his remarks. He has not yet referred to the consultation process, which I mentioned. He said that the Secretary of State is consulting the Port of Tyne Authority. What is the purpose of the consultation, given that the Secretary of State has, until now, completely ignored the results of the consultations on the privatisation of the port of Ipswich and on the continuing privatisation of the port of Tyne?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State consults on a propostion, which is that the port of Tyne should be privatised. In so doing, he wishes to obtain the views of those with an interest in such a proposal. He wants to know what impact they believe it will have on the port and what comments they have on the desirability or otherwise of amendments to the process as proposed and efficacy of its implementation. That is perfectly proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is too experienced a parliamentarian to assume that the specific power contained in section 12 allows the Secretary of State to make his own scheme for the Tyne. The scheme advanced by the Port of Tyne Authority did not accord with the requirements of, or advice given by, the Secretary of State. In such circumstances, the Secretary of State will not simply take a straw poll of those consulted and be bound by the outcome. That would be an utterly disingenuous proposition, and whatever else the hon. Member for Tyne Bridge may be, he is not that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is content that the purpose of consultation is to determine how best to give effect to the proposed scheme. The argument is not that he has acted improperly. If the hon. Gentleman has specific concerns about any part of the consultation process, he may wish to raise them with me after the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
