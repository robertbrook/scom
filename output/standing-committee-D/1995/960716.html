Draft European Parliamentary Constituencies (Scotland) Order 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft European Parliamentary Constituencies (Scotland) Order 1996.</p></blockquote>
May I say that the Boundary Commission was totally independent, that there are, to the best of my knowledge, no burning issues and that I shall be very happy to answer any questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Salmond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Banff and Buchan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that the commission was independent. My party has no objection to its proposals—indeed, we are perfectly content with them. I wish only for it to be noted that if Scotland were an independent country, it would be discussing 16 seats in the European Parliament, not eight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John McFall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a privilege for me to speak here today, particularly in the company of the honourable Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond). He rarely attends Committee sittings, so we are privileged by his presence today.<br><br>
I accept the independent statement of the Boundary
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Commission for Scotland. My party has no objections to it, and we thank the commission for its work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can reply in two sentences. I shall not be tempted into a major debate on the arguments for and against Scottish independence. The commission considered all the arguments very thoroughly and it came to conclusions that were generally acceptable to the people of Scotland.<br><br>
To the best of my knowledge, apart from a proposal—which was not accepted—from one honourable Member to rename a constituency so that it included the name of his own, no other significant representations were made. However, the representations of the honourable Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) were acted on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Salmond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister might reflect that some Members of the European Parliament made substantial representations, which the honourable Member for Western Isles did not agree with, effectively to abolish the Highlands and Islands European constituency. The Boundary Commission, in its wisdom, refused to listen to those gerrymandering proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with honourable Gentleman that the Boundary Commission representations were sensible. The fact that it took the representations of the honourable Member for Western Isles into account speaks for the wisdom of its decisions.<br><br>
I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft European Parliamentary Constituencies (Scotland) Order 1996.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at twenty-eight minutes to Five o'clock.</i></p>
