Draft Pneumoconiosis Etc. (Workers' Compensation) (Payment of Claims) Amendment Regulations 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Sir Paul Beresford)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) (Payment of Claims) Amendment Regulations 1996.</p></blockquote>
Before we start, Sir James, I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your honour. A few years ago, I discovered for myself that the moment that one is given a title, everybody shifts the nought at least one place to the right—so I advise you to ignore any comments about pay rises and related matters.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls) signed the original order relating to this matter on 30 March 1988, so we have an expert on the Committee—if my hon. Friend's memory is up to the task.<br><br>
The regulations have been made under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979, and their purpose is to increase by 2.1 per cent.—the rise in the retail price index—the amounts of compensation paid under the Act to persons who first satisfy all the conditions of entitlement on or after 1 August 1996. People suffering from industrial diseases have the right to sue the employer concerned for damages. However, because certain dust-related diseases take a long time to develop and might not be diagnosed until 20 to 40 years or more after exposure, sufferers and their dependants can experience considerable difficulty in claiming compensation. By the time that the disease is diagnosed, the employer or employers responsible may no longer exist. Parliament enacted the 1979 legislation to provide a measure of compensation to persons who cannot claim through the courts in the normal way. It provides lump-sum payments to sufferers from certain industrial diseases or, where the sufferers have died, to their dependants.<br><br>
It was never intended that the 1979 Act should provide an alternative to civil action in the courts. Three basic conditions of entitlement must be satisfied before a payment is made. First, that there is no longer relevant employer who can be sued; secondly, that no court action has been brought nor compensation received in respect of the disease; and, thirdly, that industrial injuries disability benefit has been awarded.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
My Department does all that it can to administer the compensation scheme in a sympathetic way. Although it is necessary to ensure that the conditions for payment are met, it is recognised that each case is an individual disaster and the Department is as generous as the legislation allows. Since the 1979 Act came into force in 1980, more than 8,700 applicants have made a claim, and approximately 70 per cent. have received payment. The total cost to date has been £43.2 million. Payments made under the Act are additional to any industrial injuries disability benefit awarded.<br><br>
The Government have given an undertaking to Parliament to review the amounts payable regularly so as to maintain their value. The draft regulations aim at fulfilling that commitment.<br><br>
I am sure that members of the Committee would agree that the circumstances leading to payments are, to say the least, unfortunate. They reflect the conditions in which some people worked many years ago. All of us recognise that no amount of money will compensate individuals and their families for their loss, but the regulations allow us to give at least some practical and material help. I commend the upgrading of the payment scales to the Committee, and I ask its approval for implementing them.</span></p>
<p>10.34 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Opposition, I give you, Sir James, my best wishes on becoming a knight of the shire. Given that your constituency is urban, that title seems a little incongruous—but I congratulate you anyway.<br><br>
I will ask a question about the Minister's statement before making a more general contribution to the debate. Regulation 2(c) states that
<br><blockquote><p>"in regulation 6(1) (payment where pneumoconiosis is accompanied by tuberculosis), for the amount of £3,575 there shall be substituted the amount of £3,650."</p></blockquote>
However, paragraph 3 of last year's regulations states that
<br><blockquote><p>"the amount of £3,654 shall be substituted for the amount of £3,575 in regulation 6(1) of those Regulations".</p></blockquote>
In other words, the figure in the draft regulations is lower than that announced last year. Perhaps a typographical error occurred this year or last year. I realise that a small sum is involved, but I hoped that the Minister will clarify the matter.<br><br>
Once again, the uprating that the Minister announced today is somewhat mean spirited. The sum on offer is related to the current figure for headline inflation, which is 2.1 per cent. Underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage repayments, is 2.8 per cent. Claimants are likely to be of an older age and not paying a mortgage, and today's uprating is unlikely to maintain their already meagre standard of living.<br><br>
Last year, when inflation was 3.3 per cent., the uprating was 2.2 per cent. The year before that there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0135">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
was no uprating at all. Compensation claimants, who have given up their good health for their work, are already finding it hard to make ends meet. Today's announcement will make their life even more difficult.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Teignbridge introduced the current regulations in 1988. However, the forerunner to them—the Pneumonoconiosis etc. (Workers' Compensation) Act 1979—was introduced by a Labour Government. The Conservative Government have torn away at the Act's proposals, to the extent that there is now no guaranteed annual uprating—and when upratings are awarded, they take account of the headline rate of inflation rather than the underlying rate. The value of the award has been significantly reduced.<br><br>
The award goes hand in hand with, for example, the reduced earnings allowance. People affected by the regulations are also likely to suffer under amendments to the reduced earnings allowance, which came into effect on 24 March. Under the old rules, people were allowed to stay on REA beyond pension age if they were not working because they were unemployed or sick. Under the new rules, their award is permanently replaced by a retirement allowance. The new rule will apply even if people have not retired, and fully intend to find another job or to carry on working.<br><br>
As a result of the change, there is no protection for people who currently receive REA, and who are signing on and are looking for work but are not working because of ill health—unless they are under contract of employment. They will immediately suffer a drop in income of up to £29.70. REA is payable at 25 per cent. of the rate and is worth up to £36.60. The retirement allowance is worth only a maximum of £9.90, and can be as little as 50p a week. In another Committee, the Opposition forced a vote on an amendment to the regime but lost by a single vote. That proposed amendment will be reviewed in the context of social security reforms. The draft regulation that we are considering this morning and those that were passed only a few days ago mean that many people will suffer a substantial loss of income. In some cases, they may lose £30 a week.<br><br>
Despite the penny pinching that I have described, the Government have had to accept in principle a change in the prescription criteria for chronic bronchitis and emphysema for underground coal workers. Earlier this year, my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) initiated a review by the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, which proposed amendments to the prescription criteria for chronic bronchitis and emphysema for underground coal workers. In 1982—much to the Government's credit—those illnesses were added to the prescribed list of diseases for which compensation is available. Since then, many of us have fought to ensure that the qualifying criteria are reviewed. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
for Barnsley, West and Penistone and to others who have given ample evidence to the Government's independent body and to Ministers that the regulations currently mitigate against miners with the prescribed diseases.<br><br>
Professor Harrington, who chaired the 1995 review, said in a letter to the Secretary of State:
<br><blockquote><p>"People have asked whether the forced expiratory volume in one second test, or FEV1 test, is a suitable test, whether the test is carried out properly, and whether it is fair to older and shorter miners."</p></blockquote>
On a separate issue, he added:
<br><blockquote><p>"It has been questioned whether the chest radiograph is an appropriate indicator of dust exposure."</p></blockquote>
In my constituency, of the 584 claims submitted during the first state of the benefit application only 50 applicants were diagnosed as suffering and awarded benefit. I am delighted that the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, having reviewed the regulation, has recommended that the FEV1 test should be retained, but amended to make allowance for underground coal workers with small lung volumes. It also said that the need for evidence on a chest radiograph of dust retention as an index of exposure should be removed from the prescription.<br><br>
In a written answer on 21 May this year, the Under-Secretary of State, Department of Social Security said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We will respond to the council's recommendations once the medical, administrative and financial issues raised by the report have been fully examined."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 21 May 1996; Vol. 278, c. 185.]</p></blockquote>
I understand that the Minister in Committee this morning is a fish out of water—a bit like me. None of us expected to be dealing with the issue but, following the ending of the former Department of Employment, such matters are now to be dealt with by a traditional Minister for Employment or by a Department of Social Security. I do not expect a detailed explanation from the Minister this morning, but I ask for a commitment or explanation from his colleague on when the Government are likely to come forward with proposals to implement the recommendations made by Professor Harrington and his committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did my hon. Friend see the <i>Nottingham Evening</i> Post of 14 June? In an exclusive interview, the Secretary of State for Social Security told the newspaper that the new regulations were to be implemented. If he can tell the <i>Nottingham Evening Post,</i> why cannot he tell Parliament? Will he tell Parliament before the recess?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A copy of that report was sent to me, which is why I raised the issue this morning. There seems to be a difference of opinion between the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary on how the matter is to be dealt with. That is causing confusion and consternation in many mining communities, particularly among people who believe that they are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0136">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
entitled to the benefit and those who have applied previously but now believe that, because of the changes that have taken place, they are likely to succeed on their second application. If provision cannot be made in regulatory form before the House rises for the summer recess, perhaps some timetable of implementation could be provided in written form by the Secretary of State for Social Security.<br><br>
During a debate on the issue on 25 May 1995, I outlined how the timing of the diagnosis could have a crucial effect on the amount of compensation paid under the amended pneumoconiosis regulations before the House at that time. I seek the Committee's indulgence for a short quotation from what I said last year because the Minister has given no suggestion of having moved on since then. I said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Under the amended pneumoconiosis regulations before the House, a 50-year-old who is assessed as 10 per cent. disabled is entitled to £10,888"—</p></blockquote>
that will be uprated by today's regulations to £11,117—
<br><blockquote><p>"as a full and final settlement. If the pneumoconiosis is diagnosed three years on, however, by which time the sufferer may be 50 per cent. disabled—that is a reasonable assumption to make given the cohort of cases about which we already know—his disability would entitle him to £30,006."</p></blockquote>
That is uprated today to £30,636. I added:
<br><blockquote><p>"That is a hypothetical example, but such cases occur all the time.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Entitlement for a disabled person and his or her dependants could vary by as much as £19,118"</p></blockquote>
after today, the variance could be up to £19,519
<br><blockquote><p>"or even more, simply because of the timing of the diagnosis. That is ridiculous and inequitable. Will the Minister bring forward proposals to allow for reassessment when we next discuss the regulations?"—[<i>Official Report,</i> 25 May 1995; Vol. 260, c. 970.]</p></blockquote>
It is clear from what the Minster has said—or not said—this morning that the Government have made no concessions towards a reassessment. Perhaps, when the Minister replies, he will say whether the Government have taken into account the proposals that I put to him last year or whether those proposals were rejected. If they were rejected, will he tell us what he intends to do next year if consideration is given to a reassessment of the huge disparity in compensation depending on when a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis is made? There is a massive disparity—almost £20,000—between an early diagnosis and diagnosis three years on.<br><br>
Those of my hon. Friends who have worked in the asbestos and coal industries know, from their own bitter experience, that it is not unusual for a diagnosis to take anything between two and three years to be approved. In some instances, it is even longer. But, because of the way in which the regulations are framed, the individuals concerned lose out significantly in terms of the compensation that they can obtain. I do not believe that that was the intention
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
of the hon. Member for Teignbridge in 1988. It was not the intention of the House that the regulations should ensure a situation in which a substantial loss of benefit may result from the timing of a diagnosis. For those technical reasons, a non-party political basis, I asked the Government last year to review the situation and to decide whether the regulations should be reassessed and readdressed. I ask the Minister to reconsider that.<br><br>
Finally, I turn to the issue of asbestos. In another guise, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment has responsibility for health and safety. One of the key issues relating to the benefit is that exposure to asbestos is occurring because of inadequate health and safety regulations, which are not being properly enforced. Many of the people who will receive benefit were infected by asbestos several years ago when little information was available in the public domain, either to employers or employees, about the consequences of inhalation of asbestos. That situation has now been rectified and no employer or employee in Britain has any doubt about the consequences of the failure of health and safety regulations for people who have to work with asbestos.<br><br>
However, despite the regulations, there still exists in the UK a substantial trade in asbestos products, which has a combined total value of more than £41 million. Given the continuing need for the regulations because of the continued exposure of people to asbestos, leading to the prescribed diseases, does not the Minister think that we now also need, as a precautionary measure, to reconsider the continuation of this trade and to work out what we can do to reduce or eliminate it over a period?<br><br>
It seems nonsensical that there is common agreement between all parties that the regulations should ensure the payment of benefits to people damaged by asbestos but, at the preventive end, we are still allowing people potentially to be infected by the asbestos trade. There is a need for the House to ensure that we have not more effective means of securing a minimum level of infection for workers in a range of industries, including the construction industry. Therefore, I ask the Minister to come back after the summer recess and provide time in the House for a debate in asbestos and its potentially dangerous effects on a significant number of our citizens.<br><br>
Last year, the Government published a report, through the Health and Safety Commission, which estimated that deaths from this disease will reach an annual rate of 10,000 over the next decade. That is a huge number of deaths from an industrial-related disease. It is, therefore, incumbent on the House that we debate what we can do on an all-party basis to reduce the use of asbestos in circumstances where it can lead to death and injury and to improve our ability significantly to reduce, through asbestos regulations, the number of people who have to handle asbestos-related products.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0137">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
Finally, I asked a parliamentary question in May this year which revealed that there were almost 2,000 cases of cancer of the larynx according to the 1990 figures—the most recent available. I would have preferred a more updated figure, and perhaps the Minister will provide one at a later stage. I was amazed by the answer, which said that the information on possible exposure to asbestos relating to the diagnosis of cancer of the larynx is not being collected by the Department of Health, the Health and Safety Commission or the Department of Social Security. There is a substantial number of cases of cancer of the larynx, the primary cause of which will probably have been asbestos, but no information has been collated on the extent of the range of cancers and whether it has peaked or is on the increase.<br><br>
We need to know what to do to reduce the exposure of asbestos. Asbestosis of the lung is an incurable disease. Asbestosis of the larynx is also incurable, but, unlike asbestosis of the lung, we are not collating any evidence about the spread of the disease and how many people are affected by it. Nor has the Department of Health commissioned research into the link between the use of asbestos and cancer of the larynx, despite the fact that the research of the World Health Organisation, the Canadian Government and others shows a clear link between asbestos-related industrial injuries and cancer of the larynx.<br><br>
There is a sensible approach to that which would be cost effective—it would cost the Government little to provide the up-front resources. We should start the process of ensuring that the Departments of Health and of Social Security, working with the Health and Safety Commission, research and identify the link between cancer of the larynx and asbestosis. They should provide information for use by Ministers on the number of cases of cancer of the larynx which can be related to asbestos exposure. It is nothing more than reasonable that we do that, given that we are doing it already for the disease as it affects other organs, primarily the lungs.<br><br>
I have tried to be positive and to raise serious questions, some of which I hope the Minister will be able to answer this morning—the others he can put in written form to me and other members of the Committee—so that we can move on today and approve the uprating. But in so doing, we should make further improvements for next year on the working of the regulations so that they are beneficial to the recipients of the benefits. The Minister and I would rather not see those benefits being paid because they are a result of quite severe damage caused to people by exposure to asbestos.</span></p>
<p>10.54 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Clapham: <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, West and Penistone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I add my congratulations to those of my colleagues on your elevation, Sir James.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
It is important that we have proper and fair structures to compensate people for loss of faculty, especially those who have worked in industry where the employer has disappeared from the scene. It is also important that we concentrate on preventive ways of dealing with dust-induced environments. The Minister will be aware that, last year, 13 million working days were lost as a result of industrial sickness. That, added to a number of liability claims, cost the insurance industry more than £600 million. That is why, in dealing with dust-induced environments, we should also consider means of prevention. Apart from the slate mining industry and perhaps those few private collieries that have gone out of business—such as those in Wales—the regulations do not apply to the mining industry. However, they are important for people who have worked in industries that have exposed them to asbestos, many of which have gone out of business. My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) pointed out that substantial amounts of asbestos are still used in industry and, in addition, a new industry has developed from the dismantling of the older construction works that used asbestos. There is also a new asbestos management disposal industry. All those factors mean that workers are still coming into contact with asbestos. Many companies that employ workers on the dismantling side do not always provide the necessary occupational health and safety equipment.<br><br>
The definition of asbestosis is covered by that which applies to pneumoconiosis: fibrosis of the lung. The two diseases can often be contracted together, however. The regulations do not refer to such a scenario: for example, a fettler who contracts pneumoconiosis from fettling dust might have previously worked with a machine with asbestos brake linings and, consequently, have a combination of both diseases.<br><br>
The Minister probably knows that the pneumoconiosis compensation scheme that applies to the coal mining industry also covers asbestos, to ensure that both diseases can be taken into consideration. The regulations do not seem to contain a mechanism for considering those diseases together.<br><br>
I recently dealt with a case that, although it relates to mining, provides an example of someone contracting both diseases. An elderly miner, who worked in the 1950s with a machine with asbestos brake linings, developed asbestos particles in his lungs. That resulted in the development of a carcinoma and part of his lungs had to be removed. He did not have asbestosis because for that to be the case there must be fibrosis of the lungs. The additional presence of coal dust, however, meant that when he was diagnosed by the medical appeals tribunal, he was found to have advanced pneumoconiosis. In that case, we were able to link the two diseases to ensure an appropriate payment under the scheme.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield said, the tables do not refer to date of development. I refer

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
the Minister to part A on page 3 of the regulations and offer as an example the case of a man of 70 who, probably as a fettler, came into contact with asbestos and has a 40 per cent. disability assessment, made up of a combination of asbestosis and pneumoconiosis. Under the regulations he would receive £4,190. The date of development may be 40 years earlier. I referred to a miner who had been in contact with a machine having asbestos linings. He worked with that machine in the 1950s before he went into the forces. He did national service in 1955, so he was exposed to asbestos between 1951 and 1955–40 years ago. The only way to deal with the anomaly in the tables is for the Minister seriously to consider applying to the regulations the same rules that apply in the mining industry—that is, date of development.<br><br>
A man of 70 with a 40 per cent. disability would receive £4,190 under the regulations, but if the date of development was 40 years earlier the higher sums at the top of the table would apply. The only fair way of dealing with such cases is to ensure that the date of development is determined by date of diagnosis, which will become the relevant age on which the payment will be based. That would eliminate the enormous anomaly to which my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield referred.<br><br>
When the two diseases are present, the medical appeal tribunal, which already exists, could decide the quantum issue. If the date of development is the point on which payment is based, the tribunal could decide the date of development and, therefore, the quantum. If the Minister would consider making such a change, the procedures for deciding the date of development and relating that to quantum already exist. My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield referred to reduced earnings allowance, which has been replaced by retirement allowance for people who have reached the age of 65, but a 12-month restriction on retrospection has also been introduced. The way in which that works could have a great impact on cases that are brought under the regulations. I gave an example of a 70-yearold man. If he retired at 65, it is likely that he was disabled and unable to follow his regular occupation or one of equal standard for 30 years. Under normal circumstances and before the regulations went through the House on 24 March, a man would have been able to claim reduced earnings allowance for the period for which he was disabled and unable to follow his regular occupation. Since 24 March, that cannot be applied. Under the regulations, cases may be proven, payments may be made and it may be established that a man has been disabled for a large part of his working life—but because of the 12-month restriction he will be unable to claim the reduced earnings allowance for the period for which he was unable to follow an occupation of equal standard to that which he followed before contracting the disease, which will result in a substantial loss.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
I ask the Minister seriously to consider whether in regulations such as it is necessary for an increase to compensate people who have been disabled and are unable to undertake an occupation of equal standard to that which they had before they contracted the disease. That would only be fair in terms of the compensation payable.<br><br>
Similarly, on claims made following death—posthumous claims—I ask the Minister to consider introducing a provision for date of development rather than age of death. That would make an enormous impact, because of the anomalies between the sums of money paid. If someone dies after the age of 70, the post-mortem shows him to be full of asbestos, and the date of development goes as far back as 30 or 40 years, it is only fair that the payment should relate to the disease's date of development. As has been said, the apparatus is already in situ to enable that procedure to be carried out. The medical appeal tribunal could give the date of development, which should be the accepted date from which payments under the scheme are made for posthumous claims.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to take those two major points on board—date of development for a person who is living, and date of development in the event of posthumous claims.</span></p>
<p>11.6 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Elizabeth Peacock <span class='memberconstituency'>(Batley and Spen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister may be aware of the implication of the regulations for constituents of mine who for many years were employed by the British Belting Asbestos Company, which was famous for its Mintex brake linings. I am pleased to say that those old factories have been pulled down, the sites cleared and new factories have been built for a new production line that obviously does not contain the damaging fibres that were previously present.<br><br>
Following the point of the hon. Member for Makerfield, will my hon. Friend say a word on the apparent discrepancies in the figures between what was quoted last year and what is contained in the regulations before us? That will have some impact, and, as my constituencies are very good letters writers, I am quite sure that they will soon be writing to me for an explanation. If my hon. Friend will explain today or let us know later, that will perhaps pre-empt my sending my hon. Friend lots of letters to answer. I hope that he can say that the figures are much improved on last year, not by the small amount that many of us may think.<br><br>
It is right to consider the regulations and to keep uprating them, although many people who claim these benefits receive others as well. This compensation helps to improve their quality of life. They have suffered through no fault of their own and, I believe, through no fault of the company that employed them. It was—accepted at the time that those raw materials could be used and only now, many years later, we are seeing the effects.</span></p>

<p>11.8 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not often caught out and embarrassed, but I am in this case. As at least two pairs of sharp eyes have picked out, there is a mistake in the figures. It must be corrected, and I shall write to all members of the Committee to explain. I am deeply embarrassed, and apologise for the mistake. We are trying to establish which figures are correct and which are wrong. I thank both hon. Members who raised the point, and shall ensure that they have a letter as promptly as possible, so that they can answer any questions. I, too, am aware that people pick up pens very quickly. One problem in my area is that the educational standard is such that not only do my constituents write but read the reply and write back—especially if they think that their Member of Parliament has made a mistake.<br><br>
This has been a constructive and educational debate. As members of the Committee may be aware, I have a personal interest in asbestos. I can remember, as a dental student, licking my fingers and winding the stuff around the inside of casting rings. It makes my skin crawl to think of it, and every cough makes it crawl even more.<br><br>
I can answer some points, but not others. The hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone made a point about equipment not being worn or supplied. My experience, from what I have seen of workers, has been that equipment is supplied and not worn. Unfortunately, some people seem to have a macho tendency not to wear the equipment. I have seen workers putting the equipment on when they knew the boss was coming and taking it off when he went away. That is incredible and ludicrous to anyone with an understanding of the issue. The only constructive suggestion on the matter has been the HSE suggestion that we should send all the relevant information not only to workers and employers, but to spouses. They are the people who will have to live with the problem later. I understand that in France a back-up organisation of spouses supports many of the unions in matters of health and safety. Their enforcement is greater than anything that the HSE, or the unions of employers can do.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone made three other points, two of which concerned the date of development. I shall consider those and write to the hon. Gentleman. He also mentioned dealing with the two relevant diseases together. Perhaps I may bring in at this point some of the comments of the hon. Member for Makerfield. As he pointed out, the regulations have "social security" printed at the top, so it is rather intriguing that an Environment Minister is speaking to the item.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not doing so badly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you very much. It is a real honour.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
We shall have to send the relevant copy of <i>Hansard</i> to the appropriate Ministers, so that they can consider certain points. Obviously I am not au fait with the details of DSS procedures and payments although the outline was interesting and I shall certainly read the relevant points again.<br><br>
I was intrigued by the point that was made about cancer of the larynx. I am surprised that the figures cannot be obtained from medical research rather than from the DSS because much research has been done on carcinoma of the larynx, particularly in relation to tobacco and, more recently, marijuana, which seems to be making a considerable difference to the figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the problems is structural, rather than a political or intellectual desire not to proceed. As I understand the matter, no note has been sent by the Department to the consultants or others who work in the relevant field about providing details of the primary cause in cases of cancer of the larynx. No decisions have been made on that matter—something that has come to light only because of my parliamentary question. It may be worth while if the Minister will speak to his colleagues at the Department of Health about arrangements, when a diagnosis of cancer of the larynx is made, to show the cause—if that is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly pass on that recommendation. I have an interest in the matter, arising from my hobby, shall we say, which used to be my profession. Looking for carcinomas is part of my professional duty when business allows.<br><br>
The subject of asbestos use, and its banning, was raised. I understand that any further prohibitions would have to be based on agreements in the European Union. I think that all members of the Committee are aware that efforts are being made to find suitable alternatives. Such alternatives have been found for use in my profession. That research must and will continue. The HSE constantly reviews the uses of asbestos and, as all Committee members know, is pushing health and safety with respect to asbestos as hard as it can. A big campaign recently started.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the alternative and asbestos removal, around December 1992 the HSE made a proposal to the Government—which was readily accepted at the time—for a formal assessment of the problems of high-temperature asbestos removal. I understand that the report was agreed by the Department and the Health and Safety Commission in October 1995, but information about the method of assessment used to secure the best way forward for those companies that have to remove asbestos has not yet been published. Will the Minister prompt his colleagues in the Health and Safety Commission to publish the rest of the information, so that we can see whether there is a need for further examination of the method of high-temperature asbestos removal.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
Sir Paul Beresford: Unfortunately, this Committee has increased my interest in the matter, so I want to pursue the hon. Gentleman's point for my own reasons. I shall respond to him in due course.<br><br>
Questions were raised about the RPI. The RPI is the standard method used—it has always been used by the DSS, for example—and it was established as the means of review in the original legislation. Although I understand the question, the hon. Gentleman will recognise that the draft regulations follow the same pattern and I think that we should keep to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hinchcliffe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wakefield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister advise the Committee on the Government's stance on entitlement to benefit under the draft regulations in cases where there is a contest in law over an employer's liability? The Minister made it clear that the current criteria include the condition that no relevant employer can be sued. I am conscious, as are other Yorkshire Members of Parliament, of developments in Armleigh in Leeds relating to the Turner Newall case. Have the Government examined the matter in the light of on-going court actions, especially those in which a judgment has been reached and an appeal lodged?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are using the original primary legislation. I repeat, the legislation specifically lays down three basic conditions of entitlement, which include the conditions that no relevant employer can be sued and that no court action has been brought nor compensation received in respect of the disease. Even though we are sympathetic to the problem, the primary legislation inhibits us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The situation is slightly more complicated than my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchcliffe) suggests. In a case where there is an identifiable employer and agreement is reached on the level of compensation, the compensation recovery unit kicks in. Last year, for example, more than £1 million of compensation paid by private sector employers through insurers was withdrawn from sufferers of disease. The only bodies to make a net gain were the insurance companies involved.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
Concern has been widely expressed about the operation of the regulations in respect of the compensation recovery unit. The result is that the state pays out maximum benefits. Because there is to be a recovery by the compensation recovery unit, the employer has an incentive not to make a major award, so the individual loses out—in some cases by up to £40,000 to £50,000. All the individual receives is the basic state entitlements. That is a major flaw in the operation of the regulations and the compensation recovery unit. As the Minister's interest has been enlivened by this debate, perhaps he will ask his colleagues to consider that matter. Why are large amounts of money that have been paid out by private sector employers who accept liability immediately withdrawn through the compensation recovery unity?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will do as suggested and, as I said earlier, I shall ensure that the DSS receives a copy. The debate has gone fractionally beyond the range of the draft regulations and, much as I would like to comment, I am sure that screams would be heard from other quarters if I did.<br><br>
We all agree on the importance of the 1979 Act. We all agree that the regulations need upgrading. I hope that we all agree that no amount of money can compensate for the misery and suffering caused by diseases such as those that we have discussed today. We are making progress: there have been improvements in health and safety standards and the increase in the understanding of the problem by employers and work forces is also continuing apace. Hopefully, the incidence of some of these ghastly diseases will diminish and, in time, disappear. My Department gives every assistance to all those who apply for payments, and it will continue to administer the scheme as sympathetically as the legislation allows. I should be surprised were the Committee not to approve the draft regulations.</span></p>
