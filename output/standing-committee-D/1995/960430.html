	<div class='legislation'>National Health Service (Optical Charges and Payments) Amendment Regulations 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the National Health Service (Optical Charges and Payments) Amendment Regulations 1996 (S.I., No. 582).</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the National Health Service (Charges for Drugs and Appliances) Amendment Regulations 1996.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to discuss both orders, but in particular the order dealing with charges for drugs and appliances. The Minister nods sagely. I am sure that he understands why we want to discuss the matter. In 1975—indeed, on 1 April 1971—prescription charges stood at 20p. Today we are seeking the approval of the House to increase them to £5.50.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a reasonable world, it could be argued that increases in line with inflation are acceptable. But it is obvious, given the hikes in precription charges in the past 17 years, that the Government have not sought to increase charges in line with inflation. In only two years—1988 and 1989—was the increase inflation-linked. Most of the increases have been savage and we cannot escape the conclusion that this is a Government-inspired tax on health. We have said it before, but it is worth repeating, that the Government have systematically and deliberately hiked up prescription charges in the past 17 years. They have gone much further than increasing charges in line with inflation; they have imposed an additional burden on people who require drugs to treat illness and disease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have taken such action in a number of areas. They do so unashamedly, so none of us should be surprised that they want to hike up hidden costs and pass them on to patients who seek improvements in their health. They pretend to be a prudent Government who do not want to impose any additional tax burdens on the public. It will be interesting to know from the Minister what cumulative charge has been imposed on patients in the past 17 years. What portion of that was inflation-linked and what portion was the difference between the charge and the inflation element? I think that the figures will be shocking. The Government have imposed that burden by stealth year in and year out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
In the early I 980s—after the massive 125 per cent. increase on 16 July 1979—the Government said that they would increase prescription charges in line not with inflation but with costs. The Minister will claim in his defence that the increases reflect the much higher costs faced by the health service. But such increases are unacceptable. In 1979. the increase was 125 per cent., in 1980 the increases were 56 per cent. and 43 per cent., in 1983 it was 30 per cent., and so it goes on. How do the Government justify putting a massive burden on sick people? That is a key question for the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's debate has become ritualistic. We consider these issues every year, either in Committee or on the Floor of the House. The Government should justify their actions. In the next 12 months they should explain to the public what they are doing about this tax on sickness. What evaluation have they made of it? They seem to hike up charges as if they were in a vacuum, with no regard to the implications. What have been the implications of vouchers for eye tests and—although we are not dealing specifically with these—of dental and prescription charges? What effect have those so-called marginal increases had? I hope that the Minister will tell us that the Department of Health has undertaken detailed studies that show what the implications have been, but I suspect that there have been no such studies or, if there have been, that they have not been published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government want to impose increased taxes. they must spell out the consequences to patients and to the public. Several concerns have been expressed in the press and in medical journals about what is happening to prescription charges. One of the key arguments is that the group of people who are not exempt but who are on low wages cannot afford some of the increases that the Government describe as marginal but which could be described as punitive for people on low incomes. What fact-finding exercise has the Department of Health done so that it can advise Ministers on the implications of hiking up their tax on health? Ministers may not want any objective valuation of what they are doing, but it is a valid question to ask.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Government tend to turn a blind eye to the predicament that doctors face when they have to give patients three prescriptions. for example. at a cost of £16.50, knowing that they might not he taken up because patients cannot afford them. What information does the Department of Health have on that? What is the Minister's advice and guidance on the implications for health of those charges? They are astonishing, and yet the Government preach prudence in matters of finance and taxation and say that they always do the right thing by the public. If that is the case, let us have a justification for some of the increases instead of the blind assertion that they provide valuable income to the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly. are people deterred from visiting their general practitioner by the high cost of drugs? That is another important consideration. I shall he objective. and ask whether there is a link between access and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
charges. The Department of Health must have carried out a number of studies on that over the past 17 years. Cabinets must be full to the brim with objective evaluations of Tory tax hikes on health. I hope that the Minister will tell us about them this afternoon, or at least put them in the Library for us to read.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, people who suffer from certain chronic conditions are exempt from charges, yet others with different chronic conditions are not. What studies are being done on the fairness of that? It is obvious that certain people with similar—at least from their own perception—conditions are given different treatments in terms of charges. That cannot be right. The Government must have an idea of the problems that they are creating and what they should do about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fifth point concerns optical charges. The regulations will increase the value of the vouchers for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark and Bermondsey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the points that the hon. Gentleman has made, but we are a year on since the last debate on this issue, when the right hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) said that the Labour party was holding a review. Opposition parties have an obligation to say what they would do, and it would be helpful for us and for people outside the House to know what Labour party policy is on prescription charges—which it would freeze, which it would reduce and which it would increase. The hon. Gentleman should tell us before he completes his remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is aware of the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South in the debate last year. She made the point that what is required is a thorough review of the charges. If one reads carefully what was said, the implication—it was more than an implication—was that we would be and were considering the issue. Of course, in Government, we will want to tackle the issues that I have described. If the hon. Gentleman listens carefully, I am setting out an agenda of the types of issue that a new Labour Government will tackle—issues that the Conservative Government have tried to ignore time and again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fifth point deals with the health implications of optical charges. There is an inconsistency. Older people are exempt from prescription charges, but not optical charges. How many cases of eye cancer are we missing? What information do the Government have on file? [	<i>Interruption</i>.] The Minister mumbles under his breath, but these are important and serious health matters because everyone, except for the Ministers in the Department of Health, knows that one of the best ways to pick up key diseases among older people is through the eye examination. But the Government have failed to address that key point, which any caring and sensible Government would want to address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department has nothing to say about the issues. We need to examine the whole question of preventive
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
health care and the implications of the massive increases in charges because prevention is better than cure for front-line patient care. Is that an adage to which the Government still subscribe? It would not appear so from their actions on charges. A serious issue surrounds the health of the nation and preventive health care. How can the Department of Health and its Ministers justify what appears to be an arbitrary hiking up? Perhaps it is Treasury inspired—let us be charitable about the matter and not put all the blame on the Department of Health and the ministerial team. There seems to be an inconsistency in the level of the hike. One thing is clear: the sustained increase is not in doubt and the Government should start to discuss how charges link not only to the quality of care but to access to it. They should take our advice and conduct a review of all the implications of the charges that they have imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I finish my initial comments, I want to deal with the tax burden that has been placed on the public and on patients during the past 17 years—[	<i>Interruption</i>.] The Minister is obviously working out the answers to some of my questions, but perhaps he could listen to this point for a few minutes. I understand that his boredom threshold might be a little low.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mr. Gerald Malone)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very excited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the excitement that has obviously gripped the Minister, but at the end of the day, this contemptuous dismissal of the implications of charges on health is quite unacceptable. We are used to longevity. There are many people on the Government Benches who deserve—and are perhaps looking forward to—a long holiday. What are the implications for patient health in relation to charges? I want to finish on that point. The Minister cannot get off with the usual waffle that the increases are in line with costs, that 80 per cent. of people are exempt and that the prescription charge is only a proportion of the price of the drugs received. That is the well-rehearsed, insensitive and uncaring response that we are all used to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Stephen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Shoreham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was disappointed by the hon. Gentleman's contemptuous dismissal of the relevant questions posed by the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes). In the unlikely event that the Labour party becomes the next Government, would it abolish optical charges for older people and, if the money is not to be raked for the national health service in the manner proposed by the regulations, how would it be raised by a future Labour Government? Does the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) have the shadow Chancellor's authority to pledge increases in taxation for the purpose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it quite clear that we are committed to a review of the charges based on the sensible and sane arguments that we have put forward. That is not a view held only by Labour: it is the view
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0083">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
of the Select Committee on Health and of the British Medical Association. We are not alone in seeking to bring sanity to bear on charges that are increased at the whim of Ministers and the Treasury, allegedly to contribute more money to the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is crucial that the issues that we have raised are taken into account. Not everyone can get it wrong and the Government do not listen. Let us have a cogent reply from the Minister to our specific questions. Unless we do, the proposals will be seen for what they are—yet another attempt to pass the Tory tax burden on to people who are sick or diseased. We have put forward a series of propositions that must be considered carefully to ensure that we do not deter people from having access to prescriptions and that we do not irreparably damage people's health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Pickles 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for missing the earlier part of the hon. Gentleman's speech but I found the last part very interesting. The hon. Gentleman has been straightforward in telling us about the review. Unless I misunderstand him the review is about whether the level of charges will act as a deterrent. It is implicit in the review that it will recommend either abolition of the charges, increasing the charges at a slower rate or reducing them. Those are reasonable questions. The Committee would like to know whether the hon. Gentleman can give a commitment, if the charges are to be reduced, that money will be raised to meet any shortfall in income. That is not an unreasonable question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To quote the old adage, the old ones are the best. It is now clear that there is growing anticipation on the Government Benches of the prospect of a Labour victory. We have already had the Liberal Democrats characteristically asking us that question; and we have now had two interventions from the Government Benches on the same topic. It is abundantly clear that they all anticipate a Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case the hon. Gentleman missed what I said first time let me say again that we are committed to a review, which should build upon the work of the Select Committee, the BMA and a whole host of independent organisations that recognise the absurdities and anomalies of the present system. That is a sensible way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Generous as I am, I am unwilling to let the hon. Gentleman back in if it is on the same point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is on a—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not given way yet. I suspect that my generosity would lead to the same question being posed in another way. I have already answered
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
the question three times and there is a limit to how much the Chair or others would want to hear me answer it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I finish by asking the Minister to escape from the pathetic brief that is always given out in response to our key concerns. Let him address the real issues. If he does, we can at last have a proper debate on charges and the wider absurdities and irregularities that we have pinpointed this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.48 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark and Bermondsey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important debate. The Labour party was right to pray against the regulations so that there could be a debate. Last year there was a debate on the Floor of the House late one evening. It merits being regarded as a ritual annual debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in my intervention, we all have a duty to say what we will do and how we will finance it. I have to tell the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) that Labour cannot go on ducking every single question about economics. The electorate will decide whether they win the next election, and the Labour party has a duty to tell the electorate the truth. It is not good enough to say that there should be a review. That is exactly what Labour said last year. It should carry out a review and come to some conclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yes, the Select Committee on Health recommended a review, but that was before the debate last March, Yes, the BMA said the same thing, but it is a lobby group representing professional interests. We are the politicians: it is for us to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two options. Either the Labour party should carry out the review and publish its conclusions—the principles or criteria will not change if it wins the election—or it should say that all-party agreement is needed on this subject. I predict that, in our lifetime, Governments of any colour will he forced to have prescription charges. The question is not whether we have them, but how much they should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hugh Bayley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(York)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tenor of the hon. Gentleman's remarks makes me wonder whether he has read the Select Committee's report. That Committee has a majority of Conservative Members. and it made the case for reducing certain prescription charges. It believed that such a reduction could he contained within the existing spend. The Committee did not want to advocate an additional spending burden on the Government. The hon. Gentleman's suggestion that a reduction in charges must lead to an increase in taxation simply does not hold up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right, but he and his colleagues should offer a solution to that problem. He took part in the debate last year and said that there ought to be a review. I agree: we need to review the question and decide whether we have the right categories for exemption. The hon. Gentleman knows as well as I that the vast majority of people are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
exempt from prescription charges and that only a minority of people are charged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are controversial issues. All hon. Members' constituents who have to pay prescription charges are troubled by them and by the amount that they have gone up under a Tory Government. I also agree that the addition of costs for certain charges does not mean that the overall burden—either as part of the health budget or the national Budget—goes up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we must have answers to specific questions. It is no good for Labour Members appearing on election platforms and radio programmes to say, when asked about prescription charges—or higher education funding, or other policies—that they will hold a review. People must be elected on mandates, not on the promise of a review. Labour Members can try to get re-elected on the thinnest manifesto written since the last world war, but it is not good enough, and not straightforward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrat position on these charges has not changed since last year. Our policy remains explicit, but that does not mean that I—who inherited this brief last November—will not ensure that that policy remains satisfactory when the time comes to write our manifesto. So I do not undertake not to change our policy before the next election. At present, our policy is that prescription charges for the minority of people who pay them ought to be frozen at the level at which they stood at the last general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is our present manifesto policy, and there is a spending commitment that exempt categories would remain the same. It may be that we ought to study which categories should be moved in and out of exemption, but we are clear that the money should come from a tax on tobacco. Increasingly, the public—who in general do not like taxes being raised—are more in favour of paying taxes when they know what the money is being used for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if people knew that 5p from every packet of 20 cigarettes sold was going towards freezing prescription charges and keeping eye and dental checks free, they would understand that that was a good way of spending the revenue. Last year, the Government raised cigarette taxes. That money should have been transferred across and linked directly to health provision. Smoking is bad for you; it kills 100,000 people each year. Tobacco advertising promotes smoking and the Government have always been supportive of the tobacco industry. They should take some money off people who buy those extremely harmful products and put it into the health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that his party would increase the taxes on tobacco? If not, how would his party pay for the other things that are currently paid for out of that tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Gentleman's party, my party and other parties review all the public expenditure commitments annually so that we can take part in the annual debate in the autumn. Our position last year was that we would increase tobacco
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
tax by 5p in the pound and that all that money would be put into the NHS budget. I can give the hon. Gentleman the costings, which were accurately worked out. They would allow the freezing of prescription charges, which is why I make the point now, and the restoration of free optical and dental checks, which we believe are important preventive health care measures. The Government, to be fair, put up tobacco taxes by more than 5p on a packet of 20; that money has gone into the general kitty, so that it has already been accounted for this year. We will therefore have to decide whether a further 5p on a packet of 20 would be required and, as the hon. Gentleman would expect, we will announce our decision in the autumn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In short, the hon. Gentleman's question was perfectly proper and the answer is that we think the money should come from tax on cigarettes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Stern 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the hon. Gentleman back to his comment that our predicated taxes are more acceptable? I am sure that, like me, he has received many postcards and letters from smokers, strongly expressing their opposition to futher increases in tobacco taxation. I am not asking the hon. Gentleman to say whether he agrees or disagrees with such correspondence, but does he agree that it is the easiest thing in the world for a politician to propose a tax increase that does not affect him personally? I presume that the hon. Gentleman does not smoke. Would not it be more honest for him to say that that tax increase, like any tax increase, is acceptable only to those who do not have to pay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To take the last point first, tax increases are, to be fair, more acceptable to those who do not have to pay them, although some people understand that money has to be raised and that they have to make a contribution. I know that the hon. Gentleman has a more direct interest in the tobacco industry because his constituency—Bristol—has an established tobacco industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not any more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bristol and W. D. and H. 0. Wills are associated in my mind as a historical partnership, but if Wills is not there now, that is no longer accurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the hon. Gentleman is that I received some cards and letters on that subject. from newsagents and smokers, and I replied to every one frankly, saying that I disagreed with them and that I believed tobacco duty had to go up. 1 can give the figures—the Minister will correct me if I am wildly out. The freezing of prescription charges would cost £5 million extra per year and 5p extra on cigarettes saves roughly £200 million a year. Much of the money raised from that tax would therefore he available for other things. after prescription charges had been frozen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will know that the National Asthma Campaign has recently sought to persuade Ministers that one of the most inequitable things about present
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
prescription charges is that people who have a block booking of prescriptions for the year, to which the hon. Member for Fife, Central referred, may find it difficult to pay upfront. Has the Minister had a chance to reflect on the reasonable proposal that has been put, principally by the National Asthma Campaign, that payment by instalments, spread out over a year, should be available to everyone and that no one should have to pay upfront for the reduced costs of paying in a block? I have heard people speaking from experience about how that prevents them having the medicines they need. That would seem to be a helpful variation of the present payments system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have three points to make about optical charges and payments. First, there is an anomaly in that the categories of people exempt from prescription charges are not the same as the categories of people who are exempt from paying for—or who receive vouchers for—optical appliances such as glasses, lenses and so on. If we are to have a review we need to be sure that the right category of people is exempt from payment for the set of commodities—drugs, for example—that they need for their health. We also need to be sure that the right category of people is given vouchers to help with the cost of eye appliances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People are categorised as exempt because they are pensioners, or under 18, or on income support, or—in relation to optical charges—because they are deemed to be on low incomes because they receive family credit. It would be useful to ensure that the same tests applied in all cases. Will the Minister say why the same criteria are not used for the two sets of regulations? That would be a valid approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is that this year's I per cent. rise in charges will not keep pace with the costs incurred, and I have received representations on that point from the Association of Optometrists. Coincidentally, the Institute of Optometry is based in my constituency. I saw its stall the other day at a local exhibition. The sign said an all-day eye test was on offer, but the price seemed to require some thinking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any case, the association made the point that the voucher amounts are not keeping pace with the costs involved in the tests. So a person who wants to pay for new glasses only with a voucher will have to shop around a lot to find somewhere that will provide an appliance at the cost of the voucher alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to a survey carried out at Christmas last year among a random sample of registered optometrists and dispensing opticians,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the prevailing prices were well above the values of the lowest bands. namely £42.07 (compared to £26.70 for Band A) and £66.53 (compared to £46.00 for Band E)</p></blockquote>
The association said
	<br><blockquote><p>"These results indicate that voucher values are inadequate. The consequence is that many people are having to 'shop around' for glasses. as more and more outlets are unable to supply at or below voucher values. These people tend to he the more vulnerable in society."</p></blockquote>
It is tokenistic to put the cost of the voucher up by 1 per cent. if the real cost of the appliance is rising by
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
more than that. The cost of the voucher is falling further and further behind. We need to be honest about it: people should either get a voucher that can be exchanged for a free appliance, or they should know that a voucher only meets, say, half the cost of an appliance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ought to be troubled by the decision—taken during this Government's Administration—to abolish free eye tests. That was a bad mistake, and it was passed only after a very close vote in the House of Commons. Some Conservative Back Benchers were vociferous in their opposition to the Government's imposition of dental and eye check charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister seriously consider reinstating free eye tests and free dental checks before the next general election? Su ch a move would not be onerous for the taxpayer. It would be very helpful in terms of preventive health care, and would allow people to have their eyes and teeth checked regularly. The imposition of charges has reduced considerably the number of checks that are carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will oppose the additional cost proposed in the order today. Although the voucher's value is being increased, the increase does not keep pace with the effect of inflation on the cost of the goods for which it is meant to help people pay. First we abolished the free test, then we started charging people more for appliances. They have become more and more out of pocket. The vulnerable will suffer, which is a disadvantage of the measure and goes against the spirit of the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can answer my specific questions. I also hope that my colleagues and I have made our position on the two matters clear. We all have a duty to be as clear as possible for those who want us to come clean with our policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mr. Gerald Malone)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to the speeches of the hon. Members for Fife, Central and for Southwark and Bermondsey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey put his finger on it when he wondered when the Labour party's review would conclude. I remind members of the Committee that the Government's policy of taking cash from people who require prescribed drugs and using it for health care in the national health service has been going on for slightly longer than a year. In fact. the hon. Member for Fife, Central and his party have had some 17 years in which to conduct their review, yet they have made no pledges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was, however, interested to note that a principle appears to have been agreed—that charges will stay in some form. I noted carefully that the hon. Gentleman made much of the fact that this year's increases were in excess of inflation. That was his principal point. I am sure that members of the Committee will have understood the implication. He said that it would have been fairer—if I misquote him, I will give him an opportunity to correct me in a second—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helen Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should bear in mind the fact that under the Government charges have risen over inflation every single year during the past 17 years. We are not talking about just one year, but every single year for the past 17 years. The Minister is obviously proud of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady does not illuminate the Committee's proceedings by stating the blindingly obvious. It has always been the case that the Government have levied affordable charges on the public and devoted the proceeds to health care expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central again failed to set out how that exenditure would be replaced. It buys a significant amount of health care for the public. The public will be interested to know—because the hon. Gentleman has failed to tell us—whether, if he were in charge of health policies, some £310 million would drop out of health care expenditure or whether it would have to be raised by taxation. Its loss would mean that the public would lose 75,000 hip operations, 99,000 new pacemakers or 235,000 cataract operations. I make no apology for giving the Committee those figures. They are the sort of statistics that the general public can understand. If the hon. Gentleman objects to the charges, he owes the Committee and the public an explanation of what he would do instead. If he would not replace the expenditure, he must face up to the implications of what would be lost. He has done neither.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's remark that prevention is better than cure. As far as the health service is concerned, I believe that. It is also an adage that some fashionable commentators might bear in mind when they suggest that a Labour Government might be good for the health service or for the country as a whole. Prevention is certainly better than cure as far as that is concerned. We have heard nothing positive from the hon. Member for Fife, Central about what he would do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me set out, for the Committee's benefit, the reasons why the Government support this policy and have developed it over the years. It has been designed to provide good value for those who pay and we have made sure that those who cannot afford it are exempt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman produced the same old chestnut. He always sings ancient hymns from the
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
same old hymn sheet, never modern songs. We are having the same debate as we have had before, and it is clear that the Labour party has learnt nothing. because it simply proceeds by assertion. The hon. Member for Fife, Central was at it again: he anticipated a speech that I was not going to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to support the policy in some detail. NHS charges provide good value for money for those who pay them. We estimate that the average total cost of a dispensed item in 1996-97 will be £9.30. There is a public debate about whether the charges represent good value for money or whether it would be better for the real price of drugs to be charged. Opposition Members have asked why people should pay £5.50 when the real cost of the drug is less. The answer is perfectly simple—it is a flat charge for drugs that often cost significantly more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give the Committee two examples of why the charges are such good value. The net cost of Losec, which is an ulcer healing drug, is £35 for a 14-capsule pack. A preventive inhaler for chronic asthma costs more than £23 for a standard 200-dose unit. More than 50 per cent. of dispensed items paid for at the pharmacist's counter cost more than the prescription charge of £5.50. So the public get a good deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What proportion of items dispensed costs less than the £5.50 charge that the Government seek to introduce?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More than 50 per cent. will cost more, so fewer than 50 per cent. will cost less—I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an exact figure off the top of my head. I would be pleased to do so. although I think that I have answered his point in parliamentary answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled by the Minister's answer, because the evidence given by the Department of Health to the Select Committee on Health suggested that more than 50 per cent. of items cost more than £4.75, which was the prescription charge at the time of the Select Committee's inquiry two years ago. It seems implausible, given that prescription prices have been frozen under the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme, that a majority of items now cost more than £5.50.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 1 am happy to examine the figures in detail again, but I can give the hon. Gentleman a simple explanation. Under the PPRS, when new drugs are introduced—as they are all the time and have been during the past two years—drug companies can charge whatever market price they want. It may be that even though the figure to which the hon. Gentleman referred was given two years ago. it is still the same now, two years on. The price of certain items on the drug bill either will not have increased or the increase will have been minimal. That is not a difficult point. but as it is of concern to the hon. Gentleman I shall reconsider the matter and write to him in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
My point to the Committee is that we provide good value for money. Let us consider whether we protect those people who need protecting. The hon. Gentleman said that some people who need drugs are not actually getting them. As Minister for Health, I and the rest of the Department have that as a prime concern. Our whole policy is based on the fact that those who cannot afford drugs will get exemption or will be helped through the season ticket holding scheme. To provide some illustration to the hon. Gentleman, we expect about 85 per cent. of prescription items to be dispensed free of charge to patients. If the hon. Gentleman's memory serves him extremely well, he might recall that when prescription charges were reintroduced in 1968, the figure was only 42 per cent. As we have moved to a flat-rate standard charge which has been raised to secure the funds for health care, we have also seriously taken into account those who cannot afford to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The move from 42 per cent. to 85 per cent. is extremely significant, but that is not all. A further 5 per cent. of all items will go to season ticket holders who last year recouped the cost of their tickets about three times over. Season tickets offer excellent value for money for those who need regular or frequent medication. We extended the already generous exemption arrangements on 1 April 1988 to include all students under 19 and last April we extended them to include people receiving disability working allowance and their partners. From 20 October last year, following the Richardson case, we extended the provisions even further to include all men over 60. In the constant debate, I hope that the Committee will understand that one of the Government's prime purposes is to ensure that those who cannot afford drugs receive them and fall within an exemption or are helped with the purchase of drugs through the season ticket scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey asked about representations made by the National Asthma Campaign. We examined the issue carefully. The worry was about how the scheme might operate in practice—there is always a practical danger if only one payment is made of what the pharmacist would do faced with someone requiring a drug for which payments had not been kept up to date. I reached the conclusion that if a national scheme were to be put in place, pharmacists and their patients could be placed in great difficulty, although we understand the point that was made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to be able to confirm two things to the hon. Gentleman, of which he might be aware. It gives me pleasure to be able to reaffirm those things to the Committee: first, we are giving pharmacists a power to sell pre-payment certificates. They can do that on their own terms. That gets round the problem that I described to the Committee because the pharmacist and the patient will have a close relationship: each will probably understand the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
other and, under the circumstances, it is more likely that any obligation entered into between the patient and the pharmacist will be upheld than if the patient simply had a right under a national scheme. Secondly, I am aware that such a system has occasionally operated across the country. If a practice not entirely within the regulations can be identified as better practice, it is my instinct to change the regulations so that the practice can be made more widely available. I know that campaigners welcome that idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also agreed to increase publicity so that public awareness of pre-payment certificates can be raised. That is important. The National Asthma Campaign told us that awareness was a problem and we responded positively; the campaign welcomed that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To continue with the question of exemptions, it is important that the Committee recognises that our prescription charge exemption arrangements are probably among the most generous in Europe. No child, student under 19, pregnant woman, woman with a child under one or person over 60 or on a low income has to pay; as has been pointed out to the Committee, people with certain medical conditions receive their medication free as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are always examining ways of making services even better for patients. I explained to the Committee about the pre-payment certificates that we have developed and we have also made some changes to the NHS low-income scheme which I should like to put on the record today. From 18 March the majority of over-60 or disabled people started to receive 12-month certificates of health under the NHS low income scheme. The majority of students will receive certificates for the whole academic year. Nearly 80 per cent. of those who currently claim now need to do so only once instead of twice a year. That is a great convenience: it cuts down on bureaucracy and helps those who wish to benefit from the scheme. In support of the scheme we produced new patient literature on all NHS-charged services, setting out clearly the help to which patients are entitled. It is being sent out to all doctors, dentists, pharmacists, opticians and hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to spectacle vouchers. The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey asked whether we could consider hypothecation in the context of eyesight tests. Hypothecation is all very well so long as one realises that the money has probably been spent elsewhere. However, following the intervention of my hon. Friend. the Member for Shoreham, the hon. Gentleman was not clear about whether he meant extra taxation over and above the substantial amount that is raised by the Government from tobacco taxation, which goes hack into general tax expenditure. It was not clear whether he was. pledging the Liberal Democrats to an extra 5p over and above all that, or identifying the 5p as a proportion of what is already charged. In the latter case. as my hon. Friend rightly pointed out. no extra tax is raised at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0088">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was very clear and I will be so again. Our proposal was made during last year's Budget. We said that tax on a packet of 20 cigarettes should be raised by 5p and that all of it should help to fund the health service. I enumerated precisely in what areas. In fact, the Government raised tax on tobacco by more than 5p and it has gone into the general kitty. If we want to hypothecate, we would have to propose further taxation. Our proposal was that 5p of the total cost of a packet of 20 would be passed on the the health service so that people understood that they were making a contribution. I accept that it is now spent and that the issue will have to be addressed again this November.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give the hon. Gentleman the credit for at least being clear about the increased burdens of taxation that his party is prepared to impose on the electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Fife, Central and for Southwark and Bermondsey both asked about health risk implications. The hon. Member for Fife, Central assumed that our policy had resulted in greater health risks. The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey also alluded to that in the context of eyesight tests. I suggest that the Committee considers the best evidence that is available about the number of eyesight tests conducted throughout the population since charges were introduced and free tests were abolished. The truth is that they have risen slightly and certainly not decreased to a large extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appropriate figure is the average of the number of sight tests conducted between 1985 and 1988–12 million a year. That provides a reasonable base. The latest figures suggest that that has increased to 12.7 million a year. Thus available evidence does not show that there has been a regression. Most of the conditions that were referred to by the two hon. Gentlemen can be detected by eyesight tests. Of course, I look carefully at the figures, but I am reassured by the total number. I do not believe the unsupported assertion of Opposition Members that our policies have created a great health risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to bandy statistics. I know that there are caveats with regard to statistics, but can the Minister give the Committee the figure of the number of eye tests for the year before their abolition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason that I gave the figure as an average is that it is fairer, because the year before abolition was unusual; more people took eyesight tests in anticipation of that abolition. However, if the number of tests is looked at over time, one sees a fairly flat figure which increases dramatically when it is known that there will be no more free tests and which then falls but begins to rise again. That is why I gave the Committee the fairest and most commonsense figure of an average 12 million, which has now risen to 12.7 million. I do not want to he pernickety about the precise number of thousands involved, but I want to
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
illustrate to the Committee that. on the best evidence we have, there has not been a structural fall in the number and we are now beginning to see a rise in the way that I would expect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be a valid statistical base, but can the Minister put on record the figure for the 12 months before the test was abolished?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I am able to do that now but I shall certainly write to the hon. Gentleman. From recollection, I have already given that figure during debates on the Floor of the House but I shall happily give it again to the hon. Gentleman whom I know takes a keen interest in that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, Central asked me to respond to the question about vouchers. I would like to. make two points about that and to explain why the increase in the value of the voucher was less this year than might have been expected. There is a simple reason for that; this year, we took into account a recent decision that VAT no longer has to be paid on the full cost of spectacles. It is reasonable for members of the Committee to expect that when we increased voucher values after VAT was first applied to dispensing spectacles, that was accompanied by a corollary—although I am not sure that Opposition Members entirely accept corollaries—that when VAT was removed and the extra money was no longer required, we should review the position. I take the point which was fairly made by the hon. Member for Fife, Central, about the effect that that has: does it mean that people are able to get spectacles for the value of the voucher? I too have listened to what the profession said on the matter and realise that while the profession has a case to put, which it puts in its own way, it may be parti prix when it comes to seeking the maximum amount of the value. My test is whether people are able to use the vouchers to get spectacles. The Department's surveys show that half of all vouchers are redeemed with an optician who has supplied spectacles within voucher values. That is a significant point which answers the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition make much of such discussions every year. I am happy that they do so and that they question the Government policy of raising £310 million for the greater public good. That is a good use of resources that should be recognised as such by the Committee. I would challenge Opposition Members to maintain-n our high standard of health care without charge income and without raising taxes. The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey challenged the hon. Member for Fife, Central on that point: we heard little response. In general terms, we feel that the charges are a valuable contribution that people make to the increasing budgets that the Government, on behalf of the British people, devote in real terms to health care and have done throughout the lifetime of this Parliament. It is important that people who can

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
afford to do so make a contribution. It is a commonsense understanding of that principle that by asking people to make such contributions we are creating a stakeholder society—but that clearly is not the view of the hon. Member for Fife, Central.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister deal with the point that I raised about the concern of the optometrist that the increase in the real cost of items will be greater than the increase in the value of the voucher? The gap between the two will be wider and people will find it more difficult to use their vouchers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malone</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had dealt with that, but I am content to deal with it again. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman accepts that optometrists have an interest in the value of the voucher increasing. Having this year taken into account the discounting of VAT that had previously been imposed—the amount that we are taking away is considerably less than the amount added to the value of the voucher over time—I must ensure that people can get spectacles free with the voucher. I made the point to the Committee—perhaps it did not reach the hon. Gentleman—that more than 50 per cent, of people who use vouchers obtain spectacles for less than the value of the voucher.

We have had an interesting debate. It has run a familar course. I firmly believe that the measures that we have taken will support the health service in this country. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made the same comments that we have heard from the Government in previous years. Nothing that we have heard justifies the massive increases. The Government are contemptuous of the taxpayer and patients.
