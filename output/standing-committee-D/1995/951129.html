Bristol Development Corporation (Area and Constitution) Order 1995</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Sir Paul Beresford)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Bristol Development Corporation (Area and Constitution) Order 1995.</p></blockquote>
I congratulate you, Mr. Anderson, on what I understand is your first chairmanship. I am sure that it will be exceedingly orderly. The behaviour of Conservative Members will be impeccable and I am sure that that of the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) will be as superbly impeccable as ever.<br><br>
The order is one of four required to effect the wind-up of the Bristol Development Corporation. I shall refer to the other orders in a moment, but this is the only one subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.<br><br>
The order revokes the Bristol Development Corporation (Area and Constitution) Order 1988, which designated the urban development area and established the corporation. Revocation is in two stages. That part which designated the development area is to be revoked on 1 January 1996 and that part which established the corporation is to be revoked on 1 April 1996.<br><br>
Under the two-stage process, the development corporation will cease to exercise any operational functions after 31 December 1995. It is therefore appropriate that the urban development area status should cease to exist on 1 January 1996. The corporation will then enter a three-month non-operational period, during which, with minimal staff, it will prepare its final accounts and report and wind up its affairs. It will be finally dissolved as a statutory body on 1 April 1996.<br><br>
Provisions requiring the corporation to cease to act from 1 January and dissolving it on 1 April will be contained in a dissolution order, which will not be subject to any parliamentary procedure.<br><br>
The other two wind-up orders were laid before the House on 15 and 16 November and are subject to the negative resolution procedure. One transfers planning functions from the corporation to Bristol city council on 18 December. The other transfers to the Secretary of State for the Environment any property, rights and liabilities that the corporation has not disposed of by 19 December.<br><br>
Having explained the statutory requirements, I shall now give the reasons for winding up the Bristol Development Corporation. All development corporations were intended from the outset to be limited life agencies. We are able to wind them up when they have largely achieved their aims.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Development corporations were set up to provide a focused approach to the physical and economic regeneration of particularly run-down urban areas. In Bristol, an area to the east of the city centre which had suffered from decline for more than 40 years was designated. That decline was recognised by the city council in its 1988 local plan for east Bristol and in the 1985 report, "Poverty in Bristol". The problems, including dereliction and obsolete infrastructure, were therefore well known, but were considered to be the almost irreversible effects of long-term structural change in manufacturing and demographic patterns.<br><br>
The achievements of the corporation are considerable. It was established in January 1989, with a remit to revitalise the 360 hectares in its area. In July of that year it published its consultation document, "Vision for Bristol". After extensive consultation, its development strategy was produced in April 1990. That strategic vision has now been secured. By the end of the year, 64 hectares of previously derelict land will have been reclaimed, 116,000 sq m of new floor space will have been developed, almost 700 houses will have been built and 4,600 jobs will have been created. In addition, 6.4 km of road will have been provided and a private sector investment of £235 million will have been levered in. For every £1 of public money invested, the private sector will have invested £3.<br><br>
The corporation built a major new stretch of road between the M32 and the A4, now known as the Bristol spine road. That important link in the national network now carries 22,000 vehicles a day which previously either used small residential roads as rat runs or went through the congested city centre. The road has reduced delays and pollution and has opened up previously inaccessible land which, in turn, has led to major development opportunities attracting more than £200 million of private investment. All that was achieved in record time within budget and caused minimal disturbance to business premises and none to houses.<br><br>
Alongside that road is a new and hugely successful £50 million complex at Avonmeads. Within that complex is Bristol's first multiplex 14-screen cinema, a 26-lane bowling alley and several retail outlets and restaurants, some of which are reporting record attendances. But the best judges are the people of Bristol. Independent research conducted in the winter of 1994 showed that 92 per cent. of visitors thought that the Avonmeads development was something of which Bristol could be proud.<br><br>
In the Avon valley, which has lain derelict for more than 14 years, there is now a thriving urban village. More than 670 houses, many for first-time buyers, have already been built with a further 400 approved and under construction. Despite the difficulties of the market, that development, which is the largest residential development in the city, has proven a huge success. Sir Lawrie Barratt recently visited the site, declared his faith in the area and praised the corporation for its efforts. But the real measure of success is in the sales rates and the attitudes of the new residents. In November 1994, a survey of new residents showed that 97 per cent. were satisfied with the development and that 85 per cent. were willing to recommend the area to their friends.<br><br>
There are new business parks in St. Philips, St. Annes and at the Unicorn site. All provide employment and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0305">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
reverse what had been regarded as an unstoppable drift away from the city centre to out-of-town locations. The corporation has also spent much time and effort trying to secure redevelopment of the important Quay Point site which is next to Temple Meads station. The site is in a prime location and should be a worthy gateway to the city centre, but it has been derelict, or used for car parking, for many years.<br><br>
The corporation has now prepared the way for future regeneration by assembling the site in its ownership, by undertaking extensive negotiations with prospective developers and local authorities, and by granting planning permission for a comprehensive mixed-use development. Having taken matters through complex and difficult preparation stages, the corporation will shortly be transferring the site to English Partnerships. It will be for it to build on all the work that the corporation has put in to bring the development package, now at an advanced stage of negotiation, to a conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jean Corston <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the Bristol Development Corporation has not yet been able to make any proper decisions about the Quay Point site and that that will be handed to English Partnerships? The Minister will know that the developer who agreed previously to develop the site pulled out of the deal and none of us can find out why.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that the matter has almost concluded. As we are doing today with the conclusion of this urban development corporation, the site will be handed over for the work to be picked up and finalised through English Partnerships.<br><br>
As I was saying, it will be for English Partnerships to build on all the hard work that the corporation has put in to bring the development package, which is at the final stage of negotiation, to a conclusion. There is now at last an exciting prospect of securing a deal with a developer who will revitalise this important gateway to the city centre and lift confidence for the whole of the city. That would have not been possible without the Bristol Development Corporation.<br><br>
Those are all major achievements and, more so, when considered against a hostile local political background and the difficult market conditions that prevailed during the early years of the corporation's life. The achievements, although significant, are not the end of the story. The sound foundation for sustainable regeneration that the corporation has created provides major investment and job opportunities for Bristol well into the new millennium. A current forecast by independent consultants KPMG Peat Marwick is that, as a result of the corporation's activities, more than 450,000 sq m of new floor space will eventually be developed; 1,300 houses will be built, many of which will be for first-time buyers; more than 16,500 jobs will be created and £670 million of private sector investment will be attracted. That will give a final ratio of more than £8 of private money for each £1 of public money invested. Most of these potential outputs already have planning permission and should be delivered in the near future. The people of Bristol can be—and, when they see the results, will be—justifiably proud of the corporation's achievements and can thank the corporation's board and staff for the positive change that has been brought to a previously desolate area.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
The corporation has set the framework for the rebirth of central Bristol. That done, it is right to wind up the corporation and that is why the order is necessary. I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.41 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Anderson. I understand that it is your first time in the Chair and I know that you are fair, good company and knowledgeable. Your name comes top of the list of ballots for institutions within the House, proving that you have the support of Members of all parties.<br><br>
It is strange to stand on this side of the Committee Room and welcome a Government order. It is the duty of Her Majesty's loyal Opposition to oppose, but I welcome this winding up order. The Minister will, however, be unsurprised to know that my analysis of the Bristol development corporation differs somewhat from his. Perhaps that is because the development corporation area lies almost wholly within my constituency of Bristol, East. My constituents have lived through what I call the reign of the Corporation.<br><br>
Bristol is becoming used to unwelcome attention from the Government. We keep getting Ministers for Bristol although none lasts long; Bristol city council briefs them and then they go. To date, no Minister for Bristol has to my knowledge written to Bristol Members of Parliament offering to get together to talk about the city's problems and their solution. We are entitled to be sceptical.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Stern <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Lady that I have received such letters both from my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Sir T. Sainsbury) and from the Minister for Bristol. If those letters were lost in the post, I can only apologise on the Ministers' behalves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has walked into a trap. I asked the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Evans) why he had not written to me and he was apologetic. He had not written to my hon. Friends the Members for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) or for Kingswood (Mr. Berry). Perhaps he wrote only to Conservative Members; three of the five Bristol Members are Labour Members and it may be right to write to us too.<br><br>
The description that the Minister has given of the development corporation has never been wholly right. The picture on the inside cover of the corporation's document "A Strategy for Bristol" supposedly showed a derelict area but it did not look derelict, although it looked run down. Indeed, it is important to recall that the House of Lords Select Committee in 1988 said that there were even then 23,000 jobs in the area. We then got what the corporation called, "Vision for Bristol", a document with a picture on the front. Had that been a contractual document, we could have sued as what has happened is nothing like what is shown. We became used to that sort of consultation; in reality, the corporation never seemed to understand the difference between market research, public relations and consultation. For example, the questionnaire on the Bristol spine road was sent out to people in the area. the copy that I am holding has no map: it did not tell people where the road would be. All it said was, "The Bristol Spine Road". It asked whether responders lived in Bristol, if so, where and if not, where.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0306">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
It asked what use they would make of the road and what kind of transport they used. It then added something about the environment. Nowhere did it say, "Do you see a need for this road?" The consultation took place in August. If there are times when public consultation should not take place, they are Christmas, new year and August when everyone is on holiday. However, we became used to that.<br><br>
Labour Members have always opposed the creation of development corporations on the basis that they are quangos not subject to democratic control or local accountability. People can say what they like about local councils, but at least they are subject to democratic control. In Bristol, a cavalier attitude was displayed to all our local authorities from almost the beginning. It was obvious at the outset that the development corporation's proposals conflicted with the Avon structure plan. We were disappointed to discover that there was no attempt to work with local authorities in the way, in which, for example, Sheffield development corporation worked with its local authorities.<br><br>
The development corporation also said that it would create an expanding employment base, but it is the only development corporation that did no research into the framework for achieving that and the meaning of it. It claimed that it would create 19,000 jobs in phase 1. In Committee in October 1989, the Minister promised 12,000 jobs. Yet on 25 October 1995, <i>The Observer</i> recorded that the Bristol development corporation had created 2,250 new jobs in four years at a cost to the taxpayer of £56,267 for each job, which is the worst urban development corporation performance in the country. We can conclude that it was the Bristol development corporation that gave development corporations a bad name.<br><br>
According to the Department of the Environment, the national average cost of creating jobs for urban development corporations is £30,736 per job. The Bristol development corporation is £26,000 per job dearer. Even the cost of £30,736 is three times the cost of creating a job through mainstream regional policy programmes.<br><br>
The National Audit Office report of 25 August 1993 said that jobs in Bristol were claimed by the development corporation by applying density assumption to available floor space instead of quoting the actual number of jobs. In other words, the corporation said, "This square footage will provide 100 jobs. Therefore, we count 100 jobs." Surely it is better to count the actual number of jobs created. The National Audit Office also referred to the fact that development corporation expenditure on housing, social facilities and training and community programmes averaged 1 per cent. It recorded the Bristol figure as less than 0.5 per cent.<br><br>
The spine road, which is how my constituents still think of the St. Lawrence causeway, is the worst legacy of all. People in the Committee Room from the development corporation will know that I opposed it from the start for a variety of reasons. It was not wanted by local people and I thought that it would conflict with the Avon structure plan which was going to take traffic from the M32 on the Avon link road away from the city centre. The spine road was going to cost £47 million—£100 for every man, woman and child in Bristol. It could not be used by cyclists, pedestrians or buses, and there had been no
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
consultation with public transport operators. There was to be no air-quality monitoring and no lighting. It remains a private road and there is housing for the elderly within 200 m. When I raised that last point, I was told that the elderly residents would be provided with double glazing. They used to open their windows for fresh air, but they now have to keep them closed to avoid traffic fumes.<br><br>
As I said, there was a conflict with the Avon transport strategy, but the effect on the A4 at Arno's vale is, as predicted, catastrophic. At the compulsory purchase order inquiry in July 1991, someone on behalf of the development corporation said:
<br><blockquote><p>"the current volume of traffic on the A4 to the south of Arno's Vale, i.e. 16,000 vehicles between 0700 and 1900 hours, and the increase in that number in the year 2009 if the Spine Road were to be built (34,000 vehicles), as against a figure of 19,000 vehicles if the Road is not built."</p></blockquote>
On Monday morning, while travelling to a function in the southern part of my constituency, I had to turn round in the road and go by another route, because I could not get through via Arno's vale.<br><br>
To add insult to injury, the finance director of the Bristol development corporation told <i>The Observer</i> that the corporation was a special case and should not be compared with other urban development corporations, because it had
<br><blockquote><p>"absorbed the £47 million cost of a new dual carriageway across the city centre."</p></blockquote>
That was phrased as if the corporation had done us a favour, yet none of us wanted that road. Indeed, at the compulsory purchase order inquiry, not a single community group or individual spoke in favour of the road. The legacy to Bristol city council, as the successor body, will be capital maintenance costs of £1 million; we all know who will have to pay for that.<br><br>
My predecessor, Jonathan Sayeed, a Conservative, said in Committee on 17 January 1989 that local people wanted the urban development corporation. He stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"19 out of every 20 people in the local area want the UDC."</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether that was true then—I do not want to impugn my predecessor's motives or disagree with him—but it is not true now, nor has it been during the time I have been a Member of Parliament. Indeed, it was not true during the general election because local people cited his apparently slavish commitment to everything the development corporation did as a reason for not voting for him.<br><br>
A cosy relationship certainly existed. I have seen correspondence showing that Mr. Sayeed was given draft letters by the chief executive of the development corporation to use when writing to complaining constituents. I want to put it on record that I write my own letters to my constituents. I do not need anyone else to draft them for me.<br><br>
On the subject of public-private partnerships, Mr. Sayeed said, also in that Committee, that Bristol city council
<br><blockquote><p>"did not wish to co-operate with any profit-making venture to regenerate the area. It did not have the wit or the capability to do so."—[<i>Official Report, Second Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments, &c.,</i> 17 January 1989, <i>c.</i> 12.]</p></blockquote>
That seems to be an insulting manner in which to treat one's local authority. Whatever the political issues, surely it is our duty to support or, at least, to try to get on with our local authorities. Mr. Sayeed's statement was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0307">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
incorrect, even then. In 1988, the Bristol initiative had set up the president's group of the Bristol chamber of commerce initiative, of which Bristol city council was a part. The record of public-private partnerships in Bristol is second to none—it is a hallmark of Bristol life.<br><br>
Without wishing to take up too much of the Committee's time, Mr. Anderson, I should like to read out a list of those partnerships. The rubbish that we have heard about Bristol city council not knowing how to proceed with such partnerships was enough to make the chairman of the Conservative party plan a visit to the city centre—subsequently called off—on the assumption that he could cause trouble for the city council.<br><br>
The list of partnership ventures is as follows: Bristol cultural development partnership; Bristol tourism forum; Bristol 97; Western development partnership; West of England initiative; Bristol energy and environment trust; Broadmead Board Ltd; Bristol housing partnership; Building a better Bristol; Bristol regeneration partnership; Harbourside accord; and Bristol 2000. Nearly every one of those partnerships has either been set up by or joined by Bristol city council, and many have involved the Bristol chamber of commerce initiative, retailers, other local authorities, the training and enterprise council and the Trades Union Congress. That is a fine record of achievement of which any city would be proud and, indeed, Bristol is proud of it.<br><br>
The most damning indictment of the development corporation is that, in my time as a Member of Parliament for Bristol, I have not met anyone in the professions, business or commerce who has had a good word to say about the development corporation, even though one would have thought that those sections of the city would have found it easiest to co-operate with it.<br><br>
One of my constituents who lives in the development corporation area wrote a letter to one of the local <i>Bristol Observer Series</i> newspapers. It was published in last week's issue on 23 November. The paper chose to use the headline "Goodbye and Good Riddance", although I doubt whether the letter's writer insisted that it use that title. He said that we should look at the corporation's achievements:
<br><blockquote><p>"Apart from the somewhat cramped housing development at St. Annes and the NatWest building in a prime site in Old Market, there seems little to boast about.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Basically what we have is the largest car park in Bristol and a stretch of road with no provision for cyclists or pedestrians.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The Spine Road development has been dubbed little America but would more accurately be described as a somewhat substandard Disneyland with no public transport links.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>This is not what we were promised. We were told that the BDC would bring new investment and jobs to the city.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Instead we have two car showrooms, a filling station, a couple of big shops and no less than five junk food outlets.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The opening of the Showcase cinema has meant the closure of the Gaiety and a constant threat to other city centre cinemas.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>So far as employment is concerned I would dearly love to see a breakdown in the 8,000 jobs the BDC claims to have created."</p></blockquote>
I break off to say that the wild estimates of job figures are beyond belief. The Minister has given us figures different from those given by the development corporation, which are different from those given by the Department of the Environment, the National Audit Office and others. Perhaps we shall never know what they are.<br><br>
My constituent went on to say:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Does this figure include perhaps the 50 or so people who were employed for six months at the now defunct Cargo Club, surely the ugliest building in Bristol"—</p></blockquote>
it is next to, and to the detriment of, a listed building—
<br><blockquote><p>"and perhaps a fitting epitaph to this crass experiment in government interference.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The BDC—Bowling, Driving and Cinemas—has been nothing short of a disaster for the people of Bristol.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>It has cost £79 million, ruined the lives of residents living in the area and far from creating jobs has actually threatened the livelihood of local traders. I for one will be glad to see it go."</p></blockquote>
The ultimate tragedy is that so much public money has gone down the drain, which was a luxury that we could not afford. If that money had been made available to our local authorities, we might have had more jobs, because they know our system as well as anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was a very good authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well for the Minister to make a sedentary intervention—I should be happy to give way to him—but no one in Bristol will shed any tears at its demise, and some of us might even hang out the flags. Bristol city council will have to cope with the legacy, but at least it is a democratic body with a fine record in regeneration and public-private partnerships.<br><br>
In the debate on the creation of the development corporation in October 1989, my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The regeneration of Bristol's industrial base requires a strategy that complements and understands the economic developments that are under way in the city and in the region. Bristol development corporation has shown that it is singularly unfit for that task."</p></blockquote>
In response, the then Conservative Member for Kingswood, Rob Hayward, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"all I heard was the worst reactionary reflexes of a Left-wing controlled council that is trying to delay the prosperity and development of our great city."—[<i>Official Report, Second Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments, &c.,</i> 24 October 1989; <i>c.</i>10.]</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend was right and he was wrong; she is still in the House and he was rejected by the electors. I believe that she has her finger on the public pulse in a way that he did not. I am delighted that the development corporation is being wound up, and am only sorry that the legacy to Bristol city council and to council tax payers in my constituency is so uncertain and is likely to hang around our necks for some time to come.</span></p>
<p>4.59 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for long, but some of the points made by the hon. Member for Bristol, East (Ms Corston) should not go unchallenged. I served on the Committee that considered several development orders on 17 January 1989. Just as the hon. Lady was in the odd position of supporting the Government's measure the former Member of Parliament for Bristol, East, Mr. Jonathan Sayeed, and I were in the unusual position of having to lavish praise on several Labour local authorities. Unlike Bristol, which was unique in this respect at that time, they had co-operated with the development corporation, which had been "imposed on them", to use the words of numerous Labour spokesmen. It was remarkable what cities such as Sheffield could achieve when they worked with the development corporations that the Government established in derelict areas. It was equally remarkable that Bristol alone chose to adopt a confrontational policy,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0308">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
which has undoubtedly contributed to the disappointing fact that the Bristol development corporation has not achieved more. None the less, it has achieved much.<br><br>
The Bristol UDC was unique because it had to operate in an environment of local authority hostility from the start, and that situation barely changed. Legal challenges to the urban development corporation were made right from the start. The corporation knew that it had no friends on the local authority and that everything it did would depend on whether it could override the local authority's ill will. For the hon. Member for Bristol, East to suggest that it should have learned to co-operate with the councils of Bristol and Avon is like suggesting that the victim should learn to co-operate with the cannibal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the House of Lords Select Committee acknowledged some of Bristol city council's concerns in 1988? Is he aware that I and many people in the city suggested to the corporation that we use the Sheffield agreement to build co-operation, but that our proposal was rejected?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that, and I am not surprised. The ill will that the city council chose to build up by taking unnecessary and wasteful legal action to stop the corporation in its tracks could not be overcome by continuing it under the guise of an agreement. Relationships between councils and corporations worked in every other city, and that in Bristol could have worked too, had the local authority not caused it to be stillborn.<br><br>
I cannot comment in detail on conditions in the hon. Lady's constituency, which she knows far better than I do. I can, however, comment on the general matters and their effects on Bristol. I have represented my constituency since 1983. Bristol has two railway stations: the most well known is Bristol Temple Meads, and the less well known is Bristol Parkway, which is in my constituency. In my early days as a Member of Parliament, I frequently travelled to Bristol with visitors, and I used both of those stations. I stopped using Temple Meads quite quickly, however, unless I had to. Indeed, the last station I would have used if I took a visitor to Bristol would have been Temple Meads. As the train drew into Bristol through the area around Temple Meads, I would always be asked, "Why has Bristol turned itself into a unique memorial of the bombing of the second world war?" Other cities chose to get on with reconstruction and development; but Bristol was one of the slowest in the country to turn an obvious area of dereliction into something useful for the city. Such was the background to the Government's decision to establish an urban development corporation, which was given various tasks to perform.<br><br>
I wish to comment on an issue well known to me as a constituency Member. At one end of what I still refer to as the spine road—I cannot get used to fancy names—is an area for small industry in Brislington. Many people involved in that industry live in my constituency and they have spoken to me about it. Indeed, I have visited them—I should have told the hon. Member for Bristol, East earlier about my visit to an industrial unit in Brislington—and heard their comments on the effect of the spine road on that area. They made it clear that the effect was electric.<br><br>
For the first time, the spine road provided a direct link between a business growth area in Brislington and the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
motorway network. It has ben a direct and rapid link—one that people automatically use. Furthermore, it has created a link for commuters who have been able quickly to get to and from work from other parts of Bristol, which they were not able to do before.<br><br>
I am prepared to consider some of the points made by the hon. Member for Bristol, East about other aspects of the spine road. However, it would have been fairer if she had acknowledged some benefits. Bristol is a city not known for road building—after all, we still have a flyover in the centre of the city which was erected in a weekend as a temporary structure shortly after the war, and people have been talking about removing it ever since.<br><br>
Bristol, in common with any other city, needs new roads. Bristol's culture has been described as anti-road, but this was the only way in which a much-needed road could be built. For that reason if for no other, the urban development corporation will go down in the history of Bristol as the body which—unlike the council—got things done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keith Vaz <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leicester, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p>5.8 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Cope <span class='memberconstituency'>(Northavon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may speak before the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz). My constituency lies to the north of Bristol and Bath. Part of my constituency boundary is also the city boundary of Bristol. People in my constituency obviously have a great interest in ensuring that Bristol flourishes.<br><br>
For more than 20 years I have been the Member of Parliament for my constituency and I have sometimes observed a negative streak in Bristol's politics. We have heard a little of it this afternoon and my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stern) made reference to it when he spoke about attitudes toward the Bristol development corporation when it was first established. However, there is also a great tradition of enterprise and initiative going back for many centuries.<br><br>
Seven years ago, negative attitudes in Bristol were still strongly ascendent. Today, though, they are not. The enterprising elements of Bristol's politics, industry and commerce are in the lead. The row following the initial establishment of Bristol development corporation has probably been the principal catalyst for the subsequent change of attitudes.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bristol, East read out a long list of partnerships. I did not make a note of them all, but I think that most of them have been founded since the Bristol development corporation started. There is a new mood about the chamber of commerce and industry as it is now called, which did not exist seven years ago. That mood emerged largely because of the creation of the urban development corporation. In common with my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West, I believe that the corporation has made a considerable contribution.<br><br>
I cannot speak of my constituents' attitudes to the spine road, as the hon. Member for Bristol, East can, but my daughter and her family happen to live in Bristol so I use the road quite a lot to visit them. It has added greatly to my convenience and ability to do that. I have no doubt-that it has helped businesses too.<br><br>
The hon. Lady said that there had been a letter in an edition of the <i>Bristol Observer Series.</i> Unfortunately, I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0309">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
did not bring it with me, but, a week or so ago, I saw several letters in the <i>Bristol Evening</i> Post which praised the work of the Bristol development corporation and its achievements.<br><br>
From a constituency point of view, it is good that the run-down or derelict acres—we can call them what we like—in the middle of Bristol have been and are being developed. We should use such land for housing, industry, commerce and leisure—such as the excellent new cinema—instead of building out into the green belt to the north of Bristol and elsewhere, as has happened a great deal.<br><br>
I am reminded of another example of how negative attitudes in Bristol have changed during the past few years. Seven years ago, the attitude to Cribbs Causeway in my constituency, where a lot of building and retail development has taken place during 15 or more years, was that the development must be opposed and stopped because it might damage Broadmead. When permission was given and the retail development began, many people in Bristol and on the city council were opposed to it. I am glad that the attitude is different now. <i>The Bristol Evening Post</i> and others have campaigned to revive Broadmead and all sorts of plans are being put forward. That is an example of the different spirit—in fact, the old spirit—of Bristol's enterprise and initiative. I believe that the BDC, through its very creation as well as through its work, has helped by acting as a catalyst to bring forward all the partnerships mentioned by the hon. Member for Bristol, East. She frowns—presumably she does not agree—but putting the UDC in Bristol made the city think about its position and where it was going; it was going downhill. Now it is going uphill and there is much to be optimistic about. That is good for my constituents as well as for the hon. Lady's constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Corston</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will explain how that body could have been a catalyst for so much change all on its own. I disagree with him and I find his hypothesis somewhat ridiculous, especially given that the Galleries extension in Broadmead, which has helped to cement Broadmead as a regional centre, was started quite a long time ago. Surely the right hon. Gentleman does not claim that it began because of the BDC. Surely, the catalyst was the co-op pulling out of Fairfax house and the opportunities that were provided there. If Broadmead is so important, why do we have Cribbs Causeway?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Cope</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that the BDC has been the only cause of the change in attitudes. Of course, developments such as the Galleries took place before the corporation got going, but there was not the spirit of partnership and co-operation between the various bodies that there is now. I believe that the existence of the UDC shook Bristol considerably and led to a great improvement in its fortunes.</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I also begin, Mr. Anderson, by congratulating you on your arrival in the Chair. I am certain that it is because of your presence as Chairman that peace has broken out between Government and Opposition and that we will all support the order. For the record, Opposition Members will not oppose the order and divide the Committee. We hope to make rapid progress in resolving any outstanding issues.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
I do not want to add much to what my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East said. She spoke eloquently, with passion and with great knowledge and understanding of the issues that affected her constituents. I recommend all those who have interests in these matters to read her speech; on this as on all issues, she speaks with the same voice and eloquence on behalf of her constituents.<br><br>
In the next few weeks and months the Minister and I will be attending more Committees of this kind as more and more of the development corporations that were set up by the Government are wound up. I had an interesting visit to the London Docklands development corporation recently and was surprised to learn that even that will face the chop shortly.<br><br>
It was regarded as fashionable to accept development corporations as the means by which public funds could be dispensed for the regeneration of inner-city and derelict areas. However, now that we are coming to the end of the lifespan of those organisations, it is clear—certainly from what my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East said—that they have not met the targets or achieved the objectives that we wanted them to do when they were set up. That is why the next Labour Government will not create any more development corporations. Rather, we will make a rapid start on winding down the rest and ensuring that the lives of those that survive are brought to a speedy conclusion.<br><br>
You will recall, Mr. Anderson, that in December 1994 City 2020 held its annual conference in your home city of Swansea, where we saw the excellent work that Swansea council, together with the private sector, was engaged in. City 2020 has since moved to Telford, which is where this year's annual conference took place last Friday.<br><br>
Several UDC chairmen were at the conference, including Hugh Sykes, the chairman of Sheffield development corporation, and we discussed urban development corporations and what we thought was the way forward for urban regeneration. I am happy to say that that fell full square along the lines suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East. Opposition Members firmly believe in the concept of partnership between the private sector and the local authority. I do not believe, nor do I think that anyone else in the country believes that only local authorities acting on their own can achieve urban regeneration. I have not held that view since I took on my portfolio and became involved with local authorities and held meetings with different organisations and community groups.<br><br>
Local authorities themselves believe that they are not equipped to deal with the situation on their own; they want to work in such public and private sector partnerships as were outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East. The concept is one of equality; the local authority is not in the lead, nor does a separate organisation such as a development corporation decide on the way forward. Community groups do not themselves direct policy. Our concept, based on the civic forum, is that the local authority works together with the private sector and community groups in an equal partnership to draw up the vision plan for the local area and to submit that plan to the regional office and subsequently to Ministers. Those of us who listened to the Budget were very disappointed that the Chancellor—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about Bristol.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0310">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall relate what I have to say to Bristol. The Chancellor of the Exchequer did not provide additional funds for Bristol. The development corporation is being wound up, the urban programme is being abolished and the single regeneration budget is an absurd competition between various towns and cities for a diminishing amount of funds. How much of the £250 million that is supposed to be available for the whole country will reach Bristol? Where is the commitment from the Government that the same level of funding that was available for the Bristol development corporation will be available for the creation of new partnerships?<br><br>
When he winds up, the Minister should assure the Committee that the same level of funding that was available when the corporation was set up in 1989 will now be available for spending in the area that was designated for the corporation. I imagine that the Minister will say no, but he is always full of surprises and one never knows: he is always capable of fresh and radical views. We would be satisfied with such a commitment, knowing that the demise of the corporation would not mean that the extra pot of money involved would be spent on some other scheme but that it would be spent where it truly belongs.<br><br>
A general election is coming up, and my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East has told me of the effect of the boundary changes. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West would welcome a similar amount of public money being dispensed locally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would hate the hon. Gentleman to impute to me motives that I find alien. For many years it has been the practice of Bristol city council, which is not an education authority, to claim that, uniquely in the country, it should receive funding comparable with that of a number of education authorities that it has named. It is regrettable that Bristol spends far too much of its time making greater and greater demands for central Government funding, instead of getting on with running the city, as other Labour-controlled local authorities do.<br><br>
I do not join the hon. Member for Leicester, East in the plea that he makes. I should prefer him to encourage the members of Bristol city council to get on with the job for which they were elected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the <i>Bristol Evening Post</i> headline will be something like "Local MP Says We Don's Need Any More Money", and that the story beneath will make it clear that the local Member of Parliament believes that Bristol is happy with its funding allocation and can manage with what it has got, even though services have to be cut.<br><br>
I regret that view. I think people in Bristol want matters to progress, with an easy transition from the urban development corporation to a new body. Some powers will revert to the local authority, but I repeat that I have never believed that a local authority alone can deal with regeneration. Local councils such as Bristol want to work with the private sector, developing new schemes and ensuring that allocated money goes as far as possible.<br><br>
I find it extraordinary that a constituency Member of Parliament such as the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West should not want Bristol to receive any extra money. I cannot imagine that you, Mr. Anderson, would say that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
your home city of Swansea did not need any more money—I would not say that about my home city.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Ms Corston) spoke about the lessons that should be learnt. We can talk about the overall objectives of development corporations, whether they are in Bristol, Docklands or Sheffield. But the crucial issues are those that affect local people. My hon. Friend spoke about her opposition to the spine road, and often schemes such as that cause local people the greatest difficulty.<br><br>
I know how my hon. Friend feels. I was very much in favour of the Chancellor of the Exchequer cutting the roads budget and do not want a particular road to be built in my constituency simply because of the enormous damage that it would do to my constituents' lives. My hon. Friend was in a similar position. The important issue is not only the global effect of schemes on the whole locality but the way in which they affect local people and communities. There may be worthy people serving on the development corporation but they are rarely in tune with what local people want—certainly less in tune than people such as my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East or those sitting on the city council. That is why we need this unique partnership—to move forward and develop new links.<br><br>
I wish to speak about English Partnerships taking on some of the roles previously allotted to the development corporation. The role of English Partnerships needs a thorough review. We must consider what it has achieved over the past few years. It is only just getting into the swing of things. Additional powers should not be given to quangos without greater responsibility and accountability to local people. I hope that we shall consider the issue more carefully before we proceed.<br><br>
We support the order. If the Minister wishes to divide the Committee, we shall go with him—with all the massed forces here today! May I thank you, Mr. Anderson, for chairing the Committee in such a pleasant and fair way. We hope that we shall address you again when you chair some future Committee.</span></p>
<p>5.26 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A few words need to be said. I have visited Bristol a few times and gained a fairly detailed impression of the area. I once accepted an invitation from the BBC to visit Bristol, which was declined by the hon. Member for Bristol, East. That is perhaps an example of partnership—or the lack of it.<br><br>
What I saw in Bristol confirms what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West and by my right hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Sir J. Cope). Bristol is a delightful city with enormous potential. It could be the gateway to the south-west; yet there are acres upon acres of dereliction that have been there for decades. It has required the stimulation of the development corporation to bring about improvements. Improvement has started; it is on the way.<br><br>
I shall provide an example of the attitude current in early days. The late Lord Ridley, as Secretary of State, originally proposed an area to the east of the city centre, close to the main railway station at Temple Meads which would extend through the Avon valley—a total of 420 hectares. Bristol city council petitioned against this proposal and, following a detailed hearing, four areas—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0311">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
totalling 60 hectares—were excluded from this urban development. A site at Bond street and Newfoundland road was withdrawn because Bristol city councillors claimed to have developers of their own who would shortly redevelop the area in a comprehensive fashion. I have to report that, seven years later, this prominent site remains as derelict as it was then and as it has been for over 15 years.<br><br>
There is a notable change of attitude in the area. It can be seen—I am citing an article by the <i>Western Daily Press</i>—in the go-ahead given to a flagship regeneration scheme by the city council and Avon county council. It was backed by Councillor Robertson, the Labour leader of the city council. However, Labour critics on the council were split on the issue. So we are still not yet there. The title of another article in the local paper was
<br><blockquote><p>"Fast Track Quango got a City Moving".</p></blockquote>
At least somebody is prepared to spell out the truth.<br><br>
In time, people will recognise the positive changes that have occurred. There has been a change; even the Labour party has come our way. It has finally realised that municipal authorities—such as the Bristol authority—do not always know the best way forward and that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
partnership is the answer. That explains the backing for the SRB from many Labour authorities—I met the leader of one such authority today. But we must recognise, and express the Committee's gratitude for, the work of the corporation's chairman, Christopher Thomas, and of his board members and dedicated staff. The great successes would not have been achieved without their enthusiasm.<br><br>
Avon county council and the development corporation will both close on 31 March 1996. Bristol is a great city with a great past. I have walked its beautiful streets. I was sorry about the rubbish, but the flowers were superb. The new unitary Bristol city council must take the opportunity that it has been given to ensure that its positive legacy from the development corporation is built on.<br><br>
I thank you, Mr. Anderson, for your eloquent Chairmanship of our proceedings, and commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>

<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Bristol Development Corporation (Area and Constitution) Order 1995.</p></blockquote></p>
