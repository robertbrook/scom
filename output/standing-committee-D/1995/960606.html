Draft Northern Ireland (Emergency and Prevention of Terrorism Provisions) (Continuance) Order 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Sir John Wheeler)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Northern Ireland (Emergency and Prevention of Terrorism Provisions) (Continuance) Order 1996.</p></blockquote>
I seek the Committee's agreement to continue in force the temporary provisions of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1991 from midnight on 15 June, when they would otherwise lapse, until 25 August, when the Act will be repealed and replaced by successor legislation. The Emergency Provisions Bill, that successor legislation, has been the subject of considerable debate in Standing Committee and in the House. The Bill is due to return from another place later this month. Because in general terms the Bill replicates the current Act, the recent debates on its provisions have served to diminish somewhat the usual significance of this morning's debate.<br><br>
It is the House's regular annual duty to consider the renewal of the temporary provisions of the Emergency Provisions Act and it has been usual for the renewal debate to provide the focus for a wide-ranging review of the security situation and related political scene. This year the House has already signalled its support for the continuance of very similar provisions for a further two years from August, and it is necessary to avoid creating the gap in the law that would occur if this order were not approved.<br><br>
With your permission Sir James, I shall take the opportunity to reiterate briefly the Government's position on the continuance of the emergency legislation. The Government have consistently said that the legislation will remain on the statue book only for as long as necessary. At last year's renewal debate in the House on 12 June, my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I profoundly hope that the time will soon come when the emergency legislation will have finally served its purpose …".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 12 June 1995; Vol. 261, c. 511.]</p></blockquote>
That was said just 12 months ago, and until the Provisional IRA's betrayal of the peace process in February of this year it seemed that a time might indeed soon come when the emergency legislation would no longer be needed.<br><br>
Against the background of the prevailing ceasefires, the Government instituted a wide-ranging, independent and authoritative review of the need for counter-terrorist legislation across the whole of the United Kingdom. In January this year my right hon. and learned Friend the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
Secretary of State announced the commencement of that review, which is led by the noble Lord Lloyd of Berwick, who is assisted on Northern Ireland matters by Sir Brian Kerr of the Northern Ireland High Court.<br><br>
Lord Lloyd's terms of reference are
<br><blockquote><p>"to consider the future need for specific counter terrorism legislation in the United Kingdom if the cessation of violence connected with the affairs of Northern Ireland leads to a lasting peace, taking into account the threat from other kinds of terrorism and the United Kingdom's obligations under international law; and to make recommendations".</p></blockquote>
We look forward to considering Lord Lloyd's recommendations when he reports to my right hon. and learned Friends the Secretary of State and the Home Secretary this autumn. But it will, of course, be for the Government, not for Lord Lloyd, to determine when the circumstances that are described in his terms of reference have come about.<br><br>
This year, because the successor legislation has been the subject of our attention, the Government have not commissioned the usual annual independent report on the operation of the legislation. As hon. Members are aware, those reports have been conducted in recent years by John Rowe QC. He also carried out the quinquennial review of the Act which was published in May of last year and which significantly informed consideration of the successor legislation. We are grateful to Mr. Rowe for his careful and balanced examination and assessment of the provisions and for the clarity of presentation of his report. We are also most grateful to the independent commissioner for the holding centres, Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC, and his deputy Dr. Norris, and to the independent assessor of military complaints procedures, Mr. Hewitt, for their annual reports which were published in the spring. Both reports were written during the period of the ceasefire which PIRA chose to bring to a cruel end. In his report Sir Louis said:
<br><blockquote><p>"On the assumption that there is no reversion to conditions pre-September 1994, Easter-time 1997 could optimistically be viewed as the terminal date of emergency legislation for the Province. We do not expect to see the three Holding centres functioning after then …"</p></blockquote>
He also called for the Government to announce that Castlereagh holding centre would be abandoned.<br><br>
We had all hoped that the cessation of military operations announced by PIRA would develop into a full and genuine peace with the result that the emergency legislation and the continued use of Castlereagh and the other holding centres would no longer be needed. However, in the current circumstances the Chief Constable and the Police Authority for Northern Ireland are of the view that a number of RUC requirements, including several new police stations, have a higher priority than the replacement of Castlereagh. The Secretary of State and I accept their advice. I can give the Committee an assurance, however, that the question of a replacement for Castlereagh will be kept under review in the light of developments in the security situation. Its use has certainly lessened: the average monthly throughput figure for 1995 was only 24 persons, compared with an average monthly figure of 121 persons for the first eight months of 1994, prior to the PIRA ceasefire.<br><br>
The RUC have reviewed their prohibition on reading material, and a small library of topical magazines is now available for detainees on request, as is the Bible. The RUC have not accepted Sir Louis's recommendation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0101">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
concerning the provision of writing material, which they say detainees might use to inflict injuries on themselves in an attempt to damage the reputation of the police.<br><br>
The commissioner states at the end of his report:
<br><blockquote><p>"In our first two annual reports we stated that we had found absolutely nothing that might give anyone the slightest cause for concern about the care and treatment of detainees held in the custody of uniformed officers of the RUC. We repeat that finding, without any hesitation."</p></blockquote>
That is an important and welcome reassurance and I hope that the Committee will join me in thanking Sir Louis and Dr. Norris for the impressive number of visits that they make regularly to each of the holding centres on an unannounced basis.<br><br>
Our thanks go too to the independent assessor, Mr. Hewitt, whose report was also published in the spring. The Committee will be glad to note that only 19 formal non-criminal complaints were made against the armed forces in the whole of 1995; indeed, only three formal non-criminal complaints have been received since last July. I know that the Committee will agree that those figures are impressive. This year the assessor made two recommendations concerning the processing of complaints. I am pleased to say that the new General Officer Commanding Northern Ireland has been able to accept both of them.<br><br>
Before I turn to the current security situation, I know that the Committee will welcome an update on the introduction of silent video recording in the holding centres. My officials have been engaged in extensive discussions with members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Police Authority and substantial progress has been made both on the technical side and on the work to prepare a code of practice. I can advise the Committee that a draft code of practice is now well advanced. The code of practice will be published for public consultation in due course as will be required under the new legislation.<br><br>
On the political front, we are looking forward to the beginning of all-party negotiations on Monday 10 June. Our aim is to secure a comprehensive political settlement which will be widely acceptable to the people of Northern Ireland and provide a foundation for a peaceful and politically stable future—to the benefit of all. We fervently hope that the Provisional IRA will declare a fresh ceasefire, making it possible for Sinn Fein to take its place at the table. Nothing less will end the continuing tension of the prevailing phoney war and the dark and lurking threat of worse to come. This tension is sustained by the continuing relentless round of savage punishment attacks; it is essential that it be contained as we enter the height of the marching season. Compromise is the key, and I urge all those who hold positions of influence in the community, on both sides, to work with the security forces and support their efforts to ensure that lawful demonstrations and parades pass peacefully.<br><br>
I shall conclude my opening remarks on a positive note. Northern Ireland is poised to enter a new phase in the peace process. We sincerely hope that we can bring together around the negotiating table representatives of all the democratically elected parties and that through meaningful dialogue a lasting peace will be secured. Until that happens, Northern Ireland will remain in an emergency situation and the security forces will continue to need the emergency powers. No responsible
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Government would have it otherwise, and no responsible Government would hold in the present climate that the provisions are obsolete.<br><br>
As I have said, the peace process is entering a new phase. All parties which are genuinely committed to democratic and peaceful methods of furthering their political aims and which commit to the Mitchell principles will be entitled to take part in all-party talks and negotiations for peace. That is the agenda. That is the goal—peace. And that is what we shall continue to strive to achieve.</span></p>
<p>10.44 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his full explanation of the order. It would have been appropriate for him to express some regret that we have to deal with an order that will last a mere 10 weeks. Had the Government got their timing right, as they should have done, we would not have needed to be here—one piece of legislation would have flowed into the other. It would have been appropriate for the Minister to say that had the Government acted more timeously, we would not have needed to renew the order in this way.<br><br>
I am not going to speak at length this morning because, as the Minister said, we spent many hours on this matter earlier this year. It does not seem appropriate to go over it all again. The House has expressed its opinion that a new short-term EPA should be in existence for two years.<br><br>
The Opposition opposed the EPA on Second Reading because of discontent about certain aspects. Our main doubts were about the preservation on the statute book of internment and abut the regime in the holding centres, to which I shall return later. We also objected to the preservation of seven-day detention without access to lawyers, and we wanted the police, wherever possible and as a matter of policy, to indicate their wish to use PACE powers rather than exceptional powers. I hope that the Minister will tell the Committee what progress has been made in that regard.<br><br>
The Committee is sitting today not because of the Government but because of the IRA. The IRA could remove the need for any emergency powers very easily. It would merely have to indicate that there will be an unequivocal ceasefire and that it is willing to decommission weapons.<br><br>
The announcement made in the past few days that there will be no decommissioning of weapons until a satisfactory constitutional agreement has been concluded makes it very difficult to do away with provisions such as this. No statement could be clearer than the IRA's, however: the people of Northern Ireland will literally have guns held to their heads for the foreseeable future. The IRA's negotiating tactics are to talk peace through Sinn Fein, but still to retain its weaponry.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will give more details about the Lloyd review. I was relieved to hear that there has been no further slippage with that review and that the Minister has again given a commitment that Lloyd is likely to report in the autumn. Given the differences of interpretation in the use of words such as "autumn", it would be helpful if the Government could be a bit more specific. The deadline was the summer, but that has slipped to autumn. Will the Minister confirm that, in the Government's understanding, "autumn" will extend no further than October?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0102">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
I was pleased with the report on progress in the holding centres. No headlines were grabbed by the revelation that people in the holding centres were to be allowed to read, but the statement was welcome. Will the Minister refresh my memory about what is to happen with the draft code of practice? Will that code require the attention of the House in a debate here when it is produced? If so, when will that be? The Minister said that the code of practice was well advanced. So it should be, but will hon. Members have to discuss the draft before the House rises for the summer? When will the draft code appear?<br><br>
The Minister did not refer to the European Court judgment on seven-day detention which, as he will know, was adverse for the Government of the country concerned. Have the Government taken action to amend our legislation or are they simply waiting for the Lloyd review to deal with the issue? Are other cases threatening to put us into the European Court's bad books?<br><br>
Given the great fall in the numbers involved, I assume that we are avoiding restricting access to lawyers to people in the holding centres. Given the fall in the number of people held in them, it would be interesting to know whether any of the holding centres—three places are currently designated as such—are not being used. The Minister said that 24 people had recently been held, so it would be excessive for us to staff three holding centres. Do the Government propose to alter that arrangement?<br><br>
The only other issue on which I would welcome the Government's comments is the progressive use of PACE powers. Is the RUC's policy to use them wherever possible? If so, why does the Chief Constable not make that clear? At some stage—we all hope that it will be sooner, rather than later—normal laws will have to be introduced. No one believes that that will happen overnight, or, for example, that we shall move overnight from Diplock courts to normal jury trials. Will the Government tell us what progress is being made towards using PACE, rather than emergency powers?</span></p>
<p>10.52 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ken Maginnis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington), I shall not deal with matters that were fully examined when we debated the new Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill a few months ago. Instead, I want to consider why we need to ensure that there is no gap in the legislation that deals with terrorism in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I doubt whether the IRA will not indulge in punitive activity against our society in Northern Ireland—it most certainly will. If we evaluate the IRA's activity, however, we see that it is very much a beaten docket. After 25 years of terrorism, it has not gained a military victory; nor is it likely to. The vast majority of people from both traditions in Northern Ireland are steadfastly opposed to violence and have demonstrated their feelings in the past few years.<br><br>
The IRA recognised that that was the case as far back as 1990, when it endeavoured to celebrate under the slogan, "20 years and still not defeated"—a rather negative celebration, which evoked the reciprocal thought, "20 years and not winning". In the ensuing four years, the IRA endeavoured to step up the level of its campaign, but without any military success. Most people have viewed the situation in those terms.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
IRA/Sinn Fein also embarked with greater intensity on a political campaign. Until the most recent election, it attracted the support of only 5 per cent. of the electorate. That has now doubled, but not many people will be fooled by what has happened—at least if they have been in Northern Ireland and seen the presidential-type campaign waged by the IRA in the run-up to the election. There were photographs of Gerry Adams bearing the caption "Vote for Peace".<br><br>
The hunger within the republican community induced some people to believe that Gerry Adams was perhaps different from run-of-the-mill members of IRAJ/Sinn Fein and that with their support he would be able to bring about an IRA ceasefire. Ultimately, they believed that that might lead to peace in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I must caution people that that is not the case. I draw the attention of the optimistic and well-meaning hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie to the terms of the statement that was issued by the IRA yesterday evening, which said that the likelihood of any IRA ceasefire is remote in the extreme. I hope that hon. Members will recall that I had already cautioned that there would be no ceasefire. The statement continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"The IRA will not be decommissioning its weapons through either the front or the back door",</p></blockquote>
and by way of excuse states:
<br><blockquote><p>"We will never leave nationalist areas defenceless"—and now come the crucial words, on which I ask people to ponder—"this side of a final settlement".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie may believe that that has something to do with the present peace process coming to a conclusion in which constitutional politicians arrive at some sort of compromise, agreement or accommodation. But it does not mean that. A "final settlement" is a phrase dating back to 75 years ago in Northern Ireland history. It refers to the IRA's narrow political objective—and we should all recognise how narrow it is. It is all part of "Brits out" and a united Ireland. There is no equivocation on that demand. That is what is meant by a final settlement and that is the basis of my caution to the Committee—that we must examine legislation that is necessary to counter those with such evil intent.<br><br>
We must assume that constitutional parties, heeding the will of the vast majority of our society as expressed through the ballot box, will recognise that the political objectives of the IRA have been beaten: if Governments honour the political will of Northern Ireland society as expressed through the ballot box, the IRA cannot reasonably expect to achieve a united Ireland or "Brits out". There will be no final settlement within the lifetime of any member of the Committee, or far beyond that.<br><br>
There is one comfort. For many years, the IRA derived support in such places as America through the mystique of its so-called armed struggle. There was a total misunderstanding of what was referred to as the British presence in Northern Ireland and there was little realisation that that in fact meant people such as me who have, with a name like Maginnis, probably been there for a heck of a long time—long before the arrival of people with names like Adams and Hume and Morrison and certainly before people like Cathal Brugha, who was earlier known as Charles Burgess. My Irish might not be up to going through a list of people like Sean MacStiofan, Sean Stevenson, who conveniently became Irish

nationalists in their first or second generation on the island. Many of us who are British have been there for hundreds of years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a wonderful capacity for digressing without the benefit of an intervention, but surely his main point was that one of the advantages that we have gained over the past few months is that the Unionist case is much better understood in Washington. Is not it good news that the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues have been to America and explained their case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) was concluding the background portion of his speech and was coming back to the matter of security.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You know me only too well, Sir James. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith) will know that it is exceedingly difficult for an old village schoolmaster to abbreviate things, especially when he has willing students who wish to learn.<br><br>
I was indeed coming to the issue of the IRA's recent exposure to the international community through Adam's visits to America, where the mystique was removed and the reality became more apparent, partly due to my party's efforts in that country and elsewhere. We also persuaded our Government to take the courageous step of inviting an international body to examine the whole question of disarmament and verification and that was yet another defeat for the IRA Sinn Fein.<br><br>
In the light of that, we must point out that times will continue to be difficult as we face that small group of evil people who set their sights on a "final settlement". It makes me ponder the current situation in which we are placing our security services at a disadvantage, not by having the legislation on the statute book, but by having it on the statute book and not using it to the extent that is still required.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Devlin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always worried when anyone rises to speak with a bottle in his hand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Devlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am greatly concerned about talk of a final settlement—it has unwelcome historical overtones—but the fact is that there will not be an acceptable final settlement. The hon. Gentleman gave us a little historical essay about his right to talk on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland when he knows full well, coming from Tyrone, that there are families which predate his—for example, the Devlin family of Tyrone goes back two or three millennia, let alone two or three centuries. In the light of that, if we are to discuss coming to a positive arrangement, people will have to consider the future rather than churning over the past again and again. They must start to talk positively about how they will live together instead of about final settlements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says nothing with which I would disagree, except that I suspect that he has done me a disservice by suggesting that the Maginnis family has only been in Ireland for the past two or three centuries. I shall not go into the history of that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
I want the Minister to address how the PACE legislation enables the police in Great Britain to go round knocking on doors in the early hours of the morning to counter the threat of football hooliganism, but seems unable to deal with the threat to the lives of the civilian population in Northern Ireland. The Minster knows the answer to that; he knows that it has to do with the ability to obtain evidence and that is for that reason more than any other that we require the continuance of the emergency provisions legislation.<br><br>
On the seven-day detention issue, I draw the attention of the hon. member for Clydebank and Milngavie and of the Minister to the fact that although seven-day detention was frowned on in certain quarters, not least from within the Irish Republic when it was applied to the fight against terrorism in Northern Ireland, the same Irish Republic is about to introduce seven-day detention for dealing with the problem of drug trafficking within its jurisdiction.<br><br>
On those issues, it is important that whatever out desire for peace—and my desire for peace is no less, perhaps much greater from a personal point of view, than that of anyone in this Room—we must ensure that we do not fall victim to the euphemisms of the IRA/Sinn Fein. The final settlement is not an offer of peace within our lifetimes as far as they are concerned. Rather, it is a threat that they will never compromise, irrespective of the democratically expressed wishes of society from within both traditions in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p>11.10 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to reply to this brief but important debate. I should like to refer at the outset to the remarks of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. He is indeed a prophet in his own land, as you, Sir James, know only too well. He always accurately describes the unfortunate state of play with the Provisional IRA. I sometimes wonder whether he has access to the same detailed information that I have from time to time. He is right to say that the Provisional IRA has said that it will not renew the ceasefire; it also referred to this side of a "final settlement", whatever that may mean.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that there will be no gap in the Emergency Provisions Act. The successor legislation will repeal the current Act and will come into force immediately, so there is no question of a gap in the law that would be harmful to the people of Northern Ireland. I can also assure him that the arrests were made under the relevant public order offences applicable to the conduct in question. He referred to knocking on doors and the hour of the day or night when the police may call. The RUC will use all the appropriate legislation as necessary to deal with the events that it investigates from time to time.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie asked several questions and I hope that I can provide some brief answers. He wanted to know whether the Lloyd review is still on target to report by the autumn and he queried the word autumn. As you know, Sir James, autumn in Northern Ireland seems to last 12 months with brief intermissions—sometimes—in the middle of the year. Autumn in England and Wales, however, has more definition and I can assure the hon. Gentleman that Lord Lloyd will indeed report by October.<br><br>
In answer to the hon. Gentlemen's question about the closure of the holding centres, the fact is that the Government would like to close them. However, as long

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
as the situation remains as it is, with a serious threat of a return to high-level violence and with the Provisional IRA unhappily retaining all its capability, all its weapons, all its Semtex, its entire structure and all its known illegal activities, the Government would be severely remiss if they took from the RUC the buildings and facilities that it may require should the situation deteriorate. We hope that it will not, but those facilities must be available in the meantime.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie also asked about the code of practice for silent video recording. Under the legislation, the code is required to undergo public consultation. Not only the wider public, therefore, but all hon. Members will be able to participate in that exercise. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will certainly consider carefully any representations that are made to him. The draft code will then be laid before both Houses of Parliament and will be brought into operation by an order made by my right hon. and learned Friend. There is therefore an opportunity for those who want to be involved in detailed comment and analysis to do so.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred also to the internment provisions in the legislation. The Government intend that the provisions for executive detention should remain suspended when the Bill is enacted. However, it is only prudent to retain the provisions for as long as the threat of a significant increase in terrorist activity remains. I remind the Committee that the Republic of Ireland has similar provisions in its criminal justice system. Both Governments therefore see the threat to democracy and wish to retain this significant power for use if and when it is considered necessary.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie also asked about the European Court of Human Rights judgment concerning the Murray case and inferences from silence. I can assure him that the Government are considering with care the terms of the Murray judgment. Our initial view is that primary legislation is likely to be necessary to give effect to that judgment, both in Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. However, in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
the meantime the Government will do everything possible in administrative terms to implement the spirit of the judgment. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the Royal Ulster Constabulary's use of PACE powers. That matter was discussed extensively during the Committee stage of the Bill. I can confirm that the RUC uses the EPA powers only when necessary. Those powers were certainly used much less during the ceasefire period. As long as the terrorist gangs use violence for political ends, the RUC will need the EPA powers for use in serious situations.<br><br>
As I have said before, if the peace process becomes genuinely—and I emphasise the word "genuinely"—established, the EPA will be suspended and eventually repealed. That will leave the RUC, free from the threat of terrorism, to rely on the ordinary law and on non-emergency legislation to deal with crime under the PACE provisions. I know that all hon. Members hope that that day will come eventually.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister emphasises the need for a real and genuine ceasefire. Am I right to assume that he is not alluding to a declaration but to tangible evidence, such as a verified disarmament process?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that that is indeed the case. The Committee will know that the Mitchell report was a compromise. However, its six principles make it clear that there must be disarmament, that the terrorist gangs must be stood down and that the stocks of Semtex and munitions must be surrendered and disposed of. The hon. Gentleman is right: the situation will not be what we want it to be until that day comes. I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Northern Ireland (Emergency and Prevention of Terrorism Provisions) (Continuance) Order 1996.</p></blockquote></p>
