	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Committee I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on both counts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are seeking powers to test a new approach to help unemployed people back to work. These regulations, if approved, will enable us to do that through the project work pilots. The regulations are made under powers in section 29 of the Jobseekers Act 1995. That allows pilots of changes to benefit regulations to be set up in limited geographical areas and for a limited, specified period of time. The 1995 Act provides that such regulations must be made
	<br><blockquote><p>"with a view to ascertaining whether their provisions will, or will be likely to, encourage persons to obtain or remain in work".</p></blockquote>
That is precisely the aim of project work. The pilots are targeted on people who have been out of work for two years or more. Experience tells us that those people need special help to find work. The pilots aim to build on, and extend, the approaches to assisting long-term unemployed people that we have developed with some success in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will introduce the regulations to the Committee first by describing how the pilots will work and how they are designed to meet the particular needs of people out of work for a very long time, and, secondly, by detailing the particular powers that the regulations would introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pilots will be operated by the employment service in two locations—the Hull and Medway and Maidstone travel-to-work areas. They will apply to all people aged 18 to 50 in those areas who have been claiming unemployment benefits for two years or more. We expect around 8,000 to 9,000 people in total to fall into that group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When people in the client group attend their first six-monthly restart interview in the pilot, they enter the first
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
part of the pilot, which lasts for 13 weeks. In that period unemployed people are offered intensive and structured help with job search. They will be offered a series of regular advisory interviews to help identify more clearly the barriers to finding a job, and to develop an action plan. The main aim will be to submit people to suitable jobs. But other help will be available for those who need it. They may be referred to job clubs for further help in looking for jobs, or to training for work to improve their skills. A jobfinders grant of between £100 and £400 will also be available to help overcome financial problems in taking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will in addition aim to put unemployed people in direct touch with employers through trial periods during which they can demonstrate their abilities in a job while remaining on benefit. And employers who recruit people from the pilot will be able to claim a workstart subsidy of up to £1,500.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will welcome these proposals, and, in particular, that it will wish to note the use of workstart. This approach, which we have tested in separate trials, was advocated by the Select Committee on Employment in its recent report on workfare. It has, of course, received robust support from my Hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk (Sir R. Howell), who has taken a strong and consistent interest in these issues over a long period. For some people, the intensive voluntary help which I have just described has already begun.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope very much that the great deal of help given in the first 13 weeks will enable many people to find work. If, however, after this period, they are still claiming unemployment benefits, they will be allocated a place on a work experience programme, which will last for a further 13 weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work experience element of project work will be provided under contract, and will involve projects of value to the community. In most cases, people will carry out 18 hours of work experience each week and, in addition, three hours of supervised job search activity. Unemployed people who take part will gain valuable and up-to-date work experience to help demonstrate their abilities to employers. Importantly, they will also continue—with structured help—to look for work. Indeed, providers' contracts are likely to contain incentives to find work for participants. We intend that the full period of work experience should be available, even if there are short interruptions. People may, for example, start work experience but leave for a short spell, perhaps to take a job. If they return to benefit, having failed to stay in employment, they will be given a further place on a work experience project, to complete their full 13 weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect that the vast majority of people will welcome the opportunity to take part in work experience. However, if an unemployed person refused to participate without good cause, benefit would be disallowed for up to 14 days in the first instance, and for periods of up to 28 days beyond that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past few years we have developed a wide range of programmes that have had success in improving the prospects of long-term unemployed people getting back to work. The new approach of project work builds on that experience. The pilots are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0630">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
designed specifically to tackle the main problems that face people after a long spell of unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, they may simply lose touch with the labour market. Their skills may become out of date; their search for work may become unrealistic. The pilots will provide intensive help to put these problems right. Secondly, employers may lack the confidence to take them on without recent work experience. Worktrials, workstart and, of course, the period of work experience help to tackle that problem. Thirdly, unemployed people may merely lose hope, and become demotivated. In those circumstances we have found that a requirement to attend a programme of structured help or advice can be the galvanising factor that leads to fresh hope and purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement to attend work experience in project work also helps to reinfoce a view that has gained considerable ground in recent years—that if people have been out of work for a long time, while the Government clearly have an obligation to provide financial support the taxpayer also has a right to expect that they will take positive steps to improve their own prospects of finding work. I have no doubt that the vast majority of unemployed people wants to work. But, for the few who have no intention of seeking a job, or who are claiming fraudulently, I would expect project work to offer a deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the committee will see, the project work process is intensive and contains many different elements of help for unemployed people. The regulations that we are discussing concern one important aspect of the pilots—making people who fail to attend the work experience element subject to benefit sanctions. The regulations would provide that power under the income support legislation, which will apply until October this year, and to the jobseekers allowance once that is implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The income support regulations were sent to the Social Security Advisory Committee in December, immediately following the announcement of the pilots. The SSAC decided not to consult in late February, and the income support and JSA pilot regulations were laid before the House in March. The first referrals to project work, for which the regulations will be needed, will take place in July, and we look to Committee members for support in approving them, so that the project work placements can go ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both sets of regulations make similar provisions. People who fail to attend the work experience element will be subject to benefit disallowance for up to 14 days on the first occasion, and up to 28 days on subject instances. We have designed the regulations so that they match as far as possible the general sanctions regime that will apply under JSA. However, we have built in a number of important safeguards. First, the requirement to attend must be issued properly. Written notice must be given to the unemployed person, and sanctions cannot apply unless there is a place available on work experience. Secondly, the normal rules for access to hardship payments will apply both under income support and JSA. Thirdly, those who can show good cause for not attending project work wil not be subject to sanction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The provisions list a number of specific examples of good cause. I would draw the Committee's attention in particular to those covering people with caring responsibilities. There is also a general good cause provision to cover circumstances that may provide a genuine reason not to attend, but that we have not been able to foresee in the detailed list. Decisions will of course be taken by independent adjudication officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the suggestion of the SSAC, we included in the income support pilot regulations a general provision on good cause. I understand that the Committee welcomed that and, in the light of the provision and certain other assurances on the position of people doing voluntary work, decided not to put the regulations out for general consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will recognise that these regulations come forward to enable a process that has been designed with care. It is based on considerable practical experience of helping long-term unemployed people to find work. The regulations have been considered by the SSAC, and we have taken on board its comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall, of course, monitor and evaluate the results of project work most carefully. We shall be looking to see how far the approach helps unemployed people to find work when otherwise they would have remained on benefit. We shall consider what new light project work throws on the problems that people out of work for a long time have in getting a job. We shall take that fully into account when deciding further measures to help such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is urgent that we provide extra help for the very long-term unemployed. All the evidence of the past suggests that people unfortunate enough to be out of work for two years or more may be left behind by the recovery unless we provide a special effort to assist them. Further, without help, people may tend to become dependent on state benefits and discouraged about their chances of getting back to work. Our experience shows that a period on work experience can be the key to restoring confidence and independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By approving the regulations, the Committee will enable the Government to test out a carefully devised programme of intensive help for people who need it most in the improving labour market. I am sure that the Committee will support that aim, and that it will support the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.41 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) will deal with some of the more technical matters relating to income support. I shall begin by saying that the Labour party does not oppose the principle of pilot projects as a fresh way of giving people opportunities to re-enter the labour market. People who have been out of that market for a long time need special help; the more one is out of work, the harder it is to get back into work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schemes that are introduced with sensitivity and provide genuine opportunities to improve people's employability, by giving them hope, motivation and new skills, are to be welcomed. But do these regulations
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0631">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
belong in that category? Or do they—as I believe—merely shift resources from the community action programme and mask the fact that their impact, because of the complete removal of resources, will be huge outside the two areas where the pilot projects will take place?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the regulations will be that thousands of people who have benefited from the work experience element of the CAP will be abandoned for the sake of the pilot projects. The regulations do not mean that new resources will be provided to see whether the CAP can be improved. The pilot project is being offered instead of any new resources. Nor is it national: it is very narrowly defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would not be so bad were there not such a huge withdrawal of resources from the job-seeking activities of people outside the pilot projects. The Government are playing groups of unemployed people off against one another. The additional resources in Medway and Hull are made available at the expense of schemes in my constituency, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Withington and in the constituencies of Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The closing down of other schemes has in some cases caused huge dislocation: people who were given commitments and contracts only months ago had those contracts withdrawn shortly before Christmas. The commitments that had been given, the programmes that were set up, the interaction that had taken place between local authorities, agencies and the private sector—all of that was abandoned, almost at a moment's notice, to pay for the pilot projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot claim that that is not so. I have been given a briefing note in which the Minister's officials provided him with answers to possibly difficult media questions about these regulations. I congratulate those officials and hope an incoming Labour Government will get the same help. One question asked why the community action programme was being closed when it had been such a success. The Minister's answer was provided, as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You will be aware that all Government Departments' budgets have been under very close scrutiny this year. It was quite clear that money would not be available for Community Action to continue at current levels. It was generally accepted that Community Action could not remain viable, as a National programme, if places were cut further and closure, leading to the provision of more but cheaper provision, was seen as the preferred option."</p></blockquote>
So it is a budget cut; it has absolutely nothing to do with improving the employability of the long-term unemployed. The Government have so cut into a national job creation programme that it is on the point of collapse and they have decided to phase it out, rather than allow it to collapse. Then, by setting up a small pilot scheme, they give the impression that they are taking new and fresh initiatives to end the misery for the long-term unemployed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can see that I have no briefing up my sleeve or, indeed, in my hands, so this intervention is in free flight and the hon. Gentleman can judge the result accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put his comments in context, no programme need last for ever. It is surely the job of the Department for Education and Employment and of the Government to
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
review the effectiveness of any programme in operation from time to time. We took the view that community action had been valuable in its context, but had become less valuable as time went on and should be replaced by more targeted approaches as represented by project work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume from the hon. Gentleman's comments that he is making a spending commitment on behalf of his party and that he has the approval of the hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) to make such a commitment on the full restoration of the community action programme. I look forward to him endorsing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is playing silly politics again. We have already set out our options for training and how they will be paid for by my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East. There is no problem about that. We are in Committee to discuss the Minister's current action, not what the new Minister's actions will be. The Minister will have the opportunity to discuss the new Minister's actions with me after the general election, if he is still here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the scheme was a success. The Minister cannot wriggle out of that. What has happened to the 40,000 people who were to go on the CAP? What will happen to them? Was the target range for the new scheme 6,000 to 9,000 people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Pilot work, yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That leaves a gap of between 31,000 and 34,000 people, but that is considered a benefit for the long-term unemployed. That figure represents a net loss of places and resources, not a net gain. What will be the circumstances for those areas outside the pilot project that had a commitment on the schemes that were in place? What additional assistance will the Minister provide to training and enterprise councils, for example, or to other providers to take up the slack—the 30,000-odd net loss of places—and to assist the long-term unemployed? What will happen beyond the pilot areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misses the point. The total number of opportunities that we are offering is maintained at a similar level as previously, but we are switching the emphasis from the very expensive community action type approach to the much more effective targeted approach of one-to-one counselling and a range of other programmes that continue to be on offer to people in areas where the CAP has been brought to an end. It is a switch of emphasis; it is not as if we have just dropped the people involved. We are giving them help in a different and more targeted way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Part of the CAP was targeted—it was about work experience. This morning, the Minister tells us that the proposed scheme is targeted and is about work experience. He has taken a successful element out of the national scheme—the community action scheme—and implanted it directly into the pilot project. The project is not about better targeting and getting rid of the bad elements; the good elements have been retained, but for a very small group of people compared with the impact that the CAP had and would have continued to have—that is the difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0632">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The Minister also mentioned the 1–2–1 project. If he claims that research has proved that project more effective than community action, he has not read his Department's research. That research suggests that a positive outcome is achieved by between 27 and 38 per cent. of participants. If the positive outcome from 1–2–1 and related programmes is removed, the figure for finding a job off the course falls to between 4 and 9 per cent. The remainder of the 27 to 38 per cent. are simply transferred from one Government scheme to another. They are passed around the system, but no one gets out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not changed the CAP because of positive research—if the Minister had read the positive research, he would have maintained the programme. He has rejected programmes on which his Department has spent money, yet there has been no dramatic increase in genuine outcomes—people obtaining work in the labour market, either long or short term. The Minister has rejected his Department's advice and he must come clean: the change is no more and no less than a budget cut that has been dressed up as a new initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us what will happen to the labour market in Medway where, according to the Government's statistics, for every job vacancy there are 14 people on the register, so there is a 14 to one chance of an interview, never mind a job? There is a similar ratio for the Hull pilot project area. What initiatives will be taken alongside the pilot project to try to enhance people's chances of maintaining their employment at the end of the project? A 14-to-one chance is not a good ratio for the long-term unemployed. What further measures will be provided, perhaps through the local training and enterprise councils, to try to ensure that at the end of the project people have an opportunity to enter work? I shall give an example of what I suspect will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received the details yesterday of a woman who lives just outside the Kent pilot project area. She has been unemployed for four years and was up for a six-month review. She was referred by the Minister's Department to the training division of SOLOTEC in Bromley. She has insurance service management qualifications and wanted to get back into the insurance industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the Department's request that she take an interview, she was interviewed on 23 April for the post of a personal assistant to a partner of J. Rothschild Assurance Plc, which is a top company in Hyde Park corner. She was interviewed by Diane Beckenham, who represents the TEC, and the job was offered to her on the following basis: she would be given no training, because she already had a suitable qualification for the job; she would be taken on for three months, with no guarantee of work at the end of that period; and she would be paid £10 a week, from which £4 would be deducted towards her travelling expenses. She would therefore be paid £1.20 a day to work a five-day week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the level of opportunity that the Minister's Department is offering to people in the Kent area, a few miles down the road from the pilot project. Is that quality? Is that providing people with genuine opportunities to go into the labour market? The
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Minister's Department and the TEC, far from fulfilling their contract—which receives a considerable sum from the taxpayer—to find people meaningful placements and job opportunities, are involved in out-and-out exploitation. Can he honestly say that £1.20 a day is anything other than that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give the Minister the details of the case later and I request that he investigates it. I imagine that the TEC will claim to the Department that it has had a positive outcome and it will want to be paid for that under its contract. Will the Minister also check whether the TEC has charged and been paid for training? What guidelines does the TEC have about introducing people to such employment practices? Does the Minister think that that is a genuine way for a TEC, working with his Department's officials, to find people placements in the labour market? Will he put in place safeguards for people on the pilot projects so that the same thing does not happen to them? The practice may well be widespread.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently wrote to the Minister with a set of questions about the regulations. Will he be able to give the answers to the Committee this morning, or have they not yet been drafted? I am not challenging him to give me them this morning, but if his officials have drafted answers to the questions about regulations, pilots and young people, it would be helpful to place them on the record. If they are not ready, I shall wait for the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the time comes, will the Minister tell us when the assessment period commences? Will the project be assessed at the end of its lifetime? If so, what mechanisms are available if it is found to be ineffective? I am not being negative, and I hope that the projects will be effective. If they are not, however, what additional measures can be taken to ensure better access to training and job opportunities for people in the projects?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The projects will run from now until the middle of 1997, and we shall introduce appropriate mechanisms to monitor and evaluate them throughout. At the end of that period, we shall—as we always do—conduct an in-depth evaluation of the projects' effectiveness to assess whether our approach should be continued, broadened and widened. The findings will inform the continuing decisions that the Department has to make about the programmes' structure and nature. The idea is to establish whether the principles that are built into our approach are valuable, help individuals or have weaknesses. Our findings will be used to inform further policy developments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is implied in the programme that there is no commitment to giving participants new skills. Will the Minister confirm that there is no absolute agreement? Does he agree that a minimum level of recognised training qualifications should be agreed on by the person who goes on the course, and those who organise it? At the end of the course, it should be possible to assess the training so that it might form part of possible further training for a national vocational qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the course offer the incentive of access to the labour market and to genuine training? One of the greatest problems for the long-term unemployed is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0633">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
unemployability because of a lack of skill. If the programme does not address that, we shall end up back at square one, and many of the problems of unemployability will remain. Will the programme have an impact on training levels? There seems to be no commitment in the programme to skills training and skills content.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government do not think that it is right to include an absolute requirement for a mandatory or arbitrary training element, although I accept the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument. Often, although not exclusively, skill deficiency causes long-term unemployment. I know, however, of people with highly developed skills who have been out of work for some time, but are still unable to find work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall seek a mix of approaches in the proposals that are made by providers, some of whom will build training into their programmes, while others might not. When we consider that mix in our assessment, we shall want to determine whether the skills training element is as advantageous as the hon. Gentleman suggested. We shall not be arbitrary about such training, and I should expect it to play a part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are getting somewhere. The Minister is right that there are people with skills who are still available in the labour market. Will the mix of providers mean that an unemployed person—in the Medway area or Hull—can say that he wants part of the course to be training so he cannot be placed with a certain provider whose contract does not include a training element? The individual must be able to have some say about content.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it will work that way. We are talking about individual claimants who have been in contact with the Employment Service for a long time, who may be well known and may have built up a rapport with the relevant officer. I am sure that there will be an element of dialogue, but the claimant cannot be allowed to lay down conditions about what type of programme is acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to help the unemployed to find work. It is in our interest to do so because we want to demonstrate our success in reducing unemployment. In the end, however, this will not be a matter for negotiation. It will be a matter for our expert officers in the Employment Service using their judgment about what will best help the individual and directing claimants to the most appropriate programme. As I said, however, I expect that the process will involve a reasonable element of dialogue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is open about people being placed with an appropriate provider. Individuals will have no choice—on a one-to-one basis in their job clubs or whatever—and have no genuine say about their project placement. The potential maximisation of support for the schemes can happen only if they are meeting the needs of the people involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has effectively admitted that this is a draconian measure—"Here is a provider; here is a course; you are on the course, whether or not it suits you." That is bad for the individuals affected and for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
taxpayer. It is a waste of taxpayers' money when we should be maximising the benefits from their input of financial resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the very least we should ensure that individuals are put in appropriate placements—not just any placement because a contract is involved. Otherwise, we are wasting taxpayers' money and the time of unemployed people. The provision throws into disrepute the quality and effectiveness of the scheme. The Minister should consider the provision more seriously. Contracts have not yet been set. I understand that the programme is to commence on 8 April, but will the Minister confirm that? Are people already being placed or are they still awaiting placement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer that question directly. As we are only in the early stages of the first 13 weeks of the process, we are nowhere near the second phase—the point at which providers will come in—which is intended for July. In the next few days, though, we shall be considering the tenders and contracts. We are not quite there so we do not know exactly what provisions will be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may not be such a big difference between us. My point is that the Employment Service must retain the final say on what individuals will be expected to do. There is a mandatory element—it has to be thus. I should be surprised, however, if Employment Service officers did not want to take reasonable account of individuals' wishes, strengths and weaknesses in deciding on a placement. As the hon. Gentleman rightly says, that would bring a better chance of success. I want to retain a final say for the Employment Service. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman wants to give individuals an automatic veto but, as I said, I doubt whether there is too much between us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter not of giving a veto to an individual, but of partnership. There must be sense of commitment on both sides if the schemes are to work. There must be a sense of partnership, and people in a vulnerable position must not be pushed hither and thither. It is a pilot scheme, so those involved should consider whether ideas work. Given the need for motivation, it seems reasonable to try to ensure that there are contractual arrangements for a client group of 6,000 to 9,000, some of whom will require training. We should ensure those people take part in a programme and that the programme is effective; no more and no less. Will the Minister ensure that that is achieved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the first 13 weeks people will be given the maximum, intensive help. If, during that time, a significant training element were identified, the training-for-work option would be made available. So a training element is built into the procedures. We shall examine the bids that we receive from providers and assess their strengths and weaknesses. One of the things that we shall be looking for is a training element. So I do not think that there is a great difference of view. I am not opposed to a training element. I am only saying that it must be given a reasoonable place and not be given too much prominence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right. I do not think that I will get much more out of the Minister, so I thank him for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0634">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Will the Minister tell us who has sought to provide contractual arrangements? Are they from the voluntary sector or the private sector, or is it a mix? Are they national providers or localised providers? What type of provider has participated in the bidding procedure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this stage, I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an answer. That is because I do not have that information. I am not sure that I will have it—unless I am about to be given it now, but I doubt it. That procedure usually occurs at local level; it does not require ministerial involvement—that might reassure the hon. Gentleman. I am, therefore, not aware of the businesses and undertakings involved, nor of their nature and distribution. That information will be in the public domain fairly soon, but as we speak I do not have it. But there is something on its way to me—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] It tells me that we expect to finalise providers in the next two weeks. A note tells me that there will be a mix of voluntary, private and education sectors and that the final details are still subject to commercial confidentiality—the good old saving clause that always makes me feel good when I have to say it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is as much as I can tell the hon. Gentleman. We have nothing to hide; there is nothing particularly mysterious. It is just that we have not reached the final stage in the process. But the providers will be known in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be extremely brief because my hon. Friend has covered many of the crucial points relating to pilot schemes. We are worried that the pilot projects may lead to fragmentation of the benefits system. Will the Minister reassure us that, apart from these regulations, there is no intention to change benefit rates as a consequence of setting up such pilot projects?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 29(5) of the Jobseekers Act 1995 contains powers to extend and renew pilot projects, but the statutory instrument specifies that these regulations will cease to have effect on 4 July 1997. The presumption is that if, under the 1995 Act, the Government extend the pilot projects, new regulations will have to be laid to enable us to monitor and scrutinise what has happened up to July 1997 and to have a fresh debate on the particular provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Roger Evans)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is yes. If these powers are exercised, further regulations will be laid before the House and hon. Members will have another opportunity for debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's reassurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise a couple of specific matters relating to good cause. Regulation 5 of the jobseekers allowance pilot scheme refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the circumstances listed in regulation 73 of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations"</p></blockquote>
governing good cause. Regulation 6 of the income support pilot scheme lists in more detail the circumstances in which good cause can be applied, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
regulation 6(2) stipulates that one reason for good cause would be if the project put the person or
	<br><blockquote><p>"his health or safety seriously at risk".</p></blockquote>
My understanding, however, is that regulation 73(2) (a)(ii) of the jobseekers allowance regulations specifies circumstances in which attendance
	<br><blockquote><p>"would have put at risk his health".</p></blockquote>
Does the provision in the income support regulations, which refers to health and safety, also apply to the provisions under regulation 6, which should therefore read
	<br><blockquote><p>"his health and safety in all cases"?</p></blockquote>
Is the matter covered elsewhere in the regulations? Will the Minister confirm that the income support regulations flow through all the regulations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations make it possible to bring in reasons for good cause which are not specified, but I am surprised that neither racial nor sexual harassment is specified in the regulations. Will the Minister assure the Committee that the claimant has the right to appeal in all situations to a social security appeals tribunal about good cause decisions, both in terms of circumstances that are specified in the order and other unspecified circumstances?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the regulations will run only for a limited period—until July—it is crucial that their progress is monitored. We want to ensure that they will apply fairly and consistently to income support claimants in project areas and elsewhere. I look forward to the Minister's response to my two specific questions and to any more general remarks that he might make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the hon. Gentleman's questions about the purpose of regulation 6 in the income support measure and regulation 5 in the jobseekers measure. The jobseekers allowance regulations spell out the provisions in modern form and in greater detail. The intention is that, for the purposes of income support, the regulations before the Committee would contain parallel stipulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's fundamental point concerned the right of appeal. Decisions are independently adjudicated and can be appealed against. The argument in an appeal can either concern the correct interpretation of specific items that have been listed, or it can be about the general provision. Experience shows that draftsmen and Parliament cannot predict or specify every conceivable example of good cause. Although we should try to give a general but detailed list where we can, there is a safety provision, whereby a matter could be worked out on appeal by a social security appeals tribunal. General legal provisions relating to sex or race discrimination are always in force. Such circumstances would be breaches and would, on the face of it, be good cause. It is not necessary to spell out breaches of other legal provisions because that would follow as a matter of course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have answered the hon. Gentleman's specific questions, but I shall give way to him if he wants to ask a further question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's response, but I am not clear whether his answer was based on drafting errors or the fact that the provisions
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
cannot be exhaustive. Will the Minister make it absolutely clear, first, that the provisions of the income support regulations flow through all the regulations, so that health and safety regulations will apply to them all? Secondly, although provisions concerning racial and sexual harassment are not written into the regulations, will he confirm the implication from other legislation that people can invoke such circumstances as good cause so as not to continue with a particular project? I think that is what the Minister said, but I would be grateful for his reassurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not talking about drafting error. The best way to put things is that there is a matter of drafting policy, and there are a number of different ways of cutting the cake. One does not normally bother to spell out specifically what is clearly enacted elsewhere. That is why it is not necessary to refer to sexual and racial harassment, for example; they would obviously be good cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the point of view of drafting policy, we have considered and received representations most recently—indeed, there has been much discussion in Committees in which the hon. Gentleman and I have participated—as to the best modern way to draft regulations. We take the view that the JSA regulations themselves are drafted in the best modern way. We have provided for the fact that the pilots run during the six-month period in which income support is still a relevant provision. The details do not need to be in the JSA order because it cross-refers to regulation 76, but it was necessary to spell them out in the income support regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is an infelicity regarding the hon. Gentleman's point on health and safety, I suggest that in practice, safety would be good cause under one heading or another. The hon. Gentleman looks as though he wants me to give way again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to labour the point, but the Minister seems to be saying that the best way to draft the provisions is under the jobseekers regulations, which refer only to health. He then talked about the best modern drafting. As the income support regulations are more modern than the original jobseekers regulations, surely the best way would be the most modern way, which specifies health and safety. Which way round is it? Is "health" the normal form, which includes safety, or should "health and safety" always apply in future, since they are the words in the newer income support regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is now crossing words with me. The point at stake is that the jobseekers regulations are the most modern form. The income support regulations are subsequent in a sense, but they have a short lifespan and are designed to operate between now and October.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Keep talking, there is a note coming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard that sedentary observation. My point is simple: both concerns are addressed in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been greatly helped. The health and safety question in the JSA pilot regulations is carried forward into the JSA amending regulations, which were laid on 28 March but which have not yet been debated. The point has been spotted; it is in the pipeline and in due course will come before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why did the Minister not say that in the first place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member's asides are very entertaining, but I think he knows that they are out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Hogg.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have now dealt with the specific social security issues that the hon. Member for Withington raised.
