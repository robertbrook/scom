	<div class='title'>Draft Driving Licences (Community Driving Licences) Regulations 1996</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Transport in London (Mr. Steve Norris)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Driving Licences (Community Driving Licences) Regulations 1996.</p></q>
These regulations are part of the legislative process of implementing the second European Community driving licence directive, which was adopted by member states in 1991. They amend primary legislation—principally the Road Traffic Act 1988 and the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988—to bring some of the provisions of the directive into force from 1 January 1997. The regulations cover Great Britain only; Northern Ireland has its own legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Implementation requires changes also to secondary legislation. The Government announced on 25 April that those changes would be introduced in two stages. Theory testing will be introduced for car and motor cycle driving tests from 1 July 1996. The remaining changes—theory testing for driving tests for other vehicles, additional driving tests to gain entitlement to drive certain vehicles such as minibuses and small goods vehicles, the treatment of existing licence holders who already have those entitlements, and changes to eyesight requirements for lorry and bus drivers—will take effect from 1 January 1997. The latter changes will be presented to the House of Commons for approval in the autumn, following public consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall put the requirements of the directive in context. The second directive takes forward the process of harmonisation of arrangements for driver licensing and testing initiated by the first driving licence directive of 1980. That directive introduced the concept of mutual recognition of driving licences, which was intended to facilitate the free movement of people throughout the Community. It was underpinned by minimum health and testing standards to ensure road safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Member states were required to issue licences in a common format, with entitlements based on common vehicle categories. Member states could nevertheless continue with their national categories if different. The common format made checking driving entitlements throughout the Community considerably easier. Licences were to be mutually recognised for drivers who took up residence in another member state. However, because harmonisation was only partial, drivers were required after one year to exchange their licences for one issued in the new country of residence—but without having to pass another driving test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
For many years, we and other member states issued driving licences on a similar basis. The second directive takes that process further. It consolidates the concept of the mutual recognition of licences by removing the obligation on drivers who take up residence in another member state to exchange their licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive applies to EU member states and those other states within the European economic area—the EEA—namely Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. I shall outline the key provisions of the regulations as they will affect new residents with licences from EEA states. For convenience, I shall refer to those licence holders as Community licence holders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 9 of schedule 1 gives all Community licence holders the same right to drive here as holders of equivalent British licences. It also makes their licences valid for the same period as an equivalent British licence—unless they expire earlier under the rules of the country of issue. Such licence holders will, in any case, exchange their licences on expiry, or when renewals are required under our medical rules; if, under certain circumstances, they suffer driving disqualifications, they will have to comply with those rules here. Nothing will stop a Community licence holder who has taken up residence here exchanging his or her licence for a British one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 11, 12 and 20 to 28 of schedule 1 bring resident Community licence holders within the same medical and conduct regimes as apply to British licence holders. For example, licence holders entitled to drive lorries or buses will need a medical examination at the age of 45, every five years thereafter until the age of 65, and every year thereafter; and those drivers' entitlements may be suspended, or they may be disqualified, if their conduct makes them unfit to hold such a licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Effective enforcement of the medical and conduct regimes depends on the details of the drivers being available to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority. The DVLA already has details of all British licence holders. Community licence holders for goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes or for passenger-carrying vehicles with nine or more passenger seats who come to live here are therefore required under paragraph 10 of schedule 1 to register their details with the DVLA within one year of taking up residence. Other drivers may do so if they wish, but will not be required to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Registered drivers will receive a counterpart to the licence, like the document that already accompanies a British licence. Registration and the issue of a counterpart will aid the recording of endorsements against Community licence holders, but it will also bring benefits to drivers. It will be much easier for drivers to replace a lost or stolen licence; they will have access to the fixed penalty regime which, among other things, makes it unnecessary to attend court for each offence; and the DVLA will be able to contact them about licence renewals and send them information about driving in the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs 2(2) and (3) of schedule 1 will require an applicant for a licence to be normally resident, that is, to have lived here for at least six months in a year. That applies to anyone applying for a first licence, anyone wanting to upgrade an existing licence to include
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0437">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
additional entitlements and anyone who wishes to exchange licences. Hon. Members may recall press reports some months ago about driving licence tourism, when it was alleged that some disqualified German drivers were coming here to obtain a British licence. I stress that the provisions will make that type of operation much less likely. The second directive stipulates that a person may not hold a licence from more than one member state. Under paragraph 6(2) anyone with a Community licence will have to surrender it if he wishes to obtain a British one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 2 incorporates amendments to the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 to bring Community licence holders within the scope of penalties associated with the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations also extend to Community licence holders certain entitlements that currently are available only if a British licence is held. Those include, in schedules 3 and 4, the right to be licensed to drive taxis or private hire vehicles, or to drive small buses for charitable and similar purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, therefore, the changes that the regulations introduce will enable new residents from other member states to drive on the same footing, with similar entitlements and subject to similar constraints, as those who hold British licences. Importantly, British licence holders will of course have commensurate benefits when they take up residence in another member state. The Government's view is that the regulations fulfil the aims of the directive to promote free movement of people throughout the European Union on the basis of parity of treatment of drivers, underpinned by common testing and health standards. This is an important landmark in driving licence legislation and, as such, I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.36 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition welcome the general thrust of the regulations, which is to implement Council directive 91/439. They will simplify the procedures for moving between European states and clarify the validity of Community licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of detailed points that I should like to put to the Minister, not least because this may well be the last chance that I shall have to raise such matters with him in a Standing Committee on delegated legislation. It has for me been a helpful process, and I do not mind admitting that I have learnt a great deal from the Minister's experience. It has, I know, been a pain in the neck for him, but none the less, it has been extremely helpful to me, and I wish him well in whatever he does in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations allow for a mandatory exchange of licences for drivers who become resident in Great Britain and who are then subject to a driving disqualification. Will the Minister please reassure me that that will mean that any drivers resident here will be unable to escape such a disqualification, even if they have a Community licence and later choose to return to their country? The Minister will know that this issue has greatly concerned me and I take this opportunity to thank him for having written to me on the international application of driving bans, which has a close bearing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
on the matter being considered this afternoon. I believe that a copy of the letter has been sent to the other members of the previous Committee on which we served, but if there is anyone in this Committee who has not seen it, then with the Minister's permission I am happy to provide a copy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the complications presented by the detail of any such proposal on this issue, but that is all the more reason to redouble our efforts to find a way forward. I was heartened by the Minister's agreement that it is wrong that drivers who commit the most serious road traffic offences in countries that they visit are able to escape the consequences of those offences when they return to their usual country of residence. This matter is so serious that we cannot allow it to become bogged down in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Action on driving bans should not falter because of disagreement over less serious penalty points. Equally, action on disqualifications for serious offences on which all member states are agreed must not falter because of a few offences on which there is no agreement. Action on transferable or equivalent penalties must not wait until agreement has been reached on the possibility of member states increasing the duration of a disqualification. In short, because this issue is so serious, we should not only vigorously pursue a long-term Community solution, but accept that that will take some time and, therefore, investigate the possibility of less comprehensive interim measures. Most importantly, we must ensure that an efficient and all-inclusive system exists for transferring information on bans between the various licensing authorities of the member states. If such a step were taken, I understand from the Minister that we could take unilateral action to ensure that British drivers returning from abroad were not able to escape the consequences of any serious offence that they had committed while away. Where possible, that should be extended to bilateral agreements with other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, on this issue, I should like to ask the Minister what rules apply to a driver from abroad who escapes, say, a one-year United Kingdom ban by returning home, but returns to this country after that year has elapsed. Would it be possible to ensure that the driver was not allowed to drive in the UK again until he had served the full year of that ban—however many visits it took to make up that year—rather than allowing the ban to lapse in his absence? Perhaps the Minister could clarify that in Committee or by writing to members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations raise other concerns about enforcement. I support the general principle of indefinite mutual recognition, but I should like to know how, in practical terms, it will be possible to enforce it. A foreign licence holder driving in this country is clearly subject to UK traffic laws, but could be subject to one of two sets of licence conditions—relating, for example, to the type of vehicle and to standards of health and fitness. If the driver is a visitor, he need comply only with the standards in force in his home country, but if he has taken up residence here, he is subject to the licence conditions explained in the regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
If a foreign driver is stopped by the police for whatever reason, how is the officer to tell which set of rules applies, and whether or not the driver's licence entitles him to drive the vehicle that he is driving? The temptation will surely be to assume that the driver is a visitor. That would allow residents with Community licences effectively to continue using their licence under their home country's rules rather than under ours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if prosecutions are brought, it may be extremely difficult to prove whether the driver is a visitor or has taken up residence. European nationals do not require a visa, which would spell out the difference between residents and visitors. The situation is confusing and is clearly one of the reasons for the move towards standard codes for European driving licences, but that will remove only part of the problem. Will the Minister give us some reassurance on how the matter will work in practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.42 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Chidgey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastleigh)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, have much enjoyed debating with the Minister across the Floor of the House and in Committee, and I shall miss him, not least because he always addresses the argument as well as the personality, which makes a refreshing change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the measure and especially the fact that it will now be possible to prevent drivers from other European countries coming to the United Kingdom as tourists, having been banned in their own country, and getting a licence in Britain with which they can return to their own country. It was important for that loophole to be closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is familiar, I am sure, with the current programme of random checks of drivers by the police, which is called the all-sorts programme. The results have not yet been published, but I understand that significant and worrying information is emerging, particularly in relation to goods vehicle drivers committing offences that would inevitably lead to them being prohibited from driving. When the Minister receives those figures, if he does not already have them, will he check the number of European lorry drivers who come to the UK and are found to be breaking the law in the manner in which they are driving or the vehicle that they are driving, and will he tell us whether the appropriate penalties will be exercised to prevent a recurrence of such offences? That important matter must be addressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.44 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I thank the hon. Members for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) and for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) for their extremely kind remarks. In the general valedictory spirit, may I say how much I have enjoyed their contributions on many occasions? Debate with them has been a thorough pleasure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the disqualification issue, a person who holds a Community licence and is resident in the United Kingdom can have that licence taken away on conviction as easily as can a person holding a United Kingdom licence. However, the hon. Gentleman is right: that does not solve the problem of such a person,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
having been banned from driving in the United Kingdom, choosing to return to his host country and obtaining a licence when he leaves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I prefer to denationalise the issue, as it were, by referring simply to country A and country B within the Community, because it applies to drivers in Germany and Belgium as it would to drivers in Britain and any other European country. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the issue of how we treat drivers who have committed serious offences in one member state and who effectively walk scot free—especially if they are visitors—is outstanding, urgent and needs to be tackled. I wrote to the hon. Gentleman—as I promised to do—on progress to date on that matter, but there is a great deal still to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All member states recognise that the problem will remain until we have harmonised penalty and traffic law—I am sure that some of my hon. Friends would question whether we need common traffic law from Perth to Piraeus. In Greece, drivers can lose their licences for killing a goat, but that offence is not common in magistrates' courts in most counties of England and Wales. We would need commonality of penalty before we could introduce a regime that allowed us to transfer penalties. So I suspect that the issue will run for some time, but I agree with the hon. Member for Nottingham, North that it is extremely serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about people who left the United Kingdom with their licence restored to them after having been banned for a year in the United Kingdom, and who returned six months later. They would be driving illegally were they to attempt to drive on Britain's roads. They would be in the same position as any other driver who chose to drive while not in possession of a valid licence. Of course, once the year had expired, they would be perfectly entitled to reapply for their licence and to continue driving. In the meantime, however, there is no question but that they would be driving illegally, and the penalties that might flow from that are those available to the courts—if my memory serves me correctly, they could even serve a term of imprisonment. That penalty would be available to the courts whatever the nationality of the driver concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, North asked about Community licence holders getting by—so to speak—by using a Community driving licence and who do not feel it necessary to convert it, because it is easier to persuade a policeman that they are visitors than to offer a host country licence. I regret that that remains a weakness of the present system. As the hon. Gentleman says, we need agreement on moving towards standardisation before we can tackle that sort of problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of us share the concern of the hon. Member for Eastleigh about other EU national heavy goods vehicle and public service vehicle drivers and heavy goods vehicle drivers generally in the United Kingdom. In part in answer to the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, while registration of car drivers is optional, registration of PSV or HGV drivers—group 2 drivers—is mandatory. That entirely prevents the problem of their advancing a community licence and pretending to be visitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
I think that the hon. Member for Eastleigh knows from his experience that problems occur not so much in dealing with other EU states where, generally speaking, there is a conduct and testing regime for heavy goods vehicle drivers and some attempt, varying from country to country, to put in place proper monitoring programmes. The problem arises in relation to a number of the newly emergent former Soviet Union countries, whose standards are not especially high, whose vehicles are not particularly safe, and whose drivers have all too frequently been driving all day and all night for a couple of days, and arrive here having already broken innumerable drivers' hours regulations.

Incidentally, I do not regard drivers' hours regulations as a piece of bureaucracy; they exist to ensure that tired drivers do not kill—unfortunately, tired drivers will kill, as their concentration will lapse. In this country, we take the matter seriously, as the hon. Member for Eastleigh knows.

We are enjoined not to monitor trucks too close to ports, because we are told that that would be to breach
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
the general community directive that requires us to allow the free movement of peoples. I assure the hon. Gentleman, however, that we monitor very carefully some of the incoming vehicles. The results of that monitoring will inform us what steps we need to take to deal with travellers in the HGV and PSV categories—there are many coaches arriving from eastern Europe that are not exactly satisfactory. The results may also suggest other ways in which our domestic rules may need to be changed.

I hope that that answers the questions asked by the hon. Members for Nottingham, North and for Eastleigh and, on that basis, I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
