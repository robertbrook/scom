	<div class='title'>Draft Food Safety (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1996</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Michael Ancram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Food Safety (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.</p></blockquote>
This is a necessary technical and procedural order, introduced to the House on 30 April 1996, to ensure parity in the Province and Great Britain. The order will amend the Food Safety (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 to provide enabling powers for the Department of Agriculture, to implement by regulation various European Community directives on structural and hygiene standards, inspection and associated controls in premises producing meat and meat products, including poultry meat. The order also includes a number of procedural amendments in relation to enforcement responsibilities on milk. The opportunity is also being taken to make minor amendments to bring the Food Safety (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 more into line with the Food Safety Act 1990 in Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the order draws on the provisions of the Deregulation and Contracting Out (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 relating to the effect of contracting out on Departments and other persons responsible for the provisions of services and the termination of contracting out arrangements and ancillary provisions regarding contracting out authorisations. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Illsley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This technical order amends the Food Safety (Northern Ireland) Order 1991—which, in turn, mirrors the Food Safety Act 1990. We broadly welcome provisions for enhancing food safety. The Department of Agriculture appears to be the enforcing agency. I want to ask the Minister some questions on deregulation and contracting out. He may not be able to provide all the answers this morning, so I would be pleased to accept a written answer. We shall not vote against the Order as it makes necessary amendments to food safety legislation in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One interesting aspect of the order is the existing requirement placed upon the Government to train employees of liquid milk plants and dairy farms—the power of the Secretary of State to instigate training courses. That power is to be removed from the 1991 order by article 6 of today's measure. Why are the Government no longer providing training courses for people engaged in milk production?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Article 46 of the 1991 order is also to be removed. It relates to the power of the Secretary of State to prohibit the importation of any class of food. Amendments to article 17 may retain the powers of the Secretary of State in another form. Will the Minister confirm that the order is not simply removing the Secretary of State's power to ban the importation of certain classes of food from Northern Ireland? Will he give an assurance that other articles will be strengthened to compensate for the removal of article 46?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 26(5) of the 1991 order is amended by article 7 of today's draft order. It allowed a district council environmental health officer who had been appointed under the Local Government Act 1972 relating to Northern Ireland to be an authorised officer for the purposes of the 1991 food safety order. That proviso will be removed, and local government will no longer play any part in that order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have often debated the democratic deficit in Northern Ireland local government in the House, and we know that local government there has few powers. The order goes further towards removing its powers, and it removes the right of district council environmental health officers to act as food safety enforcement officers. I suggest, however, that they are the best people to undertake the enforcement of food safety and are likely to be the best qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason that paragraph (5) is to be removed becomes clear if we further consider the order, and particularly the deregulation of contracting-out provisions in article 7. Article 7 allows for articles 13 to 15 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out (Northern Ireland) Order 1996, which has already passed through the House, to apply to the draft order. Local councils will be excluded from enforcing food safety, and the Government can contract out their powers under the two orders. The Department is removing all qualified environmental health officers from that area of food safety and taking the power to appoint "any person" to look after food safety. The draft order says that any person can be appointed to take on a council's role. What safeguards will exist for that aspect of deregulation and contracting out? I stress again that district council environmental health officers in Northern Ireland are probably best qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in danger of lessening, rather than increasing, food safety by introducing the deregulatory powers in the order. Only last week, people involved in meat processing were prosecuted because they had breached regulations on specified offals. I have acted in constituency cases, in which abattoir regulations have been overcome by corrupt veterinary surgeons who have given certificates in respect of casualty-damaged animals. Those are obviously topical issues, and we are in danger of mistakenly deregulating that aspect of food safety and enforcement. I hope that the Minister will give some assurances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say a few words about bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Northern Ireland, which was mentioned when the draft order was debated in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
other place. The Opposition believe, and have said before, that the controls now in place for beef in this country are sufficient for the European and worldwide ban to be lifted. The effect of BSE on the Northern Ireland beef industry is devastating. The industry is a large part of the Northern Ireland economy and agricultural industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that the deregulation of food safety in 1989 perhaps led to the present BSE crisis. We allowed cattle feed regulations to be changed then, and should be careful that we are not deregulating too much now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Dr. Strang), the Opposition spokesperson on agriculture, and I have met with the Ulster Farmers Union. We do not agree with it that Northern Ireland beef should have separate status, but we are sympathetic to arguments for a system of accreditation for individual herds throughout the United Kingdom. The system of traceability in Northern Ireland should be replicated throughout the United Kingdom. I urge the Government once again to redouble their efforts to get the ban lifted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although milk processing in Northern Ireland is not directly related, there is a reference to the fact that the order will remove liquid milk production and dairy farms training. I want to press the Government on that, because the Opposition are being pressed by milk producers in Northern Ireland about the 20 per cent. increase in milk prices since the reorganisation and deregulation of the milk marketing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
United Dairy Farmers currently control something like 70 per cent of raw milk supplies from farms, which is a bigger proportion than Milk Marque control in the rest of Great Britain and perhaps a bigger proportion than it controlled before deregulation. It appears that deregulation has led to a statutory regulated monopoly being replaced by an unregulated monopoly. Moreover, United Dairy Farmers retains its own processing company, known as Dromona Quality Foods. United therefore has control over milk supplies and can subsidise the milk processing firm over which it has control. There is an obivous lack of competition. Although the milk is sold by secret auction, Dromona Quality Foods is guaranteed its supply of milk regardless of the price. The result is a 20 per cent price increase—3p to 4p per litre of milk—which is having a devastating effect on milk producers in the Province. They want to see Dromona Quality Foods split off from United Dairy Farmers and some control over the contracts that are offered by United to milk suppliers. They currently run at 12 months on a rolling contract, whereas other milk producers can offer contracts only up to three months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have caused quite enough problems for Northern Ireland's beef and milk industries through deregulation and the food safety orders. They should concentrate their efforts on improving food safety rather than deregulating further. There is a danger that we might cause more problems in enforcement as a result of the removal of the powers of environmental health officers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
	<p>10.43 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been said that we should not allow a technical order to pass without some comment. I listened to the remarks of the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley) and I wondered what had happened to the view that used to be taken by the Labour party when it complained about international companies controlling large segments of production and industrial capacity, usually in Great Britain. It now seems to be saying that it is all right to sell them off and have competition. The view of this party on competition and monopolies is well known. Would the Opposition be happier with the control of large segments of Northern Ireland's food production—even larger segments than is currently the case—passing into the control of companies that are based elsewhere in the EEC and beyond, or do they want to see Northern Ireland's control of many of those companies maintained? In the Ulster Unionist party's view, far too much of Northern Ireland's food processing capacity already belongs to companies whose headquarters are outside Northern Ireland and, indeed, outside the United Kingdom. I do not think that any member of the Committee should be happy about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with wry amusement to the Minister when he said that the order would bring us into line with the rest of Great Britain a year or two later. Why are these matters not dealt with on a United Kingdom basis since we are all working within the ambit of the Common Market? Why should Northern Ireland be denied the benefits of any changes and placed in a position of disadvantage? Will the Minister give an assurance that the order will mean a tightening and raising of standards throughout the United Kingdom rather than a weakening of the high standards that have thus far prevailed in Northern Ireland, which depends so much on the food industry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4 refers to "novel foods", which I assume to mean genetically altered foods, synthetic milks and heaven knows what else. I should like to know more about the intention behind the changes. Does the provision cover only synthetic foods and genetically altered foods, such as tomatoes and tomato puree which we often see on the supermarket shelves, or does it go further? What about new types of vegetable and products from the food supplement industry? What about diet aid supplements? Common Market regulations about them have caused heartbreak and sorrow to some hon. Members. We should be told much more about what is covered by the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5's two or three lines propose considerable changes. The Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture currently has responsibility for food production at the primary level—meaning dairy farms and slaughterhouses, for example. What will be the consequence of proposed changes? There seems to be a shift from councils to the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture, or is it the other way round? As with the Northern Ireland (Entry to Negotiations etc.) Act 1996, one has to read back
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
through the principal legislation and heaven knows what else to understand exactly what the changes signify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 also poses questions about the role and powers of Northern Ireland public health officers. How will the order affect their work? They provide a very high standard of inspection and hygiene with regard to all food premises. Indeed, I suspect that standards may be higher than in the rest of Great Britain. Allegations about standards in slaughterhouses in connection with BSE, the use of derivatives of slaughtered animals and cross-infection have been bandied about on the Floor of the House over the past few weeks. They should give everyone cause for concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister for Agriculture said that standards had to be tightened up further, it showed that the 1988 regulations had not been complied with in slaughterhouses. In Northern Ireland, however, I suspect that those regulations were thoroughly monitored and enforced. We must know more about the impact of the provisions on the Northern Ireland public health officers' role, which has been so positive in respect of slaughterhouses, and on the role of Department officials in dealing with premises owned by councils as well as slaughterhouses in Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 deals with food hygiene training, but it is always prefaced by that little word "may"—it "may provide", not "shall provide". Will the Minister tell the Committee what food hygiene training is provided by councils in Northern Ireland? Is it formalised, is it by means of advice to the various organisations with premises in which food is prepared up to the point at which it is handed over to the consumer, or is it by some other method? There has been a change of face in the dairy milk production sector, so we need a fuller explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to article 10, the whole question of BSE raises its ugly head once more. I am unhappy about any deregulation in this field, given the difficulties that we have experienced in recent weeks. If this work is contracted out to an agency or to a private firm, I fear that the Minister will say yet again that it is nothing to do with him and that he does not have to answer on the Floor of the House—at least not until he is pushed very hard. He will argue that he is responsible for it only second or third hand. Given the horrors that we have seen in the meat industry and the concern among the general public about food hygiene and the safety of British food, the Government should be more careful than some of their actions imply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The section on saving and repeals contains a long list. The Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, on which I have the honour to sit, is often concerned about such practices. Time after time a long string of changes is made by subordinate legislation and that leads to a revamping of the primary legislation and the principal orders. Consequently, ordinary citizens are lost when they try to sort out the law to find out what buildings it applies to and what they can and cannot do. I suggest that we need a complete reprint to bring
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
the order up to date. In future, it would be simpler to keep us totally in line with Great Britain by automatically applying the changes made to Great Britain legislation to Northern Ireland without having to go through this procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.52 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will deal with the hon. Gentleman's last point briefly. The fact that this order brings Northern Ireland regulations into line with those in the rest of the United Kingdom is to be welcomed. That did not happen originally, because at one time the view in Northern Ireland was that legislative controls would provide a two-tier meat inspection whereby the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland would have responsibility for premises from which meat and meat products were sent out in Northern Ireland and the Department for Health and Social Security would legislate for district control of premises that were connected solely with the supply of meat and meat products to the local market in Northern Ireland. On reflection, and following consultation, the view was taken that that was not the right way to proceed, so the order was introduced to regulate the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall later come on to some of the more detailed points that the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) raised. I shall first deal with one or two points raised by the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley). He kindly invited me to write to him if I did not have full answers. I shall write to him on milk processing, which is not strictly speaking dealt with by this order. He raised some important points, which I shall refer to my noble Friend Lady Denton, who is the Minister responsible. I shall ask her to provide him with a reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about food hygiene training. Sub-paragraph (a) of article 6 amends article 22(1) of the principal order to require the Department of Agriculture to provide food hygiene training for persons who are or intend to be involved in food businesses. It removes the original sub-paragraph, which ceases to have effect because the power has been transferred under the article as amended. However, the power remains, so I can assure the hon. Gentleman his fears on that point are not well founded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was worried about the arrangements in article 4 for prohibiting the importation of certain foods. These regulations would transfer from the Secretary of State to the Department of Health and Social Services or the Department of Agriculture responsibility for making regulations to prohibit the importation of specified foods. That is necessary because the purpose of any action to ban such imports under the Food Safety (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 would be to protect public health and prevent disease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) will understand, that is a transfered matter under the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973. It also brings the Food Safety (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 into line with other legislation, and ensures the constitutional requirements are met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central asked about article 7 and was worried that contracting out would remove accountability. I can tell him that article 7 ensures that the Department or other person remains accountable and legally liable for the exercise of the function, and that the function shall be treated for all purposes as having been done—or omitted to be done—by the Department or other person. So the liability remains in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Illsley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that accountability will be retained: I was worried about the qualification and fitness of the person receiving the contracted-out responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a point that relates to any form of contracting out. It is more a political point than a real one. Where the accountibility remains is the important thing, as that is where the control exists.

The hon. Gentleman asked about the removal of the environmental health officers' enforcement powers. We are not taking away the right of environmental health officers to enforce the appropriate food safety regulations. The Order merely clarifies the position of EHOs so that they can be employed by a council on a group basis. The current regulations do not permit that.

The hon. Gentleman asked a general question about deregulation. This order contains provisions for deregulation and contracting out because the Department of Health in Northern Ireland does not have the power to employ staff on contract. Without the amendment, the Department of Health would be the only Government Department with responsibility for food matters which could not employ staff on contract. Effectively, this is a technical matter to keep the DHS in Northern Ireland in step with the rest of the United Kingdom. In fact, there are no special plans to use that power, but it is right that there should be equivalence.

The hon. Gentleman also asked about BSE. Strictly, that matter is not covered by the order, but I appreciate the anxiety behind the hon. Gentleman's remarks. We are all worried about the effects of BSE, especially in Northern Ireland, where many jobs depend on the beef industry. The European Union export ban is having a more severe impact there than in the rest of Great Britain because of the Province's greater reliance on exports. I assure the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Gentleman that my Government colleagues are exercising all their powers to secure the progressive ending of the export ban. We shall not shirk our responsibilities in that regard, and we shall pursue them with all available energy.

The hon. Member for East Londonderry referred to registration of food premises. Article 5 extends to the Department of Agriculture, where appropriate, the powers to register food premises which are currently available to district councils. That is the article's only effect, so I think that the hon. Gentleman's fears are not well founded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 10 provides for the Department of Agriculture to register licensed premises used for the sterilisation of meat which is unfit—or is not intended for or is prohibited from sale for—human consumption. It also prohibits the use for that purpose of any non-registered premises, as well as prohibiting the use for that purpose of any premises except in accordance with the licence conditions. The hon. Member for East Londonderry seemed to be worried that a relaxation of the rules was being proposed, whereas the order will in fact ensure that the situation will remain under the control of the Department of Agriculture.

The hon. Gentleman asked about novel foods. Novel foods are foods that have not previously been used, or have been used to only a limited extent, for human consumption in Northern Ireland. The term embraces genetically modified foods. The provision makes no change to the level of or arrangements for control, which remain the same as for the rest of the United Kingdom. The order allows the change to be made to DANI's power. If the hon. Gentleman wants more specific information about the precise groups that might come under that description, I do not have it to hand but will arrange to let him have it. I am sure that he appreciates that I am dealing this morning with a subject that does not fall directly under the responsibility for which I speak in the House of Commons and that he will accept my writing to him. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
