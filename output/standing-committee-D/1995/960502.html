	<div class='legislation'>Draft Proceeds of Crime (Northern Ireland) Order 1996</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Sir John Wheeler)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Proceeds of Crime (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.</p></blockquote>
The Order was laid before the House on 16 April. It will update and restate the law relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other serious crimes. It will replicate changes in the law already introduced in England and Wales by the Criminal Justice Act 1993 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1995, bringing Northern Ireland broadly into line with the rest of the United Kingdom. The order will also introduce additional powers, which are not generally available in other parts of the United Kingdom, into the investigation of the proceeds of crime, including drug trafficking and other racketeering activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order contains powerful measures which aim to make it more difficult for convicted drug traffickers and other criminals to profit from their crimes. There is a strong moral imperative that crime should not pay, and the measures contained in the order will send a clear message that we intend to ensure that it does not pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal for a draft order was published in December 1995 and distributed to a wide range of individuals and organisations for consultation. Those who responded generally welcomed the proposed measures. However, there are some amendments. Since publication of the proposal, the Government have taken the opportunity to make a number of small amendments to the draft order, which I shall deal with now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we have decided to broaden the scope of the additional investigation powers in article 49 of the draft order to include offences under part III of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989. That covers a point that arose during debate on the Emergency Provisions Bill, which the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) will remember. The additional powers of investigation will be available for investigation into the proceeds of all indictable offences, including those under part III of the PTA. We have also made consequential amendments to articles 50 and 51 which cover other investigation powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we have amended article 50(5) so that a financial investigator, as well as a constable, will be able to apply to a judge for an order allowing access
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
to premises where material subject to a production order is held. Article 50(1) already allows the financial investigator to apply for such an order for material relevant to an inquiry to be produced to a constable. The amendment does not affect the execution of any orders, which will continue to be a matter for the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, a parity measure will include in schedule 1, which lists the high lucrative offences in respect of which a court of summary jurisdiction may make a confiscation order, a number of counterfeiting and copyright infringement offences which have recently been added to the equivalent list for England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we have made it clear that the order should come into operation on 25 August 1996 to ensure that it commences at the same time as the repeal of the current Emergency Provisions Act. That is important because the order contains additional investigation powers which will replace provisions currently in the EPA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the detailed provisions of the draft order and will keep my comments as brief as possible. In the main the provisions either re-enact provisions already in force in the Criminal Justice (Confiscation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1990, or they replicate measures that are already in operation in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major changes and additions made by the draft order are to oblige courts to confiscate the proceeds of offences where that is requested by the prosecution and to oblige courts to assume that all property in the possession of a convicted drug trafficker, and property which has passed through his hands in the last six years, represents the proceeds of drug trafficking. The draft order will also abolish the £10,000 threshold—which is applicable only in respect of offences other than drug trafficking—below which a confiscation order cannot be made; and, where a person has been convicted of at least two qualifying offences, it will give the court the discretion to make the statutory assumptions about the origins of the defendant's property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order will ensure that a convicted criminal can no longer satisfy a confiscation order by opting to serve a prison sentence in default of payment of the amount due. It will also give the court the power to reconsider making a confiscation order in a case where it did not previously do so, or to revise its original assessment of an offender's proceeds of criminal conduct, within six years of a conviction. The draft order will give the court the power to make a confiscation order against the estate of a convicted criminal who has died or against a defendant who has absconded, and it will extend to general criminal conduct the investigative powers currently applicable only in drug trafficking cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order also provides for additional powers of investigation which are not generally available elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Article 49 gives the court the power to appoint a financial investigator to assist the police in specific inquiries where it is considered that the investigation could be more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
effectively carried out with the involvement of specialist assistance. Those powers are set out in schedule 2 to the order. I shall explain why the Government believe that such powers are necessary in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the racketeering in Northern Ireland is carried out by terrorist organisations or by persons linked to them. It involves armed robberies, drug dealing, extortion, protection rackets, counterfeit goods and money and other criminal activity. Against that background, it is clear that unless resolute action is taken crime of that nature will remain a problem. The Royal Ulster Constabulary faces a racketeering problem which is clearly different in nature and extent to that which exists elsewhere in the UK and I commend it on the successes that it has had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EPA, as members of the Committee will know, contains additional powers of investigation—the authorised investigator provisions—in relation to the finances of terrorism. To assist the RUC in tackling racketeering in Northern Ireland, the order includes similar additional powers of investigation in relation to the proceeds of crime, whether or not it is connected to terrorism. The provisions will replace and, in Northern Ireland, will in practice cover everything that could have been covered under the EPA provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three matters I should like to draw to the Committee's attention. First, although the order relates to investigations into whether any person has benefited from crime, the legal definition of "person" is wide enough to include any organisation. Secondly, the RUC will be able to apply for the appointment of an investigator at an early stage of its enquiries—there will be no need for it to wait until someone is convicted. Thirdly, the new powers will be available in relation to the investigation of the proceeds of criminal conduct that take place before the order comes into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, the order represents a considerable strengthening of the law, which is necessary to combat the menace posed by drug trafficking and other crimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the provisions are comparable with changes that the Government have implemented in England and Wales, or restate provisions in existing legislation. The additional measures, which are not generally available elsewhere in the United Kingdom, are specifically designed to tackle problems of racketeering unique to Northern Ireland. Our intention is to provide practitioners with one coherent body of legislation dealing with those complex matters. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.40 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We broadly welcome the order, which, as the Minister said, replicates, with a few exceptions, legislation in England and Wales that is largely acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the order for two reasons. To use Lord Colville's expression, which the Minister will
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
recognise, the previous situation was a legislative shambles, drawing on Prevention of Terrorism Acts, Emergency Provisions Acts, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 and others. A general tidying-up was needed. We have supported for some years the principle, approved by the Standing Advisory Committee on Human Rights, that the powers in question should be contained in the main body of anti-criminal law rather than in emergency legislation. To that extent, we have no problems with the measure's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree with the central principle of the measures, which is that people should not profit from crime. A particular attitude has developed among the criminal fraternity towards the wages of crime; to earn a certain amount of money, it may sometimes be necessary to undergo the occupational hazard of spending time in prison. That should not be regarded as merely the downside of crime. If people have profited from crime, the money should be returned to the people from whom it was stolen. I suspect that few attitudes annoy the public as much as the idea that, after doing some time in prison, criminals should be able to enjoy a life style paid for by a life of crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly pointed out the particular context of terrorism in Northern Ireland. We are dealing not simply with orthodox racketeering, but racketeering linked with paramilitary organisations. Today's debate is well timed, because Ronnie Flanagan, deputy chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, spoke yesterday to the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs on the same subject. The headline resulting from that sitting was that £1 from every ecstasy tablet sold in Northern Ireland could be going to the coffers of loyalist paramilitary groups. He said that the IRA was involved more indirectly than loyalist groups in drugs, preferring to license others rather than operate syndicates itself. However, the IRA has moved into the rave scene, according to Deputy Chief Constable Flanagan, and is providing drugs instead of alcohol at some of its clubs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paramilitary organisations on both sides of the divide use racketeering to raise funds. We need not think that, even if there is a ceasefire, the process will stop, because people will want to maintain themselves in the style to which they have become accustomed. There is a great danger that although the level of recorded crime in Northern Ireland is greater than in Great Britain—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Maginnis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is lower.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for, as always, being alert—he betrays his past history in the security services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the level of crime is lower in Northern Ireland, there is a great danger that that relative benefit might be eroded by people associated with paramilitary organisations transferring their activities to orthodox crime. The other aspect that we need to consider is that it is not just the criminality involved but the fact that the activities of terrorists or criminal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
gangs have a serious impact on legitimate businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the legislation is that in the United Kingdom we have traditionally put the burden of proof on the prosecuting agencies. The order reverses the burden of proof so that people will have to prove that they do not have ill-gotten gains. We are introducing civil court standards of proof that base a judgment on the balance of probabilities, instead of criminal court standards of proof which use the concept of beyond reasonable doubt. The balance of probabilities will be used to decide whether a person's life style and income is derived from criminal activities rather than law-abiding activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important issue, against which we have to weigh the huge importance of the laundering of criminal proceeds into orthodox financial activities. The Minister will remember that some years ago, we went to the United States as members of the Select Committee on Home Affairs where we received severe warnings about the consequences of large-scale racketeering on the integrity of the banking system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister give more detail on the amendments that were made in putting the EPA in this order and say why that occurred? I did not get the impression from him that there were any difficulties. He reassured us about the word "person" meaning also an organisation. That is fairly orthodox interpretation of the word. There is, however, a difficulty with the concept of corporate guilt as opposed to individual guilt, which leads to problems in enforcing the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see any problem with the RUC being able to appoint an investigator at an early stage. That is common sense. In so far as retrospective powers are ever justifiable, I understood the Minister to say that where investigations had started, the extra powers available under this legislation could be applied to those investigations and court cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have a problem with those points but perhaps the Minister could clarify them. In addition, will the Minister say a little more about the augmentation of powers in the legislation relating to England and Wales?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the changes that has taken place in recent years was the abolition of a limit in the order. Previously, in drug cases, powers of confiscation related only to proceeds of more than £10,000. As I understand it, the order extends those powers to any proceeds of crime, which is already the law in England and Wales. Has the Minister any information about how that is operating? Are the police and the courts confiscating much smaller sums now, and how is that working? Referring to article 10, the explanatory document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Article 10 re-enacts and amends Article 6 of the 1990 Order. The court currently has discretion in the case of a drug trafficking offence, to apply the rebuttable assumptions about the origins of a defendant's property. This Article now obliges the court to make these assumptions."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister explain what that means? What are the rebuttable assumptions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Articles 41 and 43 relate to the enforcement of orders made outside Northern Ireland. It infuriates the public that, with the free passage of labour within the European Union, and as crime is international, people derive income from crime or terrorism in this country but then go and reside abroad—in tabloid terms, the most common choice is somewhere in Spain. Does the order enable British courts to remove people's property that is in Spain or elsewhere? Is it possible to achieve smooth international co-operation in that respect? Do the necessary powers exist within the European Union?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to my final point, which is probably the most significant, both to Great Britain and Northern Ireland and also to Europe—the human rights aspect of the legislation. The Minister will be aware that there is a problem with this law as far as the European Court of human rights is concerned. We are a signatory to the convention, which reaffirms the principle that everyone is innocent until proven guilty according to law. There is one case, currently in our High Court, that might go to the European Court, in which a person called Dameed Khan, who was found guilty at Guildford Crown court of importing heroin, is seeking to challenge the court's right to confiscate in that way. The case has been listed by the Court of Appeal criminal division
	<br><blockquote><p>"as a test case in recognition of the fact that hundreds of similar cases depend on the outcome … There is no dispute that convicted criminals should be made to hand over the proceeds of their crimes. No reasonable person would challenge that. However, the presumption of innocence is fundamental to any democratic society. The powers"—</p></blockquote>
those contained in the draft order—
	<br><blockquote><p>"allow a judge to over-ride that basic principle."</p></blockquote>
I am not taking sides—this is a difficult issue—but I should be interested in hearing the Minister's views on that case, what he expects the consequences to be, and what the British Government's response will be if the case goes to the European Court of Human Rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.55 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister for not arriving in time to hear his opening remarks. Like him, I have the bad habit of trying to pack 75 minutes into an hour. It does not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every honest citizen in Northern Ireland will welcome the draft order's provisions. That the order is to be incorporated in normal law, as distinct from emergency legislation, is especially pleasing. As we slowly move towards less terrorism, we shall be faced, more and more, with the knock-on effects of 25 years of criminality emanating from a small, but well-organised, element of Northern Irish society. It is important to recognise the criminal structures attaching to terrorism and to understand that they will not automatically disappear should terrorism become less rampant or disappear entirely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past 25 years, organisations that are obviously criminal in nature have adopted a facade of respectability. Ill-gotten gains have been ploughed into apparently legitimate organisations, but the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
undercurrent of criminality persists. The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie alluded to the evidence taken yesterday by the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs from officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in respect of drugs. That form of criminality creates a large pool of illegal money. It is important that it should be possible to investigate, not only individuals, but organisations as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may have already alluded to the matter, but I am grateful to him for having taken on board in the order some of the issues that we raised when debating the emergency provisions legislation. I shall not go into detail, as I am sure that the Minister has already spoken about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the remarks made by the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie about the scope and extent of the legislation. I should like the Minister to deal not just with the issue of what happens when money is taken to Spain or other far off parts, but with what happens to money that is banked in Liverpool, Manchester or London. What impact would the provision have on the ability of investigating officers to pursue money that was held in institutions in Great Britain?

I have no difficulty—and nor, I believe, will most people—with the matter of burden of proof of innocence. Those of us who consider ourselves to be respectable, law-abiding citizens have long endured the Inland Revenue's interest in our affairs, and the burden of proof has rested with each of us in respect of how we account for our money. I do not imagine that that troubles Members of Parliament to any great degree, but perhaps we can take comfort from the words of the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath); perhaps we shall in future have more concerns of that kind. If the burden of proof in Inland Revenue matters rests with law-abiding citizens, obviously people who are involved in criminality cannot be exempted from that approach.

I welcome the measure, and I am grateful to the Minister for the way in which he has consulted Northern Ireland Members about the matter, and taken into account the issues that we have raised with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to reply to the debate and I welcome the support for the measure from the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie. As he rightly observed, the need for the powers in the order so that people shall not profit from crime, is widely recognised by the public and in all parts of the House. The hon. Gentleman referred to the "shambles" of the law as it stands. I hope that the order will bring the law relating to Northern Ireland together in one clear organ that will enable practitioners to improve their command of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie was right to refer to the evidence that I understand was given by the deputy Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to the Northern Ireland Select Committee about the impact of terrorist orchestrated
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
crime in Northern Ireland. That is a real, serious problem. Certainly, the so-called loyalist gangs have a direct impact in relation to drug dealing and trafficking, while the Provisional IRA masks its involvement in a different way. It takes its cut, although it may not deal directly in the product. The measure will help the authorities to deal with that serious problem. I welcome the hon. Gentleman's support for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised several other issues, which I shall tackle as briefly as I can. He asked whether it was appropriate and acceptable for the standard of proof to move from the onus in criminal hearings to the balance of probability in civil actions. There is some confusion. The Government do not intend to change the standard of proof in determining guilt for a criminal offence. The criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt will remain. A conviction for a criminal offence will be made in the same way as it is now. It has always been our intention, however, that the standard of proof for confiscation procedures should rest on the civil balance of probabilities. Therefore, an appropriate and important division exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 10(2) outlines assumptions, which are that
	<br><blockquote><p>"any property appearing to the Court … to have been transferred"—</p></blockquote>
to the defendant—
	<br><blockquote><p>"at any time since the beginning of the period of 6 years ending when the proceedings instituted against him, was received by him, at the earliest time when he appears to the Court to have held it, as a payment or reward in connection with drug trafficking carried on by him … any expenditure of his since the beginning of that period was met out of payments received by him in connection with drug trafficking … for the purpose of valuing any property received or assumed to have been received by him at any time … he received the property free of any other interests in it".</p></blockquote>
It is intended that such property and proceeds will be covered by the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether the powers applied to overseas properties and assets. That is an immensely complicated subject, and I am not equipped to explain it today. It goes beyond the confines of the order. However, the hon. Gentleman is right to raise the matter because it is relevant to dealing with the apparatus of serious and organised crime, whether it originates from terrorist racketeering or international drug dealers. Action on assets and property that are located in other countries depends on a series of bilateral and other agreements in the context of the European Union or other treaties, on agreements between Governments, or on the compatibility of legal systems. The matter is complicated, and I cannot give a simple, straightforward answer. However, a range of mechanisms is available to law enforcement agencies. For examples, Interpol has an increasing impact on the problem. Police agencies of the European division of Interpol, as well as those of the world, increasingly work together to exchange intelligence and deal with the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
define a relationship for tackling the problem. Those who speak for the Government of the Irish Republic constantly articulate good intentions. They are not unaware of the problems relating to the proceeds of crime. Has there been any sign of the tangible preparation of means whereby co-operation could take place between the Governments of the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom on this local crime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. It is right for him to ask about the relationship of the powers in the order with the Republic of Ireland which, as the Committee may know, suffers from a serious plague of drug trafficking and drug-related crime and therefore, has a strong mutual interest in working with the United Kingdom. The Republic's legislation on the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other crime is contained in its Criminal Justice Act 1994. I understand that the powers in that Act are broadly similar to those available in England and Wales, which are contained in this draft order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore have every reason to believe that the two jurisdictions have compatible legal bases to work from. There is a strong desire for a high degree of co-operation between the different authorities—whether police or Customs and Excise—on both sides of the border. The United Kingdom is keen to negotiate a bilateral agreement with the Republic for mutual enforcement of restraint and confiscation orders. I am hopeful that that can be achieved soon. The hon. Gentleman's urgings in that respect will, I am sure, be listened to in Dublin with much interest and enthusiasm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) urging the need for cross-border institutions. I am sure that he will raise that in strand two of the talks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a liberal interpretation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a joy for 10 June. The Minister talked about the European Union and cooperation in Interpol. What I am really after is not investigation by the police, but cross-court and cross-Government laws to bring about effective action. Are the Government pursuing that within Europe? Are they enthusiastically urging the European Union to have cross-Union measures on this matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman as always. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Indeed, it is always a pleasure to respond to his charming and modest interventions. I really must defend the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. I do not think that he had cross-border institutions in mind. It was a much more straightforward and practical notion—that of good, willing co-operation between
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
police agencies and criminal jurisdictions, which want to deal with villainy wherever it may arise because it is wrong to the citizens of the two countries in question. Work is ongoing to improve those arrangements and I am sure that the Committee will welcome it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie asked whether the Government are involved in negotiation within Europe. I suppose that the straightforward answer is yes. We are always involved in negotiation on such issues. The negotiations are hugely complicated because we are dealing with different criminal jurisdictions and different approaches to court procedures and law enforcement. Conventions exist—the 1988 United Nations convention on drugs and the 1990 Council of Europe confiscation convention are continuing attempts by sovereign countries to suppress organised crime and, in particular, drug trafficking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether equivalent legislation on the confiscation of assets in England and Wales is working. The Home Office is responsible for that, but it is too early for clear advice. The Criminal Justice Act 1993 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1995 are still recent and analysis of information collected has not yet enabled a clear answer to the hon. Gentleman's questions to be reached. When it does, we may know whether Parliament should consider improving the law. We shall learn from the research evidence and will make judgments on the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the proposed powers of a financial investigator. Those are greater than the powers of existing authorised investigators. Financial investigators will have powers to gain information from banks and can disclose information to Government Departments outside the United Kingdom, such as Revenue and Customs departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the Khan case. That is not a Northern Ireland case, so I have no knowledge of it. I am afraid I cannot help him on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone for his long interest in today's subject. He has constantly advocated improvement of the law to make it apply to terrorist gangs and organised crime in Northern Ireland. I hope that the order fulfills his expectations and know that he will continue to monitor the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
