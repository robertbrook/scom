	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Malcolm Moss)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Road Traffic Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.</p></blockquote>
The draft order provides a revision of Northern Ireland's road traffic law as it relates to prosecution and punishment for road traffic offences. Its provisions are modelled on those currently in force in Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order has three main parts. Part II makes provision for the trial of road traffic offenders, and deals with proceedings, evidence and the production of documents in court. Part III provides for sentencing of offenders, endorsement of driving licences and disqualification. In particular, it introduces a penalty points system. Under that system, motoring offences would be separated into endorsable and non-endorsable offences. Endorsable offences would carry penalty points which would be endorsed on the counterpart of a driver's licence. If 12 or more points were accumulated within a three-year period, the driver would be disqualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system is aimed at rendering any person who repeatedly commits endorsable road traffic offences liable to a period of disqualification. That would be the most significant new feature of the revised law. The proposed order also specifies offences that would carry obligatory disqualification in their own right, and those where a court would have discretion to disqualify. Other important features of part III include a new extended driving test following conviction for certain serious road traffic offences, and an experiment in the use of courses for drink drivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part IV deals with the fixed penalty procedures. It introduces dual-level fixed penalties. The present fixed penalty of £20 would continue for non-endorsable offences, and a second level of £40 would be introduced for endorsable offences. Those amounts are based on those currently in place in Great Britain and would be subject to review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Five offences are created by the order. Those deal with failure to produce driving licences and certain information in court, false statements and the unauthorised removal of fixed penalty notices from vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order was circulated to 162 individuals and bodies, and about 30 responses were received. Overall those indicate a general acceptance of and a welcome for the order's provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
The draft order follows the 1995 order by reviewing the prosecution and penalty provisions applicable to road traffic offenders. It is believed that its proposals will make a further valuable contribution to road safety and to achieving our target of a one-third reduction in road casualties. I commend the draft order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.33 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Dowd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Sir James.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be brief. There is nothing in the draft order to which we take exception. As the Minister says, it is largely a catching-up process—a process to which Northern Ireland legislation seems especially prone. The orginal changes in Great Britain legislation date back as far as 1988 and were amended in 1992, so Northern Ireland is now four years behind. I am surprised that the Northern Ireland Office does not take a more original approach, not only in respect of the draft order, but in respect of the delays that are often encountered when harmonising Northern Ireland legislation with Great Britain. Northern Ireland could be used more effectively to test developments in particular fields and to see whether those could be improved in advance of becoming law in Great Britain. I shall return to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The title makes it clear that the order has to do only with offences and the treatment of offenders. As such, no new traffic offences have been created, other than minor ones related to non-payment of fines. The order is essentially about the administration of the process, rather than about matters relating to road traffic and safety, except for the introduction of speed cameras, as they are popularly called—I am not sure what the technical expression in the order is—and the admissibility of photographic evidence. Even my thin grasp of the subject suggests that a camera is necessary to produce photographic evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the introduction of drink-driving courses for those convicted and willing to undergo them, the extended driving tests following disqualification and the introduction of penalty points, which the Minister mentioned. I am not sure how far behind GB legislation we are in Northern Ireland. To my certain knowledge, penalty points have been in existence in the United Kingdom since 1984 when I received my one and only speeding fine and three points. I hasten to add that that is my only motoring offence, apart from the odd parking ticket, to which motorists in London are prone. We welcome all those developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the changes to the penalty points system, and the subsequent abolition of parts of the 1981 legislation, will offenders be liable to the new penalty on the date when the offence was committed or on the date of conviction at court, assuming that they go to court? I understand that there could be an overlap between the two. In other words, the order could come into force after the offence was committed but before the offender was brought before the court. I should be grateful for clarification of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
On the question of speed cameras, there are reports of a pilot project on the A1 between Sprucefield and Newry being undertaken by the RUC. Will the Minister tell the Committee how that project is progressing and whether he has received any indication of the other locations where speed cameras might be installed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I mentioned earlier that we could, perhaps, be more innovative with Northern Ireland legislation, given the delay in its introduction compared within the rest of the United Kingdom, I was thinking of the fixed-penalty system that has been introduced and of developments with regard to parking tickets in particular, although I know that they are not covered by this measure. Certainly, in the rest of the UK, parking tickets now include an incentive scheme whereby early payment qualifies for a discount. The evidence from the local authorities that have responsibility for the scheme indicates that it has prompted some offenders to pay so that they do not need to be taken to court. If that is applicable to parking fines, I cannot see why it should not be applicable to fixed penalties issued for moving traffic offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to spend a few moments considering the cost and staffing implications. Will the Minister assure the Committee that the full costs of both the drink-drive courses that have been mentioned and the extended driving tests will be borne by offenders, and that there will be no impact on the public purse?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part 3 of the explanatory document that accompanies the order says that two additional staff will be required at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency but makes no mention of the additional staff required as a result of the increased activity of the court service. However, it does show that when the system is established, it will have initial costs of £1.2 million and annual running costs of £600,000 thereafter, against an estimated annual income of £3.2 million. That means that the Department will make £2 million in the first year and £2.6 million in every subsequent year. Some people might regard that as a nice little earner. Certainly, it would justify the institution of the system. However, depending on whether the penalties are £40 or £20, it shows that anywhere between 80,000 and 160,000 new offences would be committed every year. I wonder what will happen to the people who commit those offences. I assume they are being committed now without punishment. I cannot imagine that people's behaviour would change such that they would want only to stoke the Department's coffers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to financial and staffing implications, a major omission is the cost of installing speed/traffic light cameras. Perhaps that matter is not the responsibility of the Minister's Department. How will the relevant costs be met and who will be responsible for maintaining the facilities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All road traffic and associated legislation is primarily about safety. Safety is especially appropriate in Northern Ireland, which has the worst record for accidents and for general road safety standards in the United Kingdom. That matter has been researched
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
recently. After our consideration of the previous order in October 1995, the Minister wrote to my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) confirming that the Transport Research Laboratory had been commissioned to undertake comparative analysis and that it would report at the end of 1995. Its report has been available for some time. What action does the Minister propose to take in light of the report's conclusions and recommendations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister confirmed in response to a written question of mine that the number of road safety education officers in Northern Ireland would be cut, despite the fact that the Traffic Research Laboratory report praised their work highly. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The relatively better casualty record for children of school age (eg 10–14 year olds) reflect more effective road safety education practice in Northern Ireland…. This probably reflects the Province's unique policy of deploying road safety education officers in Area Education Boards rather than Highways Departments as is usually the case in Great Britain."</p></blockquote>
It is a shame that the Minister sees fit to cut the number of road safety education officers, for whom there is widespread regard throughout Northern Ireland. There is clear evidence that they play a significant role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report also states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Another problem of road safety in Northern Ireland that has been indicated by the statistical analysis is the level of drink/driving, which appears to be significantly higher than on the mainland. The RUC breath tests far fewer accident-involved drivers than do the British forces. Experience shows that increasing the test rate to match the British average should help to reduce the level of drink/driving significantly."</p></blockquote>
We all understand that there are competing and conflicting pressures on the RUC, but the report makes a significant point. The chief constable of the RUC said that enforcing road safety and road traffic leglislation has, for reasons that we all understand, taken second place to other duties. Will the RUC be able to make appropriate progress? Does it have the resources to police and to enforce the order effectively?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.44 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the order, which will go a long way towards improving Northern Ireland's sad record of road deaths, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would encourage better driving standards if we forced drivers to face up to their responsibilities because the penalty for any misdemeanour will be recorded on the driving licence. The penalty point system is welcome because it treats all drivers equally, regardless of their social position. It will create fewer inconsistencies in sentencing and every case will be dealt with on its merits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the explanatory document and the order, I was struck by the justifiable emphasis that was placed on the penalty points system for traffic offences in Northern Ireland. I noticed the abolition of the limited disqualification, which was contained in the 1991 order and which would be incompatible with the new system. We have also seen the introduction of courses for drink-drivers. It is a voluntary scheme for which the offender has to meet the costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
Item J in the summary of key provisions mentions the admissibility of photographic evidence for speeding offences or failure to comply with traffic lights. It will be interesting to see what will happen in Northern Ireland about that, since I have been driving there for a number of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a large and very heavy order that contains many articles and paragraphs. It has been presented to the Committee without any possibility of changing it. The Minister may say that we had the opportunity to make comments during the consultative period. I did receive a letter during that period and I broadly welcomed the order. However, there should be some means of amending such documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some provisions tucked away in the order may have far-reaching effects on special drivers. One nugget is contained in article 8, which deals with jurisdiction in prosecution for offences under articles 56 and 81(1) of the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1981. Those relate to drivers' hours and are applicable to Community rules—the European, not the Northern Ireland, Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I went to the Library to look up the 1981 order. I have the relevant sections with me and I can confirm that article 56 refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"Limitations of Continuous Hours of Duty of Drivers of Goods Vehicles",</p></blockquote>
and article 81 to
	<br><blockquote><p>"Offences against applicable Community (European) Rules".</p></blockquote>
I must admit to the Committee that I missed those articles when I sent in my comments on the consultative document. However, others subsequently drew them to my attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Northern Ireland, there are about 1,800 owner-drivers of goods vehicles. Some 100 of those drivers, in response to the problems that they face, recently formed the appropriately named Northern Ireland Owner Drivers Association. The association's chairman expressed much anxiety about article 8, and I also received communications from local district councils on the same subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 8 will reduce the amount of time that such drivers can work. It is very difficult to get work nowadays, and owner-drivers must look around for employment. A driver in Enniskillen who gets a job drawing sand or rubbish or something on the Shankill Road or the Falls Road must travel a considerable number of miles to Belfast. That mileage will be taken out of the quota that that driver is allowed in a day's work, with the result that he will have to return home early or break the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be especially unfortunate for owner-drivers. Firms who employ drivers may be in a different position. Many owner-drivers have to do a bit of overtime or extra work to make a reasonable living wage for themselves and their families. I was interested in article 56(5)(a) of the 1981 order. Will the Minister say whether the Northern Ireland Office would be able to relax the order? I know that that article refers to fire engines and other vehicles, but does it cover the problem that I have described?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
Will the order apply to foreign drivers coming into Northern Ireland? I assume that it is consistent with European Community rules. Will it apply to Republic of Ireland drivers? They also belong to the European Community. They drive from the Republic to ply for trade in Northern Ireland, and then return to the Republic. Will the order apply to them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that article 8 will also bring into operation the so-called grandfather rights regarding eye tests. Community rules mean that lorry drivers who wear spectacles have to be able, when they take their glasses off, to see a certain distance—I understand it to be 3 metres—and to read a certain size of letter. I might be wrong about that. Perhaps the Minister could tell us whether article 8 covers the issue and whether drivers in Northern Ireland will be in the same situation, or whether the matter is for Great Britain legislation which covers Northern Ireland. As we have a Road Traffic Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order, I can only assume that legislation which covers Great Britain will not cover Northern Ireland. I shall be interested to hear from the Minister whether the article covers the matter. If it does—and the Minister might hope that it does not—perhaps he could also explain the details. I know that owner-drivers and others in a similar situation would be most interested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all support the enforcement of legislation which is designed to protect the public from unroadworthy vehicles, but is it fair that the legislation might seem to penalise properly licensed drivers who appear, quite rightly, to be under continuous pressure from the Department of the Environment's enforcement branch? I do not think that anyone would object to that pressure, but there are cowboy drivers who are not licensed in Northern Ireland. They also use the roads and can take on jobs. It appears that when such cowboy drivers are taken to court, they are given a reasonably small fine and return to the roads quite quickly afterwards. Whereas properly licensed drivers—regulated drivers—are well known, the other types of driver are not so well known and appear to be getting away with more than are properly licensed drivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would certainly be in everybody's interests were licensed operators encouraged to keep to high standards and cowboys actively discouraged from operating on our roads. It has been suggested that if cowboy drivers are caught too many times, they should forfeit their vehicle. That might be a rather drastic step, but that is some people's opinion—they think that if we want to keep the roads safe, such action should be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context, can the Minister tell me what training is given to enforcement officers in Northern Ireland in dealing with the general public, especially those who come under the enforcement regulations? And is there a code of conduct or a code of practice for enforcement officers as there seems to be in every other Government Department?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the issue of checking the weights on each axle during discussion of another order. The issue arises because of another European Community regulation. At the behest of the European Community,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0506">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
loads and lorries are much heavier now so the weight on each axle is important. There are certainly not enough weighbridges in Northern Ireland to check each wheel. Many sand and coal companies do not have weighbridges to check the weight on each axle. In certain circumstances, if those people who are not breaking the law are stopped and have to go to a weighbridge that is miles away, a lot of time is wasted and production is lost. I want to know how many weighbridges in Northern Ireland are capable of doing that, because it is a specialised operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I refer to article 23 and the cameras used to detect speeding. Will the Minister tell the Commiteee—I know that he has already been asked this question, but I shall repeat it in the context of motorways—whether such cameras have been installed on any of the motorways or whether they will be installed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate my support for the order, which brings Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom, albeit after a long time. I shall pay close attention to the Minister's replies to the various questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.01 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd) raised the issue of the delay in progressing Northern Ireland legislation. That matter was raised when we considered the 1995 order, and I accept that there has been some delay in bringing this order before the Committee. There were a number of reasons for that, not least of which was the need to mirror the developments in the law in Great Britain. We were close to finalising this matter, but before we could proceed with our amendments to the current Northern Ireland order, we had to wait for the 1991 order to go through, because it contained some additional provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finance was also a factor—I shall not dismiss that. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the figure of £1.2 million, which we envisage will be required to set up the court service to monitor the penalty points system. That money will come from my Department. The two Government Departments had to liaise with each other and in the end it was decided that, because of the impact of the order on road safety, the money should come from the Department of the Environment, although the system will be administered by the court service. That money was allocated after the latest public expenditure survey round, so we are now proceeding with the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke of differences that could arise as a result of introducing leglisation in Northern Ireland after it had been introduced in Great Britain. Our primary purpose is to rationalise Northern Ireland legislation and to bring it into line with legislation in Great Britain. But there are nuances and differences. The hon. Member for South Antrim (Mr. Forsythe) made that point when he asked why such orders were not capable of being amended. Most of the time we are merely replicating GB law and applying it to Northern Ireland, but there are nuances and it is sometimes not appropriate merely to tack Northern
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Ireland legislation on to Great Britain law, because that can create severe difficulties and make it impractical to draft the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to point out two differences in this order. The wording of article 41, which deals with disqualification until the test has been passed, differs slightly. We believe that the variation is necessary to enable Northern Ireland to continue to require convicted drink drivers to retake an ordinary driving test—that requirement is particular to Northern Ireland. Article 76 gives power to the Lord Chancellor to make regulations in respect of enforcement of unpaid fixed penalties that have been registered as fines. We believe that that is necessary to take account of local arrangements and the means by which penalties in criminal matters are enforced in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to speed cameras, which are defined in the order as a "prescribed device". Presumably that covers all types of camera that may or may not be installed. I was asked whether speed cameras work. A trial was done in west London between 1991 and 1993 during which the number of fatal and serious accidents dropped by more than a third. We are therefore keen to implement the policy in Northern Ireland as quickly as possible because we believe that it will lead to a substantial reduction in road traffic accidents and fatalities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dowd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I did not make myself clear. I was in no doubt that speed cameras worked—all the evidence over here shows that—but my information was that a pilot project was being considered for the Al in Northern Ireland</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes it is. The pilot project has not yet commenced because it is illegal to instal speed cameras until the order has been approved. We believe that the RUC and the road service have earmarked the A1, as the hon Gentleman said, and trials should begin on it as soon as possible. We have already made some changes on the A1, because we deem it to be one of our more dangerous roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The installation of cameras will be an operational matter for the RUC. I understand that a number of options are being considered by the police, including the use of permanent and mobile signing as appropriate. Again, the A1 has been chosen for the pilot project. The funding of cameras for the detection of speeding and traffic light offences has yet to be finalised. Obviously, their location is a police matter but we are holding discussions with the RUC about the funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lewisham, West asked when penalty points were first introduced, but I cannot answer that. He obviously had a speeding fine before I did, back in 1984. I understand that the legislation was incorporated in road traffic legislation in 1988, although it may have been in force some years before that. The hon. Gentleman also asked when the penalty point system would come into operation in Northern Ireland. That will be determined by the date of the offence, where it is committed after the order has come
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
into operation. The order is similar to GB law and, as I understand it, there is no discount scheme in either GB law or the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lewisham, West asked about the cost of the drink-driver courses and of the extended driving tests, a subject that was also raised by the hon. Member for South Antrim. Yes, the people who go on the courses will have to sign up to them. In answer to a further question from the hon. Member for South Antrim, the courses are voluntary and people will sign up to paying the full fees, as they would on the driving test courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Antrim also mentioned the Transport Research Laboratory's report on Northern Ireland's road accident record and how it relates to other areas of the United Kingdom. He wanted to know what we have already done as a result of that report and what we are prepared to do to implement some of its findings and bring about an improvement in the Province's road safety record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are strengthening the legislation, first by means of the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1995, which reviewed and strengthened the road safety provisions, and secondly—and more importantly—by today's order, which deals with the penalties for offences. We launched two hard-hitting road safety publicity campaigns on speeding and drink-driving, and we intend to extend that to target seat belt wearing. The Transport Research Laboratory found that the number of people who used seat belts was much lower than that for the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The RUC now breath tests all drivers who are involved in fatal or injury accidents and it has also increased the enforcement of wearing seat belts. The Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland is currently examining the reasons for the relatively high rates of admissions to acute hospitals there. That exercise covers all admissions, not merely those to accident and emergency departments due to road accidents. Further research is to be carried out into the higher level of accidents that is reported in Northern Ireland. We feel that the higher incidence of reporting and admissions to hospitals is a feature of the litigious Northern Irish, who go to court for compensation under all sorts of pretexts. If one turns up at the hospital with a cut finger, it has at least been registered as an injury that was sustained in a car accident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On road safety officers, we have reduced staffing levels by a small amount—the hon. Member for Lewisham, West rightly noted that it is a reduction, not an increase. The Northern Ireland system is different from that in Great Britain because our officers advise and help teachers who instruct children on road safety. We would not have reduced the number of officers if we had felt that that would have affected the delivery of the service. I recognise the service's importance and concur with the Transport Research Laboratory's findings. I shall, therefore, carefully examine staffing levels for the coming years
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
and might instigate a report on the matter to ensure that the provision of important road safety education and information is at the required level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his remarks. I have received representations from schoolteachers about this matter. They are keen that children should be properly taught, but are taken aback because the Department's decision undermines their good work. I am pleased that the Minister will reconsider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am happy to confirm that. The issue has to be seen in the context of the Government's overall spending on road safety provision, which is increasing year on year. Last year, the total was about £14.6 million, and we expect it to increase to about £15 million in the coming financial year. It is possible to spend money not just on Departments' direct running costs and manpower. We have therefore diverted some spending towards practical changes, which are having as big an impact on road safety as operating through our road safety officers alone would have had. We have increased some of our spending in areas that do not involve increased staffing levels. Overall, however, there has been a reduction in fatalities and serious accidents in Northern Ireland. Up until yesterday, the figures were below those for the same time last year and well below those for 1994. There is no evidence as yet that the reduction has fed through to increased fatalities and accidents. The matter is, however, obviously important and needs careful monitoring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dowd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reduction in traffic accident figures is uniform throughout the United Kingdom and is linked to other issues such as highway maintenance and vehicle safety. It is therefore natural and welcome. Is the Minister saying, however, that the reduction in Northern Ireland as between last year and this is comparable to that in the rest of the United Kingdom, or is there still a worrying difference between the two?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not what I am saying. I agree that there is still a difference between the statistics for Northern Ireland and those for England, Scotland and Wales—Northern Ireland is higher on almost every count. We have set ourselves the target of a 30 per cent. reduction by 2000, and had reduced the figure by 29 per cent. by last year. We are therefore almost on target well before the target date. There is, of course, no room for complacency. We are trying to understand and explain why the figures are higher for Northern Ireland, and there is no simple answer. We are, however, doing everything that we can and are increasing our spending on road safety measures to ensure that we reach and exceed our target in the next few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final question that the hon. Member for Lewisham, West asked concerned the RUC. I reiterate that the RUC now breath-tests all drivers in accidents that involve fatalities or injuries. It will also increase enforcement for the wearing of seat belts. Perhaps as a result of the so-called ceasefire, the police have been able to concentrate more on such common-or-garden issues than they did hitherto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1995-1996V008P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
I turn now to the issues that were raised by the hon. Member for South Antrim. I have answered his question about speed cameras. He asked why so-called cowboy drivers got away with low fines and unlawful behaviour. I should reiterate that the enforcement of traffic law is a police matter, except when lorries and commercial vehicles are involved. All drivers who are caught breaking road worthiness, axle weight or driving hours regulations are prosecuted, although it is for the courts to set the penalties for such offences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order sets out offences and the penalties for them, so it is quite possible to ensure by order that offences are properly dealt with. The courts could then carry out Parliament's will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. The offences that appear in the order will be dealt with in the way that we are discussing, although the hon. Gentleman has referred to other offences, which lie outside the order—in particular, to axle weights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked why limited disqualification provisions—under which a court could limit disqualification to the vehicle in which an offence was committed—had not been retained. They would not be compatible with points procedures because one could accrue penalty points in several vehicles and take a considerable time to reach the magic 12 and disqualification. The introduction of penalty points means that we must concentrate on the one vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked several questions about article 8—on drivers' hours—and about articles 59 and 81 of the 1981 order. A court may deal with an offence in the place where it first came to the attention of the police. We are talking here about the drivers' hours code or the European Community rules on drivers' hours. Article 8 simply carries forward an existing provision from the 1981 order and does not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
reduce drivers' hours. If I have not covered all the hon. Gentleman's concerns, I shall consider the matter carefully and write to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with attendance on courses, which is voluntary. Those involved will have to pay the full course fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about weight and axle checking. I do not know how many weighbridges we have in Northern Ireland and shall write to the hon. Gentleman when I have found out. The level of Department of the Environment enforcement is increasing and we have maintained our enforcement strategy at a high level. The detection of offences between April 1995 and January 1996 increased by one per cent. over the same period in 1994–95.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have answered most of hon. Members' questions, but if I have overlooked any, I shall write to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Minister, but there is a matter of a code of practice and a code of conduct for enforcement officers. I support the idea of a code, but want to know whether such a thing exists. Perhaps the Minister can write to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dowd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was just one point, although I should be happy for the Minister to write to me. I mentioned the calculation for the offences that would be required to generate the £3.2 million in projected income under the fixed penalties provisions. I asked whether new or existing offences were going unpunished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to write to the hon. Gentleman about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
