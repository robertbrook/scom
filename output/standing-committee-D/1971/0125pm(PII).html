	<p>[	<i>Continued from col. 984</i>]</p>
	<p>10.35 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. George Thomas) was, as usual, saved by the bell. I was about to tell him that had the country had the misfortune to have a different sort of Government last time Hereford would have had thrust upon it a unitary authority with the whole of Worcestershire, and not a two-tier authority with part of Worcestershire, which the Government are proposing. That is a perfectly fair point to make to the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that I am on my feet, there is another point that I should like to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. In an intervention the hon. Member should not take too many points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we shall have the pleasure of hearing the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) out of order. The good citizens of the county of Hereford elect their Member of Parliament to fight for their interests, and I am sure that his colleagues would not hold it against him if he sought to catch the Chairman's eye. The Minister of State for Wales was right to remind me that he fought the last election with the reorganisation of local government very much in mind. From a letter in the 	<i>Hereford Times</i> I see that his constituents remember what he said in his election manifesto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be interested to hear from this letter, which is signed "Herefordian". I quote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One very important point I would like to bring to the attention of the electorate is in the second paragraph of Mr. David Gibson-Watt's election manifesto".</p></blockquote>
We all know we give priority to the most important things. The second paragraph of the election manifesto reads:
	<span class='label label-info column'>987</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"'We need to keep Hereford as an entity in any reorganisation of Local Government'.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Well, he can't say he doesn't agree with that for it stands in black and white. I hope he isn't going to adopt the attitude of some other politicians whose manifestos were charades of pious hopes and broken promises.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I say to Mr. Gibson-Watt: fish your manifesto from among the mass of papers in the back of your desk, blow the dust off it and read it again".</p></blockquote>
The letter goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We voted for the promises in that manifesto".</p></blockquote>
I sympathise with the people of Hereford. It is true that their Member cannot give the same amount of time to Hereford because he is looking after the interests of Wales full-time. I acknowledge that the Minister has a full-time job carving up the map of Wales, creating problems in the Principality and causing great anger, as the Committee is about to discover—once we have passed St. David's Day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having heard my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis), tell the Committee without challenge that the parish councils, the urban councils, the town councils, the city councils and the county councils are unanimously opposed to the Government's proposals and want to keep their historic county and have a population 40,000 greater than the new county that he is creating next door, I tell him that it is very near a betrayal of trust of people in the County of Hereford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister of State for Wales and Member for Hereford will realise that even his friends in the County Landowners' Association—a body that usually puts the fear of the Lord into me, but not, I have no doubt, into him—have said that it expressed
	<br><blockquote><p>"wholehearted support for Herefordshire County Council in its opposition to amalgamation with Worcestershire."</p></blockquote>
What will be the result if the Government proposals go through? Will the entity of Hereford be preserved? Not at all. It will be a minor part of the new authority. Its next-door neighbours will have a majority of 3 to 1 and will be able to tell the people of Hereford what is good for them. The Minister of State knows that that is what will result from his proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister raised his voice loud and long against the unitary proposals. He appears to be for the people of Hereford, with a suggestion—I put it no more than that—that a Conservative Government would have kept the County of Hereford strong and independent, as it has been in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>988</span>
the past. The truth is that under the Government's proposals the County of Hereford will be a subordinate in the new main authority. If I know anything, the people of Hereford will remember who did it to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that you invite me to speak again, Sir Stephen, because I have heard nothing new during the right hon. Member's eloquent contribution—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the election manifesto?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman knows—for all his brilliant oratorical talent—how to make a vacuum and end up with a vacuum twenty minutes later, although I have to say that the vacuum would rise as the additional hot air is pumped into it. The right hon. Gentleman knows as well as I do that under the proposals in this Bill there are two tiers of authorities. The people of Hereford will look forward to the deliberations of the Boundary Commission and the final recommendations of the Secretary of State to Parliament in order to see what powerful authority will be created in Hereford—which, of course, is in marked contrast to what was proposed by the right hon. Member's Government when they considered local government reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact of the matter is clear, as the right hon. Member knows as well as I do, that there will be an independence in Hereford exactly as my hon. Friend the Minister of State for Wales promised, which is guaranteed to them within the framework of this Bill. That was, of course, quite impossible under the proposals of the last Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting to this Committee that under the Government proposals, the powers of Herefordshire will remain as they are now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They will be vastly in excess of what they would have been when my hon. Friend—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am trying to hear the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows full well that when my hon. Friend the Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson Watt) campaigned at the time of the last Election,
	<span class='label label-info column'>989</span>
he was talking about the prospect of Herefordshire losing any sort of identifiable authority at all. That was the situation that confronted him and he said quite clearly, in language which has been most eloquently depicted to this Committee tonight, that there had to remain powerful authority in Herefordshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall undoubtedly see a situation, when the Boundary Commission come to report on the district pattern, that there will be authority kept for the people of Herefordshire under this Government's proposals in a way that would not have been possible, as my hon. Friend quite clearly pointed out at the last election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have to do a great deal of convincing as far as I can see among the people, councillors, and aldermen of Herefordshire, who do not seem to take quite the same view of his hon. Friend's attitude as he does himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt at all that the people of Herefordshire, as represented through their elected representatives, faced with a choice between this Government's proposals and the last Government's proposals, would have been as keen on voting for our proposals today as they were at the time of the last Election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the Amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee proceeded to a Division:</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will you excuse my confusion, Sir Stephen? I am under the impression that if the Government's Amendment No. 482, the subject of this Division, is carried, then we shall not be able to vote on my Amendments. That is the only reason why I am voting "No". I would agree with a change of name if we have to have a union, but it is the only way I can get a vote on the union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it quite clear that the only way in which to vote for Hereford to be an independent county is to defeat the present Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"in the rural district of Louth, the parishes of Holton-le-Clay and Tetney".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 511 stands in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Kimball) and my hon. Friend the Member for Horncastle (Mr. Tapsell). My hon. Friends, like other hon. Members to whom reference has been made this evening, are not members of the Committee and thus do not have the opportunity to advocate their own cause. I am delighted to attempt to do so on their behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find this task slightly difficult, in that I am a native of Grimsby and have lived most of my life in North Lincolnshire. I know the area intimately, and know full well that there is in Grimsby an acceptance, albeit it a reluctant acceptance on the parf of many people, of the new county ot Humberside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>990</span>
Of course, there are very many people in Lincolnshire—for example, the Lindsey County Council to whom I shall refer again in a few moments—who mourn the parting and dismemberment of this great and ancient county. Personally and emotionally I share those sentiments. Nevertheless, I accept the logic of the estuarial concept which we have earlier discussed, and I wish the new Humberside every possible success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong to say that I do not have some misgivings on this question. Nevertheless, I accept the fact that the Humber Bridge will considerably alter the situation, and I hope that the area will become an importan tpart of the United Kingdom—a thriving, thrusting county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I wish to make abundantly clear that the purpose of the Amendment is not to destroy the concept of Humberside. It is aimed at retaining within Lincolnshire those essentially rural and agricultural parts of North Lincolnshire. After all, Lincolnshire is one of the greatest of farming counties. With my own background, I may perhaps boast that it is the greatest, if the Committee will forgive my local patriotism. All the villages mentioned in the Amendment—I know them very well—are rural villages, and form part of the Lincolnshire rural agricultural scene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amended boundary of Humberside which the Amendment would produce offers a reasonable compromise between those who are excited about the prospect of the new Humberside county and those who wish to retain their Lincolnshire and rural identity. It secures the Humberside concept unimpaired whilst at the same time doing better justice to Lincolnshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lincolnshire contribution to the Humberside county will be massive—250 square miles, 275,000 people and nearly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>991</span>
£16 million rateable value. The whole of industrial North Lincolnshire, with ample room for further expansion, will go into Humberside. The rateable value per head of population in Humberside will remain at £42 as proposed in the Bill, and both banks of the Humber will remain united if the Amendment is accepted. But whilst preserving and securing the Humberside concept it will do better justice to Lincolnshire. That is why my hon. Friends were most anxious that this Amendment should be pressed this evening, and that I should urge these things upon my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Better justice will be done to Lincolnshire. A much larger part of the continuous area in which the county's traditional primary industry is carried out will remain in Lincolnshire, with Brigg as one of its most important centres. Lindsey, which stands to be rudely shattered wherever the boundary be drawn, will be able to make a more comprehensive contribution to the future Lincolnshire county, where the affinities of Lindsey with its county offices in Lincoln must surely be. Under the amended boundary, five-sixths of the area and just over half the population of Lindsey will go to Lincolnshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing is very important. We have talked at length about local attitudes. We had a long debate on the subject recently, and earlier today I had the privilege of speaking to another Amendment for a county further north. The attitude of the Lindsey council is that although, understandably and rightly, it maintains its stand in principle for an all-Lincolnshire County Council, it is prepared to accept the amended boundary as a reasonable compromise. In the circumstances, I ask the Minister to bear very carefully in mind what I am saying to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to quote a telegram which my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough received late last evening and passed to me. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Telegram sent Prime Minister Secretary of Environment Minister of Local Government and Development and Parliamentary Under Secretary as follows Lindsey County Council deplore apparent lack of Government support for all Lincolnshire county despite strength of representations made but noting Government attitude urge Government in strongest possible terms to support Amendment down in name of Marcus Kimball with object of retaining in Lincolnshire agricultural areas traditionally associated with rest of county and without prejudice to massive Lincolnshire contribution towards success for new Humberside".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>992</span>
That is signed by Mr. Scholey, the chairman of the county council and Mr. Sandars, the chairman of the general purposes committee, and it comes with the full authority of that body. I see that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is waving a copy of the telegram at me. Obviously the message reached its required destination. It will now be immortalised in the pages of the OFFICIAL REPORT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need to do any injury to a new and exciting concept, but I ask my hon. Friend to do what was promised earlier with regard to the North Yorkshire Amendments, namely, to consult the local people and the authorities, to look into the matter further, and not to reject the Amendment outright tonight but to give me at least that crumb of comfort and my hon. Friends some real reason for hope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the arguments which the Minister repeatedly put to the Committee in the discussions on the various non-metropolitan counties concerned the need to retain a balance within the county between industrial, urbanised areas and more rural areas. That is one good reason why, when the boundaries of Humberside were first introduced when the Bill was published, on both sides of the Humber estuary a large rural hinterland was also included, as well as the more industrialised cities and the areas on the Humber bank itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the appearance of the proposals in the Bill there have been repeated attempts to push the boundaries further towards the estuary. At one stage the East Riding County Council was trying to create a small metropolitan-type county with surrounding areas on the banks of the river.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was also a proposal, incorporated in an Early Day Motion, for the boundary of Humberside on the south side of the Humber to be a narrow strip of the present county of Lincolnshire. At least Amendment No. 511 takes the boundary further south than that. But having tried to interpret the Amendment on the map of Humberside I see that under the Amendment the proposed boundary would first cut the Isle of Axholme district into two. It would have a boundary running across the Glanford Brigg rural district, so as to include the urban district of Brigg itself on the Lincolnshire side of the boundary. It would also cut off some of the parishes which are in the Grimsby rural district to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>993</span>
include them in Lincolnshire rather than Humberside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One interesting point is that the boundary so drawn would move just to the north of the parishes of Scawby, Elsham and Brocklesby, in each of which there reside well-known local Conservative squires. We are seeing some of the efforts of the backwoodsmen to try to keep Humberside a borough council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That argument is totally unworthy of the hon. Gentleman. These issues cross party lines. It is no less true in this case than in others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I prefer to decide for myself what arguments are worthy. If this matter has not come up in any way that anybody suspects it is a remarkable coincidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been repeated attempts from both sides of the estuary—from the East Riding County Council and from Lindsey County Council—to limit the Humberside County or even to sabotage the whole proposal. All attempts between local authorities within the proposed Humberside area towards co-operation in making arrangements for the new county have met with failure to date because of the reluctance of the county councils on the two sides of the river to co-operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that the East Riding and Lindsey county councils are sulking in their tents at the proposal of the Humberside County. The measures which have been taken by the Kingston upon Hull county borough, the Grimsby county borough and the West Riding County Council to secure co-operation at first-tier level have been hamstrung because of the reluctance of the two other county councils to take part.

There is a feeling that none of this progress in co-operation can go ahead until the Committee clearly takes a decision and until the Ministers clearly state that Humberside is here to stay, and here to stay with the boundaries proposed in the Bill. This message must go out to the whole of Humberside so that all authorities realise that it is in their interests to co-operate in getting the new authority moving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, received a telegram today. It was from the clerk to the Glanford Brigg Rural District Council which is attempting to
	<span class='label label-info column'>994</span>
devise new district boundaries within the new county. His telegram reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Kimball's Amendment wrecks three districts respectfully urge its rejection. My letter of 16th December refers".</p></blockquote>
The interesting thing about the letter of 16th December is that at that stage the clerk of the Glanford Brigg council was critical of the Humberside proposals. I think that he now realises that if Humberside is here to stay, the Amendment will only make the job of drawing up viable district boundaries more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer also to a letter I have received, dated 24th January, 1972, from the clerk of the Isle of Axholme Rural District Council, which lies entirely in the constituency represented by the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Kimball).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am asked to draw the attention of the Committee to two of the council's major policies on local government reorganisation. First, the council supports
	<br><blockquote><p>"the provisions in the Local Government Bill for the creation of a Humberside County and for the inclusion of the Council's area within the Humberside County on the grounds that the future of the area is the paramount consideration and this can best be assured through inclusion in the new county."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that it is the council's wish
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Isle of Axholme should remain intact and its whole area should fall within one new district."</p></blockquote>
Certainly the Isle of Axholme is one of the areas divided by the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to Amendment No. 122, a minor proposal, but none the less important. The Amendment seeks to include two further parishes within the County of Humberside, namely the parishes of Holton-le-Clay and Tetney which are at the northern end of the Louth rural district. Perhaps 25 years ago these two parishes could have been described as almost wholly agricultural in their social make-up, but since the war and with increasing speed over the last 10 years these two villages have been developed with large estates to serve as dormitory villages within the whole community based upon Grimsby and Cleethorpes. In 1969, the population of Tetney was 987 and the population of Holton-le-Clay was 869. A large proportion of these people work either in Grimsby or on the Humber banks. I know that the two villages are served educationally as part of the education
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0541">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>995</span>
division which is based upon Cleethorpes. I myself attended the grammar school in Cleethorpes and went to school with boys from Holton-le-Clay and Tetney. I believe that other county services for Holton-le-Clay and Tetney are also administered from Cleethorpes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has a poll been conducted in Holton-le-Clay and Tetney to see whether the people there want this change?

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final observation is that in the parish of Tetney, not far from the actual village of Tetney, there is a small heliport where helicopters leave to go to the rigs in the North Sea. They are concerned with the exploration for gas and oil beneath the waters of the North Sea. That indicates that perhaps Tetney has some affinity with the industrial areas along the Humber bank, areas which are likely to benefit greatly from the new developments offshore. I therefore speak strongly in favour of Amendment No. 122 and utterly reject Amendment No. 511.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend and colleague from the south bank, the hon.

It is my belief that those foxhunting squires are labouring for the benefit of another foxhunting squire who shall be nameless but who would gain many Conservative votes if these parishes, which lie north of the Scunthorpe, Grimsby, Cleethorpes main turnpike, were taken out of the big northern constituency and moved south into the Gainsborough parliamentary unit. I do not wish to labour that. I am resting my case on solid factual local matters.

What do they say in this belt in mid-Lincolnshire? The Under-Secretary knows that when he was in Lincolnshire on November 24th—this was before feelings were as strongly in favour of the Humberside county—what was said to him then by the mayors of Kingston upon Hull and the others, perhaps in lesser spheres, in Lincolnshire. I will not quote what they said because of the time factor. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will confirm what I said earlier. We have had pieces of paper—like Munich—held up here in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0542">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>997</span>
Committee Room. One could quote a number of these examples, not just Glanford Brigg, but Caistor, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do Mr. Barr, the clerk at Caistor and the clerk at Glanford Brigg say? They say in so many words that they wish to stay together as a district council and they wish to be in Humberside county council. That is it: they do not want to be chopped and hacked about; they do not want to be split up, part going south of the east-west line, which halfway is middle Axholme to the coast south of Cleethorpes. The people who live there do not want it and they send telegrams and letters to hon. Gentlemen, speaking on behalf of their committees and their councils and their council members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make just one quotation from a letter sent by Mr. Ward, the town clerk and chief executive at Grimsby, to Mr. Swaffield, the Secretary of the A.M.C. The text is about the current proposal by certain Lincolnshire M.P.s and it is not in complimentary terms about motions which those hon. Gentlemen tabled. He says.
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not think it is necessary to explain why in terms of effective local government (and more particularly strategic planning and communications network) this strange proposal is so ridiculous. The enclosed copy of my report shows that this remarkable proposal"—</p></blockquote>
or "proposals", since more than one statement has been made—
	<br><blockquote><p>"was universally denounced."</p></blockquote>
I refer to the proposal concerning the "gut" of the estuary, the south bank proposal, and the proposal under discussion. I except Lindsey—which, to quote the town clerk again, "sat on the fence" at these discussions—but not the Briggs and the Caistors. All hon. Members will have received this telegram, although they may not have received the letters which have been sent to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, all the evidence which has come into my hands clearly indicates that it is most important that we should not accept the Amendment and that we should maintain in the Humberside County this belt of land which extends from mid-Axholme south of Scunthorpe, across Caistor and, I hope, will emerge south of Cleethorpes at the parish of Tetney, on the north coast shore. With the passing of each week the feeling hardens among the yeomen of Lincolnshire—those who daily work in the fields and who do not shoot and hunt in the stubble fields—in favour of

Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall). As he rightly pointed out, it is an extremely small Amendment which, while of importance to those affected by it, poses a minor question in the context of local government reorganisation. The question is whether the two parishes of Houghton-le-Clay and Tetney should be moved north in order to bring them within an authority centred around Grimsby and Cleethorpes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Undoubtedly, there is room for discussion, although the Redcliffe-Maud Commission, which examined the question, in detail, did not recommend this proposal. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) said, we have the views of only one of the two parishes—that of Houghton-le-Clay—which would rather remain within the southern county authority than move north as the Amendment envisages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that he has the view of one of the parishes. Has a referendum been held, or is it the view of the parish council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unable to advise the Committee to accept the Amendment tonight. However, the context of my remarks concerning Amendment No. 511 might open up the possibility of re-examining the point in the event of the local people holding strong views and wishing to make representations to us in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main debate tonight concerned Amendment No. 511, in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Kimball) and my hon. Friend the Member for Horncastle (Mr. Tapsell), which was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock. One crucial point which emerged from the debate was the urgency rightly attached by the hon. Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall) to a firm declaration that Humberside is here to stay. At the time of the publication of the Bill Humberside was the major innovation, as a result of which my right hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0543">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>999</span>
Friend the Secretary of State asked me to visit the area in order to hold meetings on the north and south bank and test the opinion of authorities with respect to the radical departure from the Circular 8/71 proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of representations that were made, the Government's view is that Humberside is here to stay. I wish to emphasise that conclusion. Certainly, the overwhelming weight of argument which influenced us in making the original proposals appeared valid. I believe that many authorities representing large numbers of people in the area would support the Government's judgment that the present proposals in the Bill are broadly right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This raises a second point. The controversy is, I think, more to the south than it is to the north. There is to be another debate this evening dealing with a number of parishes on the western side of Humberside, but that is not a major controversy in the sense that we are now considering on the south. Again, the wide degree of support for the concept of Humberside on the north, and the fact that there are no Amendments seeking to move large areas of that, indicates that Humberside as outlined in the Bill, on the north side of the Humber, is broadly right as the Government think it should be implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the south the arguments have been put forward with much greater passion, and a greater degree of feeling has been aroused—both ways, I stress at once. I believe that it is possible to argue that, while the argument has in the past been on whether there should be a Humberside—I was sent to Humberside to listen to the authorities about this issue—perhaps the views of local authorities have not been crystallised finally on what they really want, given that the battle as to whether Humberside should come into existence is now determined. I believe that there is something in the argument put by my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack), that now that everybody has come to accept the Government's view that Humberside is a 	<i>fait accompli,</i> we should at least look at the possibility as to where the line should be on the south. There are certain major facts about that line which I want to make clear, because they follow the sort
	<span class='label label-info column'>1000</span>
of arguments which the hon. Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall) asked us to look at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two of the most controversial issues to the south were centred on the main population centres: first, whether Scunthorpe should be included; second, whether Cleethorpes should be included with Grimsby. It is the Government's firm decision that both these major population centres should be included in the new Humberside proposals. One is left, therefore, with the argument about where the line should go—around, below or above those major centres of population and the heavily industrialised belt to the north.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can well understand that there is a widespread difference of opinion among people who live in the rural areas that I have been describing. There are the obvious rural fears about industrial domination, the feeling that they have local ties to the south with Lincolnshire County Council, as it will be—the sort of arguments with which the Committee is familiar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask hon. Members not to press this case to a Division but to allow it to rest until we move to Report, so that the views of the local people in what one might describe as the marginal areas may be expressed, the agricultural rural areas which, obviously, in large part, will remain agricultural areas, which could argue ties to the south. I have to make clear that the rural districts have almost entirely made their views clear in favour of staying in Humberside. There are also the views of the parish councils, which have not perhaps focused as definitely as they might on the question of the line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to put the matter clearly to the Committee. First, Humberside should come into existence. Second, it should take the substantial populations and urban industrial areas to the south of the Humber. I suggest that we leave this matter until Report By that time, I have no doubt, we shall have a total ability to assess the marginal cases in the surrounding areas. On that basis, I ask the hon. Member for Goole and my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock not to press their Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of these Amendments would be to transfer to Humberside five parishes which are at the moment in the Selby Rural District, and therefore to be included in the proposed North Yorkshire County. The map of the Humberside boundaries shows that the boundary of the proposed county on the western side of the municipal borough of Goole comes quite close to the actual borough, forming a kind of nose to North Yorkshire pointing into Humberside. The five parishes involved are the five parishes in that nose, Carlton. Newland, Drax, Long Drax and Camblesforth. However, it is only fair that I should point out that the nose is formed by natural boundaries, two rivers. To the north, the river Ouse, and to the south, the rive Aire. The bridge over the Aire links the parish of Carlton with the parish of Snaith and Cowick. That bridge carries a main trunk road, and from the communications point of view Carlton is part of the community centred on Goole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The River Aire forms the northern boundary of my constituency, and one of my slight embarrassments since I became the Member for Goole is that those on the northern side of the boundary, who are within the community centred on Goole. bring me their problems, and I have to refer them to the hon. Member for Barkston Ash (Mr. Alison).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the five parishes there are 2,440 people, of whom nearly a half. 1,150, are within the parish of Carlton. Carlton has very close links with the parish of Snaith and Cowick in the Goole Rural District which is to be included in Humberside. The two parishes are part of the same community. People working in Goole live in Carlton, and 	<i>vice versa.</i> Many people living on the Goole side, in the town and
	<span class='label label-info column'>1002</span>
the rural district, go over the river to work at Drax power station—the other factor involved in the five parishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authorities, Goole Borough and Goole Rural District, have over the years become gradually surrounded by power stations, yet they have not had the good fortune to have a power station constructed within their own local authority boundaries. The Amendment would have the effect of including the Drax power station within a district council in Humberside. to be centred upon Goole. Humberside will not be richly blessed in power stations, as compared with West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. North Yorkshire, where Drax will be according to the Bill, unless amended, already has the other power station at Egborough. So there is some ground in justice and fairness in transferring Drax along with these other parishes into Humberside and, therefore, into the local authority which will be including Goole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment would add Humberside, as the hon. Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall) has said, five parishes in Selby Rural District which lie in the peninsula between the Ouse and the lower stretch of the Aire before it joins the Ouse. There is this sa-called nose sticking out, and it looks reasonable enough to cut it off and put it in the next door neighbour's garden, but the parishes are valuable real estate because they include the site of the Drax power station, which is now partly operational and partly still under construction on an area of some 600 to 700 acres. That is in the parish of Long Drax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Long Drax is to be in Humberside, the others have to go, too, because they are between Goole and the power station. Geographically, apart from the position on the map, these parishes are really far better as part of North Yorkshire because there is the main road, the A1041, which is a trunk road from Selby to Campbellforth and Carlton. There is only one road connecting the parishes with Goole Rural District, and again the A1041 which crosses the river to Snaith at Carlton. From Snaith it is seven miles to Goole. There are river crossings across the River Aire at Newland and across the Ouse at Long Drax, but they are railway bridges.

of these parishes to be transferred when I had the meeting with local authorities at Hull University. I came to the conclusion then that, because Selby Rural District was opposed to the transfer and the parishes come under Selby Rural District Council, it was best to leave them where they are where we have drawn them on the map now, because they have this joining up with North Yorkshire.

However, to people in my part of the world these Amendments are of enormous importance. They will have the effect together of enabling Yarmouth to breathe, as well as making it possible for Yarmouth to be some sort of administrative unit under the new boundaries. At the moment, the situation with this ancient town is that to the north it is completely developed, whilst taking half the town and going westwards, which would be away from the sea towards Norwich, it cannot develop because it is all marshland. A little bit further south than that, if one goes to the west again, it is water—drain water. So there is only one possible way in which it can breathe and that is to the south and west at the south end of the town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yarmouth is surrounded by parishes in the Lothingland Rural District Council. The parishes are called Burgh Castle,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1004</span>
Bradwell, Belton, Hopton and Herringfleet. When I spoke on Second Reading I really made a Committee speech, because I was not certain of being put on the Committee. I said then that although modern bargaining consists of asking for a lot and hoping to get a little, I thought that my right hon. Friend was so helpful that if I only asked for a little I would probably get a lot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 midnight
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After that, I had discussions with various people and it seemed to me that we should not ask for the nine parishes that I was then asking for but that we should come to some arrangement where by the parishes that we did ask for would be, generally speaking, acceptable, whilst allowing Great Yarmouth room to move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as I can see the only authority which is really a bit "anti" is the Lothingland Rural District Council. Originally the East Suffolk County Council was agreed that this should go forward. When people talked about the surprising fact of the Bill changing the original idéas in the White Paper, they talked, most surprisingly of all, about the fact that it ignores the conclusion reached by East Suffolk County Council that the nine most northerly parishes of the Suffolk line south of Great Yarmouth were to remain in Suffolk instead of going to Norfolk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a word about the objection that I think there is on the part of Lothingland, though it does not seem to have been very strong or to have excited any great protest. I remind my hon. Friend of one piece of history concerning Lothingland. This comes from a book written in the sixteenth century. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I find in an old record book that in 1230 a jury of twelve men at the Norfolk Assizes, before Solomon de Rolfe and his fellow justices, held that Yarmouth was granted a Charter by King John for a yearly rent of £55 which King Henry assigned, together with the Manor of Lothingland, for 40 years to John Baliol and Deyirgoil, his wife, in return for certain lands in Cheshire."</p></blockquote>
That is extraordinary, but what is much more germane is that many years before the sixteenth century the river ran out of the harbour of Yarmouth—which had the greatest fishing in the whole of Europe at that time—four miles south of where it now does. The result was that because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0546">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1005</span>
the stretch of water was too long they made another exit well above that and closer to the present exit. As it says in this book:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This provided an opportunity for the Lords of Lothingland to claim the land to the south of new outlets and resulted in many law suits between Yarmouth and the claimants."</p></blockquote>
Lothingland gets its beginnings from this. That land was the subject of claims over very many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, those claims have been dormant for a long time, and so far as I know a perfectly happy atmosphere exists between the various bodies in that part of the world. Lowestoft admits that those parishes should be part of Yarmouth—one hesitates to use the horrible word "conurbation"—because they all look towards Yarmouth. The parish of Bradwell really is part of Yarmouth. There is no dispute about that. The people shop in Yarmouth. Many of them work in Yarmouth. Their travelling day by day is all towards Yarmouth; never towards Lowestoft in the south. Almost the same can be said of Hopton, and certainly of Burgh Castle. They look towards Yarmouth. And the same is also mainly true of Belton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the furthest two parishes in my Amendment—-I have included only a part of Herringfleet, in order to include part of the A143—from Yarmouth, and the most likely of the five and a bit parishes suggested in the Amendment to have been annoyed about going in with Yarmouth, I have a letter here from a Mr. N. Cannel which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is the unanimous wish of the Parish Meetings of Herringfleet and Fritton, both of which I represent on the Lothingland R.D.C., that they should be included"</p></blockquote>
in the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the time, I do not wish to detain the Committee. The case for those parishes is so strong as to brook no refusal that I can possibly see. One has only to look at the map to see that the Amendments are absolutely logical in order to give Yarmouth room to breathe. Therefore, it is with great hopes that I commend the two Amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"in the rural district of Brackley the parishes of Chacombe, Middleton Cheney, Warkworth, Kings Sutton and Aynho."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this early hour of Wednesday morning, I rise to move the Amendment standing in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Mr. Marten). As the Committee well knows, my hon. Friend is not always in favour of territorial associations or amalgamations, but on this occasion he feels that it is important that the views of his contituents should be heard and carefully considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper proposed that one of the new non-metropolitan counties should be Area 33 and that it should be based on Oxfordshire as it exists, but with the addition of the Brackley rural district and the borough of Brackley in Northamptonshire. The existing Oxfordshire County Council, the Banbury Borough Council and the Banbury Rural District Council welcome this proposal, and one might add in parenthesis that the Redcliffe-Maud Report and Mr. Senior's dissenting memorandum recognised the affinity of the Brackley rural district with the borough of Banbury. It was therefore of great surprise to my hon. Friend and the Banbury Borough Council when no part of Northamptonshire was included in the new Oxfordshire. Oxfordshire County Council, Banbury Borough Council and Banbury Rural District Council have agreed to press strongly all the Amendments so as to provide for the inclusion

	<span class='label label-info column'>1007</span>
at least of the fringe parishes of Chacombe. Middleton Cheney, Warkworth, Kings Sutton and Aynho in Oxfordshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Banbury is an expanding town under the Town Development Act and has attracted considerable industry during the past decade. Many of the people working in Banbury live in these fringe parishes and the main A41 trunk road from Banbury to Bicester runs through the parish of Aynho. This will be especially undesirable after April, 1974, because Banbury and Bicester are likely to be linked to the new county district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people from these fringe parishes look to Banbury for their work, entertainment, shopping, and their education, and. by special arrangements between Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire County Councils, for many other facilities. The Brackley Rural District Council has agreed to contribute financially to a new leisure centre being constructed by the Banbury Borough Council. Banbury Borough Council's latest industrial development will be carried out within half a mile of the borough boundary and with Brackley Rural district, a new 24-inch foul sewer is being constructed, to serve future developments in part of the fringe parishes. Bearing in mind all these local factors, my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury felt it important that the Committee should deliberate on these matters and he asked me to urge my hon. Friend to give them careful consideration. I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to give me a sympathetic reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a constituency matter for me and I will speak for a few moments only about it. The argument arises essentially from the existing County of Oxford. The background, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) has said, is that in the original proposals there were suggestions that part of Northamptonshire should be joined to the northern part of Oxfordshire. But that is not in the Bill now, and the decision turns on the maintenance of the ancient and historic county boundaries to which I made reference on a previous Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a copy of the letter which Oxfordshire addressed to the Secretary of State saying that it was essential that this small area comprising the five parishes in my constituency should go into the new
	<span class='label label-info column'>1008</span>
Oxfordshire and base the case essentially on the links which these five parishes have with Banbury. They have formed part of Northamptonshire for a long time and this is part of a rural country area in isolation. It has no direct affinity with Banbury and is some way distant from the county town of Northampton. It is a delightful rural part of England and these parishes have a natural affinity with the district proposed by Oxford. They say that there is an affinity with the proposed district of the Oxfordshire area for services, employment, shopping and recreational facilities, which is not a substantial case for taking these five parishes into the county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is said that Banbury is an expanding town and. as these five parishes see it, the expansion will be to the east of Banbury and into this rural area. Understandably, the whole community objects to that proposal, as does the County Council of Northamptonshire. This is an impertinent proposal on the part of Oxfordshire which I hope will be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to my two hon. Friends the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) and the hon. Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones) you will appreciate. Sir Stephen, the dilemma of this finely balanced argument. The earlier inclination of the Government favoured the arguments put forward on behalf of the hon. Member for Banbury and my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock. We believed that there was a community of interest and an argument in favour of adjustment, which was why it was published in Circular 8/71.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local people, as represented by their rural district and all the parishes concerned and. of course, by the Northamptonshire County Council, were totally opposed to this proposal, and as the argument seemed finely balanced we felt it would be better to move to the posture we argued in the other Oxfordshire boundary situation, in that there is. perhaps, a case for a more limited review under the auspices of the Boundary Commission after 1974. I advise the Committee to permit this Amendment to be withdrawn so that it may be looked at in a calmer light when circumstances make it possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
