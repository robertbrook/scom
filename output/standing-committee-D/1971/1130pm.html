	<div class='title'>NEW LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS IN ENGLAND</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment No. 1 proposed</i>—(	<i>25th November</i>)—in page 1, line 10, to leave out from the word "as" to end of line 11 and insert the words "unitary authorities"—[	<i>Mr. John Silkin</i>].</p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Lamond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying as the Committee adjourned that I was disappointed, as was my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfieid (Mr. Carter), by the lack of response of hon. Members opposite. Having had an opportunity since then of reading a large number of letters, which arrived today, putting the case for constituencies in England and Wales, I feel that it is incumbent on hon. Members opposite, if not to speak now, at least during the debate on local authority boundaries to give closely reasoned and fairly lengthy explanations of why the Government are either to change their minds and accept these representations that we have received, or to reject them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to give an account of my experience in what I consider to be a unitary authority, as unitary as any authority is likely to be. That authority is in Scotland, but the experience there is not irrelevant. That authority had responsibility for almost all the services provided within its boundaries, with the exception of the fire service and, more recently, water supply, which was placed under the responsibility of the North-Eastern Regional Water Board a year or two ago. Up to that time the authority had supplied water very satisfactorily. For 700 years, this unitary local authority has existed and provided services to as near the satisfaction of the ratepayers as one could
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>104</span>
wish. Ratepayers, of course, always have a grievance, mainly about the level of rates; but the services provided met their satisfaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience is that system of the two-tier authorities, has faults. I know the Minister would like to refer to a two-sphere authority. That has been mentioned today. But if there are to be two local authorities within an area, I do not believe that the citizens of the area will regard them as anything other than two-tier. We may call them two-sphere and even suggest that they have equal responsibility and so on. but the people concerned will always regard one as having more authority than the other, one to be blamed by the other when some service is not being satisfactorily provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have noticed that where there are two-tier authorities in Scotland—I am sorry to draw my example from Scotland, but it is relevant—with small district councils, for example, interest in them is not nearly so great as the interest in a bigger local authority, such as Aberdeen. That runs contrary to the experience of my hon. Friend the Member for North-field. A measure of the interest shown by the citizens may be found in the number of candidates presenting themselves for election to local authorities. For example, in the unitary authority of Aberdeen, for 12 seats there were 46 candidates, representing five or six different political parties—we have the S.N.P. there—and independents. That sort of competition for places means that that council is lively and attracts interest and attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, with a district council, the lower tier in a county, it is common for no one to contest a seat for 21 years on end. a state of affairs which is neither healthy nor satisfactory. It means that people are not interested in what is going on. that they realise that at lower tier level it makes little difference who is elected to the district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish that state of affairs to prevail even more widely, as it would under the Bill. Thus. I expect Government supporters to defend their proposals and demonstrate why the careful and lengthy examination made by the Royal Commission has in the end resulted in proposals which, in the Government's opinion, were wrong. What criterion did they use to determine what constitutes a good local authority? I believe that giving a local authority the maximum freedom
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>105</span>
to govern its own area is the best criterion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much was said in the Government's White Paper about the high ideal of much greater freedom for local authorities. But let us examine the Government's policies, particularly the Bill concerned with council rents, that will tie local authorities hand and foot in fixing council house rents, and even the petty Bill concerning school milk, that refuses to give a local authority power to determine whether it will provide free milk for schoolchildren. If the Government mean what they say about local authorities having more power, they should not deny them that type of power. After all, the authorities are answerable directly, and sometimes more frequently than we, to the people whom they are charging for providing children with free milk? If that is not a sufficiently good check on whether a local authority carries out a certain activity, it is wrong for Parliament to step in and tell them exactly what they must do, down to every last item of expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among local authorities there is the feeling that the House of Commons regards them as pawns in a game, of being of not much account. The Bill will do little to dispel that impression. Local authorities feel that whatever they undertake, there is always Big Brother hanging over their heads, changing any proposal which may not suit the Government. I am saying that even a unitary system is a two-tier system, for the Government stands supreme over all local authorities. If we want local authorities to mean something to their citizens, we should be prepared to give them power and trust them to use it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a reasonable time in which to discuss Amendment No. 1 which reflects the belief of the Opposition that the unitary system should replace the two-tier system proposed by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side are disappointed with the course of the discussion, not least because the proceedings have become a monologue instead of a dialogue, which is of tremendous importance in considering the future of local government. I know that you. Sir Stephen, are not responsible for the selection of Committee members, but the composition of the Government benches, taken together with the failure of hon. Members to make an effective
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>106</span>
contribution to what is being said, leads us to conclude that the Committee has been absolutely and completely rigged and that there will be no proper attempt to discuss the principles of local Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure the hon. Gendeman appreciates that what he is saying now is a matter for the Committee of Selection and not a matter for this Committee. I hope, therefore, that he will not pursue the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, Sir Stephen, I know it is not a matter for this Committee and I am not therefore proposing to change its composition—I would if I could—but I am entitled to draw attention to the way in which we are dealing with the first Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. The hon. Gentleman was not just commenting on how we are dealing with the Amendment. He made an allegation that the Committee was rigged. Surely that is a charge against the Selection Committee, and on reconsideration should be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was for that reason that I intervened. I do not wish me hon. Gentleman to go too far. I hope that he does not, but he will realise that the composition of this Committee is entirely a matter for the Committee of Selection. I hope he will now proceed with his argument and leave the Committee of Selection to its own responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Withdraw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far from withdrawing, I intend to substantiate my point. It is a matter of considerable importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Gentleman proceeds with this matter I have to intervene once again. Allegations of that kind against the Committee of Selection must not be pursued in this Committee. They would be completely out of order, and I should have so to rule if he attempted to make allegations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You would, indeed, Sir Stephen. I shall be much obliged if you will hear the point I wish to make before making a ruling which otherwise would be premature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not criticising you or the Com-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>107</span>
mittee of Selection. I am explaining—and I think the country is entitled to an explanation—the extraordinary proceedings which are taking place in the Committee. I am seeking to do only that. It will be within your knowledge, Sir Stephen, and that of other right hon. and hon. Gentlemen, that during the two-day Second Reading debate we had a succession of Conservative speakers attacking the Bill. My researches reveal that in two whole days of debate only two Conservative speakers had a good word to say for the Bill, and as both of them sat down within ten minutes they could not have found many good words to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Swain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend also draw attention to the fact that the two hon. Members who gave the Bill an unreserved welcome admitted that they were not affected by it in any way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always glad to have my hon. Friend direct my mind more forcibly to the point I am making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not one Tory Member who opposed the proposals in the Bill is a member of the Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must get away from criticisms of the Committee of Selection. The hon. Gentleman must direct himself to the Amendment, and not criticise the Committee of Selection. I have no objection to his passing whatever remarks he likes about the way in which this Committee is conducted, so long as he keeps within the rules of order, but I should be less than fair to the Committee of Selection, and I am sure that he will appreciate that, if I did not stand between him and his criticising of that Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Sir Stephen. I am having a little difficulty explaining myself as adequately as I hope I normally do. I am not criticising the Committee of Selection; I want to set your mind at rest about that. I will re-phrase my criticism. It is hon. Gentlemen opposite whom I am seeking to criticise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is so upset because we have not spoken much, he should not give way so ungraciously. For the last two days we have been debating the unitary principle; we have not been debating the rest of the Bill. He will find that we have plenty to say about a lot of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>108</span>
Member's assurance. My complaint is that we have not been debating anything. It has been a monologue, with the wonderful exception of the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack), who has taken a constructive part in our proceedings, as I am prepared to allow that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman again. If members of the Committee will pay the hon. Member a little attention, as I am seeking to do, we shall be able to proceed apace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Stephen, for now seeking to protect my interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that we have not heard anything about the effects on Essex, for example, and that no hon. Gentleman opposite has sought to deal with the problem of Essex, Luton, Birmingham and the West Midlands. One could go round the country making the fair point that one after another these authorities have felt that their interests would have been better served by the unitary system. But the case against that has not been put, except by the Minister, who appears to be shouldering the whole of the responsibility for the Conservative contribution to our affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been carefully scanning the faces of Government supporters, but I cannot see one Member who actually spoke on Second Reading Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a fact. I am keeping myself in check because I do not want to incur your displeasure, Sir Stephen, but I had intended to talk about Standing Order No. 62. In deference to you, however, I shall not do that. My hon. Friend is right to say that the overwhelming number of hon. Members opposite did not speak on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Daniel Awdry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is unfair: I spoke. A number of issues that I wish to raise will be dealt with fully. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) refers to Luton. I was talking to the representative who came from Luton today. The number in that instance is 172 and that will surely be fullv debated shortly. It might not be debated if we waste a lot of time at this stage on a general discussion. We all know that we cannot make any progress on this Amendment. There are a great many pro-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0068">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>109</span>
blems, I assure the hon. Member, that we wish to talk about, if he will only give us time later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that it would help the Committee if we got over discussing what occurred on Second Reading and what did not and got down to discussing the Amendment. That would put us all in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to raise this matter. I did not mean it to be a point of order; I meant it to be an interjection, but no one has allowed it to me. I wouud not expect the hon. Member to pay me the compliment of withdrawing what he said about Second Reading, but I am sure that he will agree that, as well as my hon. Friend, I have tried to make a humble contribution to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall not get on very quickly if the hon. Gentleman gives way to a succession of interruptions. That is the third in his speech without his replying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having looked more closely at hon. Gentlemen opposite, I distinguish two animate figures. I completely withdraw my statement that all hon. Members opposite were not animate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we are making some progress. Because I knew that two hon. Gentlemen opposite had spoken, I did not repeat my hon. Friend's terminology. My expression was "overwhelmingly".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the subject of Luton, about which I was interrupted a moment ago. It is worth making the point as this morning I spent some time with the Mayor, the Town Clerk and the leader of the Luton Corporation. We shall later discuss how Luton can make the best of a bad job, if I may use that terminology. Luton's fundamental objection is that it does not want either the Government's original proposals or the Amendments which it has been forced to suggest. Luton wants the unitary system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, Luton is governed from Luton. Under the Labour Government's proposals, Luton would still be governed by Luton. But under Schedule 1 of the Bill Luton will be governed from Bedford, 20 miles away. Luton councillors are making the very proper case that in service after service, the citizens
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>110</span>
of Luton, accustomed to going to their town hall and seeing people and getting things done, will find themselves 20 miles removed from the seat of power. They very properly say that this cannot mean more efficient government by their authority. It is a change to which all councillors, of all political persuasions in Luton object.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is on this Amendment that Luton and Plymouth and Exeter and other places are entitled to say what they would like in the place of the system being imposed upon them by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman gives way, may I say that at the moment he is completely in order; but I hope that he will not be led astray by further interruptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important interruption, Sir Stephen and intimately apposite. Southend, I understand, is also in this difficulty. This is clearly an important issue and near to the heart of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might be in trouble with you, Sir Stephen, if I went to Southend, even by way of Luton. It would be a very Chestonian experience. However, I have no wish to embarrass the Chairman for whom we all have great respect. We all know that Southend and many other authorities have this difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I had been the Minister and had had to spend two and a half sittings on one Amendment, I should have found it a galling experience, but the number of authorities feeling as Luton does that have not even been mentioned in our discussions in the last two days demonstrates that a lot of ground has gone by default in the interest of making reasonable progress on the Bill. One could go through the list, but, for example, Nottingham, Leicester and Derby feel as strongly as does Luton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 25th November, the Minister dealt with the demolition job being done on our county boroughs, which gives great offence to all the Opposition. I have previously quoted the two appropriate paragraphs from Redcliffe-Maud both of which have sustained the county borough principle. The Minister said that he wished
	<br><q><p>"to bring the strength of the present county
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0069">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>111</span>
borough system into the surrounding areas…. I speak, subject of course, to the special needs and arrangements for conurbations."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D,</i> 25th November, 1971; 	<i>cc.</i> 41-42.]</p></q>
Strong feelings about the arrangements are abroad. The quiet acquiescence of hon. Members opposite strengthens the feeling that the Bill is concerned largely with political gerrymandering of boundaries and local authority designations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister paid tribute to the county borough system and to what he says is its strength. If he really believes that the county borough system has been the strength of local government, as his words suggest, what on earth are we doing destroying it? He went on to be even more emphatic. He said:
	<br><q><p>"These have always been our most effective local government units."</p></q>
He added:
	<br><q><p>"but it implies that all the rest of the country will have much weaker units."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D,</i> 25th November, 1971; 	<i>c.</i> 43.]</p></q>
It is on that proposition that I want to spend one or two minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the county borough system has always been the most effective of our local government units, why on earth are we now seeking to destroy it? An overwhelming case will have to be put before Parliament if one seeks to destroy something admitted to be the most effective unit of local government to satisfy us beyond any peradventure that what we intend to put in its place will be even more effective than that which we destroy. I do not know of anybody in the whole field of local government who accepts that proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had a letter the other day from a Mr. George Jones of the London School of Economics, an expert in local government, arising directly out of my speech on this point during our first sitting. He made the point direct saying that where-ever one looked—and he had spent his whole life examining local government—all that we cherished most and all the pioneering effort in our towns and our cities, the industrial base on which we built the country's wealth, emerged from the county borough system of local government. He saw nothing in the whole of the Bill, which seeks to destroy that system, to give us any confidence about the future. That is to paraphrase what Mr. Jones told me; I believe it to be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>112</span>
true. The Minister has said nothing to suggest that he has come anywhere near meeting that criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The all-purpose authority has served the nation well over the years, and we destroy it at our peril. In seeking to destroy it, we bring upon ourselves all the tremendous difficulties which my hon. Friends have pointed out during the last two and a half sittings, not just the operation of services, not just their efficiency and so on, but the feeling of confidence of so many citizens in our large towns that councillors are the men who can do something about complaints. So many people who have lived and worked under that system for so long will now find that responsibility rests with a councillor 20 miles away, if it is a Luton citizen, or 42 miles away for someone living in Plymouth.

I am reminded of an earlier role when I was a Birmingham councillor. I found myself in the Chancery Court because we had had the temerity to allow free travel to old-age pensioners. An irate ratepayer took us to the court and, unfortunately, he won. Giving his judgment against the Birmingham Corporation, which had been arguing that the committee responsible for transport was different from the committee responsible for general purposes, and that therefore the two functions were separate, the learned judge used the immortal phrase, "Birmingham is one and indivisible". I told my town clerk that never again would he tell me that I could not say anything on the council because the education committee had it in hand, or that some decision was a matter for the transport committee. The whole basis of that judgment was the indivisibility of local government, and its importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an interesting thought that under these arrangements we would never have had free travel for old people in Birmingham, because the transport authority would not be the Birmingham District Council, and another authority, removed from the scene of activity, would have had the responsibility. That is one illustration of a service—taken up all over the country and now nationwide—which would never have got off the ground had these arrangements been in operation at the time. There would have been no free travel scheme in the City of Birmingham, or elsewhere.

5.0 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister talks of special arrangements for the conurbations, as he did in columns 41 and 42, we are entitled to know what he means. This morning, in a further amplification of his views on this aspect of the Amendment, the Minister told us that Crowther cannot affect what we are doing in the Bill. Have we ever heard a more palpable nonsense? If we are to destroy single all-purpose authorities, and to put so restrictive a boundary around our conurbations that the conurbations cannot solve their own problems, there must be some form of regional government machinery, whether provincial government, or regional government, and we on this side of the Committee hope that it will have some democratic content.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our great fear is of regional or provincial government by branches of Whitehall, not answerable to anybody but the Minister, with bureaucrats not answerable to the local authorities, or to Parliament, making the strategic or planning decisions. Bureaucratic government is not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should tell us the Government's views on Crowther. When the Minister says that Crowther cannot affect the Bill, that presupposes a knowledge of Crowther. If the Minister has some knowledge of Crowther, that is more than we have. We have been asked to accept his judgment, but we have no information. If the Minister has no inside knowledge of Crowther, then the position is even more ludicrous. Suppose that Crowther were to produce proposals for regional or provincial government which materially affected the Bill, and the functions of local government; we would all look stupid. We should have enacted a complete new system for the entire local government of England and Wales, and a month or two after the passage of the Bill Crowther would be saying that this should be amended to take account of regional and provincial considerations that it regards as important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will say something on provincial government, and Crowther, since we shall come back to the point time and time again. The point is of supreme importance, and this is the right moment for the Minister to say something on it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>114</span>
We have not had time, on this series of Amendments, to go into all the boundaries that we would have liked to have put in, for unitary system and metropolitan areas. Putting into a Schedule the Redcliffe-Maud Commission's proposals does not mean that they are accepted in every jot and tittle. Many of my hon. Friends would have wished to draw attention to improvements that could be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) has made a striking speech on the recommendations as they affected North Worcestershire. In the last Government I believe Ministers were reaching the conclusion that perhaps the proposals for that area were not quite right, and should be looked at again. But I am certain, having listened to the hon. Gentleman stating the case in detail the other day, one would have thought that he had made a very strong case indeed in respect of the boundaries of North Worcestershire. Therefore, that would have been an Amendment which we should have been happy to make in those circumstances. It also applies to a lot of my other hon. Friends who made out very important cases on individual boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the point of principle. The Minister stated that there was a substantial principle which he thought should govern local government structure. This was adequately dealt with in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West (Mr. Armstrong) this morning. I wrote down the principles which the Minister thought it right to refer to but which, he told us in a series of negatives, ought not to be matters of great and overriding importance to the Committee. He said, when talking about the substantial principle, that it
	<br><q><p>"is not primarily one of efficiency, or tradition, or loyalties or … 'travel to work areas'… nor … a matter of population,"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D,</i> 25th November, 1971; 	<i>c.</i> 39.]</p></q>
He ruled out all those things as being the important criteria on which to build up the future of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to spend a minute looking at each of those. I do not want to delay the Committee, but it is important when considering what is in the Minister's mind and what the Government are thinking. The first is: "not primarily a matter of efficiency." I should have thought that the most important thing about local government is the efficiency of the services which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>115</span>
it renders. I do not see how one can rule out the question of efficiency. If services can be more efficiently organised in one way rather than in another, surely this must be right. It is the most important question of all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not yet discussed finance. I am not quite sure, subject to your guidance, Sir Stephen, when will be the moment in the consideration of the Bill to deal with finance. We are all in the dark about that. We have had a very muddle-headed Green Paper from the Government on the subject. Just as we are having to talk in the vacuum of Crowther, the vacuum of financial matters also is there for us to see. The whole question of rateable value and rate demands is absolutely essential to the question of efficiency, as to how local authorities can do their job and whether they can raise the money they need in order to sustain the services which they have available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an even bigger problem. When there is the county system with districts involved, it will be the top tier that will be precepting on the lower tier. That means that the councillors in the lower tier have got the dirty end of the stick. They have to collect the money for the top tier with no say at all in how efficiently that money shall be used. It will not be the top tier authority councillors, who only come up for election once every four years, who will be carrying the can; it will be the councillors of the lower tier authority. This is a principle which the hon. Gentleman apparently wished to hallow here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman says that we ought not to determine the future of local government primarily on matters of tradition. I do not know how one is to take that, Sir Stephen. I must say with some amazement that when I hear a Conservative Minister telling us that we should have no regard to the tradition in our services—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite prepared to listen attentively to the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister did not say it, of course I would withdraw it. But the hon. Gentleman did say it. It is here. I wrote it down very carefully. It is in column 39.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
	<br><q><p>"There is a substantial principle at the basis of our proposals for local government reorganisation. The principle is not primarily one of efficiency, or tradition …"</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that the Committee need pay no attention to that. That is what the hon. Gentleman said that I said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I did say that. However, if I did say that, the Committee should pay no attention, I withdraw that remark at once. Nevertheless, I have used the word throughout—I wrote it down to make sure that I got it right—not "primarily" a matter of tradition. I never thought I should hear a Conservative Minister discounting the value of the importance of tradition in local government service. Our entire local government service is based on good tradition, one of the justifications of which is its ability to adapt to change, and get rid of bad tradition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Michael Heseltine)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Simply as a matter of accuracy, my hon. Friend said that efficiency, loyalties and tradition all have their place within that principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will quote again what the hon. Gentleman said:
	<br><q><p>"The principle is not primarily one of efficiency, or tradition, or loyalties, or the support of the existing establishment …"</p></q>
I did not quote the hon. Gentleman as having said that we should totally disregard them. Nonetheless, he did say that they were not "primarily" matters of efficiency or tradition. Yet anyone who has served on a local authority knows the importance of this question of tradition. I think I am right in saying that out of seven Ministers of the Crown at present serving in the Department of the Environment, not one has ever served on a local authority. That situation explains much of the hotchpotch and nonsense of the Bill which we are considering—a Bill which could never have been constructed by anyone who knew what he was talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another consideration to which the Minister has told use we should not pay primary regard is our travel-to-work areas. It appears to me, from the vantage point of Whitehall, that one thing that concerns the public above any other is the terrible inconvenience of their travel to work; the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>117</span>
transport system and the inability to get to work cheaply; the choked condition of the roads; the inadequacy of the public transport service. Those are all matters of major concern when discussing the future basis of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last of the Minister's negative principles was
	<br><q><p>"nor is it primarily a matter of population."</p></q>
What is population? Population is people. To be fair, the Minister at one stage made a point concerning the importance of people when determining the future structure of local government. I should have put the principle of population higher than any other when making such decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After dismissing all those considerations as being not of primary importance, the Minister then told us what, in his view, local government is primarily about. He said:
	<br><q><p>"… we want to produce units which are capable of government over a wide area in terms of their effect on the lives of the people."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D,</i> 25th November, 1971; 	<i>c.</i> 39.]</p></q>
That seems contradictory to the point which he made earlier about the relatively unimportant principle of population. In this connection I cite again the examples of Luton and Plymouth, which will no doubt recur many times during Committee. When discussing units of government which are capable of efficiency over a wide area, one is entitled to say," That is not what we are producing with respect to the proposals for Plymouth or Luton, or for Birmingham and many other towns. We support the principle of the Amendment, which seeks to establish unitary authorities."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one demolishes the unitary system, even ineffectively in argument, as the Minister has done, one must then consider the alternative—in this case the county system. What proposition has the Minister put before us? When dealing with the county system, he said:
	<br><q><p>"The Government's proposals are based on the widely accepted belief that operational responsibility should be exercised within two spheres of government."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D,</i> 25th November, 1971; 	<i>c.</i> 42.]</p></q>
Where is the evidence for the proposition that government based on two-tiers—the county system and the district system—is more efficient than the unitary system
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>118</span>
which the Government are seeking to demolish?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Tory Party Conference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says "The Tory Party Conference". From a philosophical point of view it is interesting to note that the Minister has not attempted to answer the rather profound contribution made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) in his closing remarks on Tuesday morning. Nothing in the Minister's speech suggests that he has met the arguments proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister said what I have already quoted from column 42 of the OFFICIAL REPORT, it was a flat contradiction of the tribute he had earlier paid to the county borough system. The Minister cannot say at one moment that the county borough system has been efficient, and later that it is a widely accepted belief that there should be two spheres of government. Widely accepted by whom? Who are the people who accept the proposition that the government of large towns should be taken over by two spheres? The only people I can find who have such beliefs are Conservatives in county councils. I have not found town clerks, clerks of authorities, treasurers, chief constables or education authorities holding that extraordinary view. It is interesting that the Minister cannot find any evidence to support his argument. The need for the Amendment has been more than adequately argued by hon. Members on this side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make a further, point. In column 38 of the Report of our previous Sitting when the Minister referred to the time allotted to consultations, he said that local authorities had been given three months in which to make representations about their boundaries, and that
	<br><q><p>"we extended that period for a further month to those whose political colour had changed …"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D,</i> 25th November, 1971, 	<i>cc.</i> 38 and 42.]</p></q>
Although I appreciate what he said, I must know what will happen to those local authorities whose political complexion will be changed in April of next year. Will the Minister say whether those local authorities, whose political complexion will be changed next May and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>119</span>
who will wish to make violent representations about the new boundaries established by the Government, will have an opportunity to do so before the Bill is passed into law? If they do not, then the silence of hon. Ministers opposite and the way in which the Bill is being hurried through can lead us only to the worst possible view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of what I have said, I hope the Minister will give an undertaking that local authorities wishing to make representations will be enabled to do so. I hope my right hon. and hon. Friends will support the Amendment in the sure knowledge that the unitary system which has achieved most for local governments in this country ought not to be destroyed. If the Government succeed in destroying the the unitary system, by our vote today we shall serve notice upon the country, upon local government and Parliament, that we shall have to return to the problem yet again if all our worst wears about local government come to be proved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the speech of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) largely as an answer to what I have said previously, and I do not think it would be profitable to the Committee for us to go on arguing the same points. But there are one or two matters I must clear up. First, perhaps I ought to say that I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the assurance or undertaking for which he asked in his last few sentences, namely that if there is a change of colour in local government, I shall ask Parliament to go back on what it has decided. This is not the way to legislate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested that the setting up of the Boundary Commission was illegal. What the Secretary of State has done is in accordance with convention in these cases. After the Second Reading of a Bill which shows an intention to set up a commission or a committee of this sort, a non-statutory advisory body is set up. That is what the Secretary of State has done in this instance. The body at the moment is what one might call the Local Government Boundary Commission for England designate. It is not a statutory body. It has been set up in order to make progress quickly, and I am sure that this is what the majority of Members would wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is important
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>120</span>
and I am glad that the Minister has found it right at this juncture to refer to it. I am grateful for the way in which he has tried to be helpful to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) pinpointed the dilemma in an intervention in my speech. This Local Government Boundary Commission designate, as the Minister has described it, is to receive observations on districts and boundaries required in the context of these proposals, or the Minister will receive them and pass them to the Commission. It is important that in Tees-side, for example, where a metropolitan county is being considered, the local authorities should be asked to make their observations on boundary limitations within the new districts on a non-metropolitan county basis. Confusion is caused among local authorities and that makes it more difficult for Members to put forward recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister confirm that the Commission will not proceed with the requests, of local authorities until provisions directly affecting requests of local authorities have been considered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission cannot proceed to any finality. It receives representations. If their basis is changed in the course of our discussions, the representations will be changed. It is only a matter of convenience that all the points are being collected as quickly as possible for consideration by this body. The alternative might have been for them merely to be received by officials in my Department and shoved on the shelf until a Commission was legally appointed. I do not think that would have been the right thing to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point was not that the Commission, or its setting up, was illegal. I asked whether the hon. Gentleman could explain what constitutional authority the Commission had until the Bill is passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission is negotiating with local authorities on the subjects of district boundaries, the creation of districts, the merger of authorities. These are major matters. Because of the indecent haste with which the Bill has been put before us, they are not under the consideration of the House, but of an outside body that has no constitutional authority and whose creation has not been discussed in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>121</span>
the Committee. If a local authority were to tell the Commission that it would not co-operate because it was annoyed with the Commission's suggestions and because the Commission had no legal standing—it is not a creature of Parliament; it may be an advisory Committee, but the local authority is not obliged to deal with it—what would the Commission do without any constitutional authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be an extraordinary authority that decided not to cooperate. Local authorities are being asked to submit their own proposals, and not those of the Commission or the Government, to a body which should eventually become the Boundary Commission. If the Bill fails completely, this will have been a nullity, but it would be very unwise to leave all the consultations and representations until the Bill was through the House, and that is not in accordance with precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recollect a similar precedent. The previous Government set up the Sports Council. There are many other precedents, and the Government should get on with the job, or allow local authorities to get on with the job, and make their representations to the designate body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister equating the Boundary Commission with sports councils? Sports councils bring local authorities together for common services. Are they to be equated with boundary commissions to determine boundaries? This is a matter of profound importance. There is already a feeling among many local authorities that they are being asked to act in an illegal manner, for example, in the collection of rents. There is profound disquiet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another issue of substantial importance arising from the Minister's use of the word "advisory". What does he mean by "advisory" body? In the last Parliament, hon. Gentlemen opposite strongly urged the proposition time and time again that the proposals of Boundary Commissions were sacred and should be implemented in full. When the Minister says "advisory", does he mean that the Government reserve unto themselves the right not to accept? It is not correct to suggest that this is merely carrying on a time-honoured procedure—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are taking
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>122</span>
too long on this proposition. A whole section of the Bill is devoted to the Boundary Commission and when we reach that we may argue these matters at great length. We do not need to argue them now. The Minister should be questioned on what he has said, and we should like to hear his answers, but we cannot have speeches in between.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be quite wrong to allow a Ministerial statement on a matter of such importance to go without challenge. Whenever boundaries of local authorities are established now, the proposals have to be published, people may object, an inspector is appointed and makes recommendations. We are entitled to know how far the Government propose to differ from that. I agree that we may return to it in detail at a later stage, but as the Minister used the word "advisory", we should take the first opportunity to say that he has caused considerable disquiet among Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not encourage me to give way to him when he makes a debating speech quibbling about words. He knows perfectly well what I mean by a non-statutory advisory body. It is advisory to the Secretary of State at this stage, because the Secretary of State cannot appoint a statutory body. He does not have the power to do so until the Bill is through. But for practical, reasonable and common-sense reasons he appoints an advisory body of the same personnel as will form the statutory body in the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the statutory body is formed, it will recommend to the Secretary of State the districts throughout the country. The Secretary of State will then embody those in an Order which will come before the House. There is no question of anything being done behind the back of the House, or anything of that sort. We are providing for the local authorities to get on with the job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brynmor John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give an assurance to the Committee that the provisions of Schedule 7, particularly paragraph (2), concerned with the payment of fees, will not come into force until the Commission is set up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I now come to the speech by the hon. Member for Small Heath when he said that during the debate we had not dealt with the problems of Essex or Luton. The Amendment asks us to accept unitary authorities. Let us see how the previous Government, which proposed unitary authorities, dealt in their White Paper with the problem of Essex and the problem of Luton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They made each a unitary authority. The County of Essex, consisting of Southend-on-Sea County Borough, Chelmsford Borough, Maiden Borough, ten urban districts and about half-a-dozen rural districts, was one unitary authority. Within that unitary authority, Southend had the position of a local council, not even the powers of a parish council, but a sort of voluntary advisory powers, and it would have been on the same footing as, for example, Braintree and Bocking in the same area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Luton County Borough was in the unitary authority of Luton and West Herts: Luton County Borough, Dunstable Borouph, Hemel Hempstead Borough, St. Albans Borough, Watford Borough, six urban districts, and six rural districts. Among all those, Luton would have had a population of 155,000 in a unitary authority of 707,000. Luton would have had the powers of an advisory local council. That is how the previous Government dealt with the problem of Luton. Luton would have had no more power as a separate body within that unitary authority than, for example, Chorleywood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I put this directly to the mayor, the leader, the town clerk and all the representatives of Luton this morning, may I tell the Minister what they thought of our proposals of 1970? They said they should have been unitary area no. 49, that that was reasonably acceptable to them and preferable to the present Government's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished. I am certain that it could not have been preferable to the people of Luton to be put in that position within a unitary authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Small Heath said that eventually there must be regional or provincial governments. He said that they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>124</span>
must not be answerable only to the Minister but must be organised on a democratic basis. He must surely be aware that the work of the regional authorities as we see them at the moment and as they are working at the moment is a combined effort between the regional economic planning councils, bodies set up by the previous Government, and the standing conferences of local planning authorities. Therefore, the local authorities are part and parcel of what we see as the temporary regional administration of the present time until the Crowther Commission reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member said that he did not know how the Government knew what the Crowther Commission would report. He suggested that there was something secret between the Government and the Crowther Commission. I refer him to paragraph 36 of the Local Government in England White Paper, Command 4584, which states:
	<br><q><p>"For this reason, the Government's conclusion regarding the operational local authorities do not depend on or conflict with the mattters now under consideration by the Commission on the Constitution, whose Chairman, Lord Crowther, has informed the Government that, so far as can be envisaged, there is not likely to be anything in their report to warrant any delay in proceeding with the reform of local government below provincial level."</p></q>
There is nothing secret about this. Lord Crowther has said that our reforms do not depend on, or conflict with, what may be contained in his report. Indeed, the right hon. Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland), speaking of local government reform, said in the debate on the White Paper:
	<br><q><p>"Secondly, it is not in question that the matter is urgent."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th May. 1971; Vol. 817, 	<i>c.</i> 1293.]</p></q>
We used to hear a great deal about waiting for Crowther, or for the Green Paper on finance. I had prepared certain effective quotations from what the right hon. Gentleman has said in the past, but in view of his handsome statement today on the subject, I shall tear them up and merely congratulate him on an intelligent conversion to what we were saying last year—and that is from the hon. Gentleman's leader, the right hon. Member for Grimsby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no question of delaying the Bill until the Crowther Committee reports. It is a matter which we should proceed with urgently, and I hope that

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment it will be convenient to take Amendment No. 3 in page 1, line 10, leave out second "counties" and insert "provinces", and Amendment No. 6, in page 12, leave out subsection (2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue of provinces has already been referred to by one of my hon. Friends, and the Minister has commented on it. However, this is such an important issue that we ought to examine it more carefully and understand more clearly the Government's intentions. The Amendment is a probing Amendment, with that purpose in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am well aware that the Minister may refer me to the Government White Paper in which it was pointed out that
	<br><q><p>"The Government agree with the Redcliffe-Maud Commission in thinking that areas of this size"</p></q>
referring to regions or provinces, as have been proposed
	<br><q><p>"would be too large to be appropriate for the operation of local government services."</p></q>
However, the Redcliffe-Maud Report, while making that comment with respect to the province as not being of the right size for operation of local government services, goes on to say:
	<br><q><p>"The purposes for which we think that a provincial council is essential as part of the total structure of local government will be</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>126</span>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 17, Noes 23.</p>
	<p>	<br><q><p>best served by a body elected by the main authorities."</p></q></p>
	<p>I still hold the view which favours direct election. Nevertheless, the Redcliffe-Maud Report did not throw away the idea of provincial councils, as might be thought to. have been the case from the reference in the White Paper. Indeed, Redcliffe-Maud made clear that it did envisage what might almost be regarded as a skeleton provision for regional or provincial councils and indicated at least some of the functions which they might perform.</p>
	<p>There is no surprise in that. Many of the bodies that gave evidence to the Redcliffe-Maud Commission stressed their strong conviction that a province or region was needed in the reform of local government. I greatly regret that this does not appear in the Bill. Indeed, I regard as a major fault of the Bill the fact that it does not so appear, although I must confess that I have no confidence that my own Government in the past would have included it either. I made clear at the time my anxiety about that matter, so I am maintaining a position which I have taken and have held for some years.</p>
	<p>Some of the more important bodies made clear their support for the whole concept of a provincial authority, including the Association of Municipal Corporations, who thought that there should be some 11 to 16, and Nalgo, from the staff side, who thought there might well be 10, while the Town and Country
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>127</span>
Planning Association thought that there might be any number from 12 to 20 provinces or regions. I should declare, not a pecuniary interest, but an interest in the last-named body, as I am chairman of their council. Those associations are recognised as having considered carefully the broad problems of local government, and their views are worthy of consideration. For that reason, it is not surprising that the Redcliffe-Maud Commission recommended that such provinces or regions should be established, with certain limited but important duties to perform.</p>
	<p>Those duties included the preparation of strategic plans for the whole area or region with which they were concerned, and suggested certain major transport and other duties which they might take on, as well as suggesting that they might well take over the responsibilities for the established regional economic and planning councils. Thus, instead of being the ad hoc bodies of today, they might become part of the whole reorganisation of local government.</p>
	<p>Others have strongly recommended that they should be given even wider responsibilities. For example, it has been argued, I think sensibly, that provinces or regions—in my view, directly elected, although there might well be some appointed additions to them—should have responsibilities in connection with the regional planning of the health services, for example, again taking over from the existing ad hoc bodies. In that respect, one is again concerned about the form which the Government's proposals are likely to take. It appears that we are to be presented with another kind of regional ad hoc statutory body which is not directly influenced in any democratic way. Naturally, my hon. Friends and I wish to raise that point.</p>
	<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>Many of us will have seen in the province or regional authority an opportunity for the important extension, rather than a diminution, of democratic representation. We saw the possibility not only of those bodies taking over some of the functions of the great range of ad hoc bodies that have been established by all Governments in post-war years, but of certain functions being delegated to them from central government, for ex-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>128</span>
ample with respect to the question of industrial location. It seemed quite feasible that they might be given a responsibility previously centrally exercised. There were many other, in my view, quite exiciting possibilities of further development of that sort.</p>
	<p>The anxiety of many of my hon. Friends and myself is the anxiety expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell), in winding up discussion on the previous Amendment. It is recognised by both sides of the Committee, and by the Government, that the structure of local government as it is to be established will not be able to deal with many of the wider problems in planning. There must be some new method established for dealing with problems, for example, outside the area of the new tightly drawn metropolitan county authorities in order to reconcile their interests with those of the wider country areas.</p>
	<p>The Minister, during the Second Reading debate, appeared to take the view that there was a particular value in drawing the boundaries more narrowly in the Bill than in the White Paper in order to make even more intense the argument between the urban authorities and the county authorities. No doubt this argument will produce new ideas, but our experience of local government since the war, and indeed before it, has shown how difficult progress becomes with this kind of continuing conflict.</p>
	<p>All the Minister was able to offer at that time was the suggestion that there would have to be set up, if the Bill goes through in its present form, all kinds of co-ordinating committees. Most of us know what that amounts to. It will be impossible to make progress until every one of the authorities is agreed, which can spread over many years. Stultification will result from this sort of procedure.</p>
	<p>But we have more than a suspicion. There are justifiable anxieties that what the Minister really has in mind is not so much that these co-ordinating committes, when they are established, will do much good, but that he intends to strengthen the ministerial regional apparatus that will knock people's heads together and enforce solutions of all kinds on a regional basis. We are not to have any kind of democratic regional representation; we are to have the Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>129</span>
taking powers autocratically in order to resolve problems which, in my view and in the view of my hon. Friends, ought to be settled in a democratic way.</p>
	<p>This, I fear, is the intention, and the argument for it is made on the ground of efficiency. For example, there is to be a regional plan for the South-East. We admire the quality and the work which has been put into that plan, which is to be implemented by the Minister. His own directee is to ensure that that plan is carried out, but it will lack any kind of democratic organisation to do this work.</p>
	<p>These are the issues about which we are entitled to know a great deal from the Government. Examples can be taken from a number of different parts of the country. I refer to the area I know best—the North-East. None of the proposals made by successive Governments with regard to the North-East has been satisfactory. They have not even remotely come near to overcoming the difficulty of the large rural area of Northumberland being attached to the urban area of Tyneside. This is the reality. The two serve each other. Northumberland stretches up to the border of Scotland, with the northernmost tip having more affinity with Scotland than it does with England.</p>
	<p>The solution attempted both by the last Government and by the present Government seems to me and to many of us to be wholly unsatisfactory. Even with the Amendments that have been made by the Government in the Bill as against the White Paper, we are still left with a county which is largely ineffectual and relatively huge, and we are left with a completely separated urban area of Tyneside and Wearside.</p>
	<p>Administratively there are all sorts of argument that can be made out for this, but both Redcliffe-Maud and indeed, I believe, the Ministry, have argued strongly in favour of linking urban with rural authorities in order to get a proper appreciation of a solution. They have said—and I think it is absolutely true; it is argued in great detail and at length in the Redcliffe-Maud Report, and I do not think it has ever been challenged—that today in our society the townsman looks out into the country for a great deal of his activity, and equally the countryman looks into the town. The idea that these are completely isolated and separate bodies is untrue, if
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>130</span>
I can say so without offence to my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson).</p>
	<p>It has been agreed, therefore, that there is more that is in common than there is that separates them today, and this will be so increasingly, because everyone is far more mobile and the townsman is looking out to the country for his leisure activities and much else—indeed, many are going out to live in rural parts within reach of the towns—and the separation and isolation is not so real. Therefore, we should surely be building up our pattern of local government to fit the reality and not fit something that was true years and years ago.</p>
	<p>I find it a bit extraordinary that quite a number of hon. Members opposite who at one time were devout supporters, apparently, of the idea of regional authorities of one sort or another, seem to have become as silent as the grave and not a word has come from their lips in the last few months on this subject. We shall see whether they remain as silent as the grave in the future.</p>
	<p>Here in the North-East we have this specific example—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully, particularly in these discussions about the North-East of England and Northumbria. Is my hon. Friend arguing here for non-metropolitan counties, and does he wish them to include that fine part of Northumberland in the Tyneside? Is he in divergence here with the Government's plans?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure my hon. Friend that I have been in divergence on this subject, as most of my right hon. and hon. Friends know, with nearly all the plans that have been proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think Derek Senior, who put the minority report to the Commission, came nearest to what I would regard as a sane solution. The only way of dealing with this—as indeed, I believe, in other parts of the country; I do not suggest that this is the only example, but it is perhaps the clearest—is that, for broad planning purposes at least, we should have an authority covering something near to the old area of Northumbria which, as my hon. Friend will recognise, did go down to the Humber. Something of this order is required for sane broad planning purposes and major transport matters of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>131</span>
I am afraid that any attempt to squeeze an area like Northumberland and Tyneside into the kind of pattern which was being imposed on us either by this Bill or indeed, by previous White Papers, is unsatisfactory and is not likely to live long. It is bound, in time, to be replaced by some more satisfactory provision. I cannot see why we cannot consider the needs and requirements of a province, and discuss the kind of functions that the province might properly carry out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another advantage of including a province, even in a skeleton condition, as a framework, is that one might well be able to build upon it the wider authority, including some devolution from the centre that I hope the Government intend. My anxieties are aroused by statements recently made by the Department. I hope I am wrong, but the Department seem to have in mind the strengthening of its own departmental regional organisation, using that to enforce regional patterns that suit itself, and some of the programmes that have been worked out by groups of expert planners. I have a great admiration for the work of experts, but I want to see this work subjected to some effective democratic control. I am willing to argue and discuss how that control can best be exercised. It is a proper matter for discussion. I fear that by excluding from the Bill any provision for a province we are denying ourselves the opportunity for the healthy development that the country urgently needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.0 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always argued in favour of the grass roots organisations, the parish, and so on, and no doubt we shall come to those later. I have also argued for an effective organisation covering very wide areas indeed. Only in that way will we fight the dangers of central bureaucracy, get some devolution, and take over from some of the statutory 	<i>ad hoc-ery</i> that has developed in recent years, and for which we all share some responsibility. If we want to encourage people to regard the reorganisation of local government as something more than a mere paper exercise, and if we want to stir people to a new interest in local government and regional affairs, there is a danger of that being stultified right from the start by a rejection of promising fresh development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have put down the Amendments hoping that we can hear from the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>132</span>
how he sees the problem at the planning level, wider than the urban authorities that he has established, or wider than the rural authorities that he will establish in his new counties. How will he deal with the matter, and ensure that there is some real democratic voice in the argument, if he rejects, as completely as I fear he does, the whole concept of province or region.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's Amendment is very important. He described it as a probing Amendment, but I hope that he will consider it a paving Amendment. If we can at this stage get an Amendment of this sort accepted we can go far to develop the reorganisation and reform of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has been described as a fundamental review of local government, the sort of thing which happens only once in a century. It would be tragic, therefore, if in such a fundamental review of local government we failed to provide for government at the provincial level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I may discuss briefly our experience of local authority organisation at provincial level. The Minister has already referred to the economic planning councils and the standing conference of local authorities, which are the 	<i>ad hoc</i>-ery to which my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) referred and which we have had to string together in the absence of any proper provincial authorities. I should like to refer to some of the functions which could usefully be given to such provinces if the Committee accepts the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most fruitful developments in the sphere of regional activity introduced by the last Administration was the setting up of the regional economic planning councils. Before we were ready to move to a reform of local government this was a valuable step but, now that we are to reform local government, to leave them in and not introduce the province would create all sorts of further difficulties for ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the North-West, which is an area I know best, we shall have four authorities. I understand that I am not allowed to call them top-tier authorities: I suppose they must be called outer-sphere, or upper-sphere authorities. I am referring to the county councils and the metropolitan county authorities. These are the four planning authorities which will be responsible for the North-West at the level
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>133</span>
of the strategy plan which they will form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will those plans be co-ordinated? Will it be by means of each authority nominating people to the planning council, or by a Minister selecting from the authorities those whom he thinks fit? While it was inevitable when we had the patchwork quilt of local government, I suggest that such a proposal would not now be satisfactory and would be bound to create jealousies and ill feelings between authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shall we have a planning council and, parallel with it, a standing conference of local authorities? Ministers of the present Government; like those in the previous Administration, know that relationships between economic planning councils and standing conferences of local authorities have not been easy over the years. There have been periods of great difficulty in getting them to work together satisfactorily. If we are to move to a situation where there will be only three or four local authorities at strategic planning level in a region, is there to be a standing conference between the four of them and a planning council as well?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may again refer to the experience of the North-West. During the past six years, in spite of the existence of a fairly successful planning council, we have not been able to develop a satisfactory regional strategy because of the absence of a provincial tier of government. We have had documents prepared by the regional economic planning council—strategy 1, strategy 2, strategy 2a, strategy 2b, strategy 3, and so on. The Minister himself chaired a meeting in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. Fitch) at which the planning council, the standing conference of local authorities and the Department commissioned yet another co-ordinating strategic study. These 	<i>ad hoc</i> arrangements have proved unsatisfactory in the past, and provide the case for having an authority at the level of the province which can deal with the essential decisions on land-use planning, industrial policy or industrial development and which cannot be looked at in an area such as the North-West at the level of one local authority, even by the new county councils which will need essential overall provincial co-ordination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke a moment ago about the ques-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>134</span>
tion of the regional economic planning councils. Under the Administration of my right hon. and hon. Friends there was another development which was useful and which paved the way for provincial government along the lines referred to in the Amendment, namely, the creation of the regional economic planning boards—the mini-Whitehalls. This was a valuable innovation. It ensured that for the first time departmental officials in a region spoke together on a regular basis and the strengthening of the Department of the Environment staffs in the regions is, in its way, a valuable trend in this direction if, and only if, we can establish at the provincial level a system of government to which these developing new bureaucracies can have some relationship and to which they can in some measure be responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to consider a few of the areas in which the system which we are considering in this Bill will not provide adequate co-ordination and for which more coordination at the level of the provincial council is required. I have already referred to strategic planning, industrial development and strategic decisions on land use. Another matter about which I know a little is the question of the development of co-ordination in higher and further education. In the last few years we have seen developments of our polytechnics and below them we have our colleges of further education and universities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that provincial councils would administer or would be executively responsible for such institutions. But I think it would be worth while, a Redcliffe-Maud suggested in the chapter on provinces, at the level of a province to have something—and I believe it was in the evidence to the Rob-bins Committee that Professor Mackenzie put this forward—to have a body equivalent to a regional university grants committee which would be able to look over a province and look at the activities of the polytechnics and the universities and the departments of advanced further education and ensure that there was a proper co-ordination, development, and use of the capital resources of these different institutions within an area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a practical field where at the moment there is inadequate co-ordination and where a provincial authority could,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

I believe, play a most useful part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Goronwy Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene in a most thoughtful speech—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I cannot hear what he is saying, although I am sure that it is in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised and flattered, Sir Stephen. In considering the role of regional or provincial councils in higher education, namely the universities, the comparable institutions and the applied scientific and artistic colleges such as teacher colleges, I ask my hon. Friend not to rule out control, both financial and managerial, on a regional basis for what is increasingly being regarded as a regional complex of university and further education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend tempts me to go further in this direction. The problems of the control of higher education is a delicate matter which we shall be able to discuss later. However, I was hinting at this stage at something along the lines of a regional grants committee, not restricted to the, universities but covering the universities, the polytechnics and other institutions, not controlled in too dictatorial a way but able to carry out, as the University Grants Committee is increasingly doing, a certain co-ordinatory role in the development of higher and advanced further education which is of increasing importance as the facilities for higher and further education become increasingly developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South Shields referred to some of our nationalised industries—electricity and gas industries, and the Post Office—which are now beginning to operate at regional level. Regional boards certainly exist at present for the electricity industry, and still exist for the gas industry although I believe that there may be some future changes in its structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also referred to hospitals, but, with respect to the industries which I have cited would it not be appropriate that the activities of these regional boards should not fall within the purview of provincial authorities such as have been described? This would bring back the direct democratic control of these great sections of our national life, many of which were local-authority controlled until
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>136</span>
1947, when they were taken into public ownership. Thus, if the Amendment is accepted, when we discuss in more detail the functions of our provincial councils I hope that we may find ways of ensuring that the electricity industry and other of our nationalised industries can be appropriately linked with the provincial councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could and should go further than that, without straying beyond; the remit of the Amendment. Quite dearly, many regions and provinces need a stimulus to their economic growth and development. Thus I believe that many of the provincial authorities of the type under discussion would do more than merely carry out research and studies. They would be equipped with the powers and finance to stimulate and develop industry within those provinces, many of which at present are sadly in need of new industry and new jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This would not be assuming certain of the general powers of central Government. We should be able to go further than merely producing a marvellous plan, as our economic planning councils do at present, saying, "This is what we would like to happen". We would ensure that there were provincial councils with the power, perhaps with institutions such as the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation in their regions, to ensure the development of new forms of public enterprise—with, in some cases, mixed companies such as the National Bus Company and the Leyland plant, in Cumberland. They would be mixed public-private enterprises, forming new insertions of economic growth into our regions and provinces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are not matters which should be decided and controlled by people in the Department of Trade and Industry, or any other Department. They are things which could and should be usefully done, in order to create new industries and jobs in the provinces of the country, by the provincial councils spoken of by my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember having an argument with an elderly alderman for a county borough about the passenger transport authorities, when they were first proposed, in 1967 or 1968, by my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle). He was complaining of the ways in which central
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>137</span>
Government were always taking things away from his distinguished county borough. He said that in 1945 and in 1950 the electricity and gas undertakings were taken away, as were the hospitals and other institutions which had been the pride of his local authority. Subsequently, he said, the police had been taken away, and now the buses and trams were to be taken away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have a chance not to take functions away from local government, but to create a structure by which at provincial level we may ensure that control over some of these functions can go back to our regions, to our provinces, to a much more satisfactory form of democratic control. I hope that the Committee will support the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop). He says that it is a probing Amendment; I hope that it becomes a paving Amendment for the Government. This is clearly not an official Opposition amendment; it is a back bench Amendment, suggested in order that we may discuss the future possibilities of local government because of a Bill supposed to be designed to create a new structure of local government for decades to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must tell us whether they consider that there is a role for a structure of government above that of county and metropolitan area and beneath that of Government. Nationalised industries form themselves almost automatically into natural regions which would form provinces. The B.B.C., too, forms itself into similar natural regions, so does the I.T.A. Private industry is tending to do the same; it has a north-west division, a north-east division, a south-west division. All these bodies outside local government are themselves creating provincial areas. There is a need for it; it is a natural growth, a natural development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government themselves are concerned with a regional programme, for as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) said, what they are concerned with is not a democratic regional programme, but a bureaucratic regional programme, authority answerable not to the area concerned, but to the Minister in London. Do not the Government now consider
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
that there is a need for a democratic structure at provincial level to perform functions for which there has often been no organisation in the past? This is the Bill by which such a structure should be created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have criticised the Bill as incompetent. It is. It is a Bill of unhappy compromises. It is a rushed, hasty Bill. Worse still, it is a myopic Bill. It doss not look to the future at all. It tries to re-structure and re-create the local government of the nineteenth century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Government to consider some of the functions that such provincial bodies ought to have. There are gaping holes in the Bill because there is no structure at provincial level. I will instance some of the functions that are clearly mentioned in the wrong place as pages of 	<i>ad hoc</i>-ery—my hon. Friend's beautiful words—or not mentioned at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Water is one of our most precious resources. It is a subject with which we must concern ourselves at national level, at provincial level, and at district level, because the supply is not endless, as many people imagine. We are quickly reaching the stage when our water supplies may well be in jeopardy. Where does the Bill put responsibility for water? Not even at metropolitan country level, not at ordinary county level: it puts it at district level, the worst level for this responsibility. The responsibility of river boards as well as local authorities, the interconnection of one county and another, the fact that most authorities have to transport their water over long distances and other authorities' territory, but within the same region, clearly make water a subject demanding overall supervision by some form of provincial structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly with sewerage responsibilities. One of the greatest dangers facing the country in the closing years of this century will be pollution: we shall kill ourselves with our own waste products. This forward-looking Bill puts responsibility for sewerage at district level—not at metropolitan county level, not at county level, but at district level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One therefore has a structure of river boards responsible for the water supply and for sewerage and each little district responsible for its own sewerage scheme. That is no improvement at all on what we have now. Water and sewerage, as rivers and terrain are involved, should not be

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>139</span>
dealt with at district level. They should not even be dealt with at county level. They should be dealt with at a much higher level, at a provincial level, or possibly a national level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If newspaper reports are correct, I believe that the Secretary of State had some difficulty with the Cabinet about this matter. This is one issue on which I support the Secretary of State, because at least on that he was progressive. Our water resources are not endless. There must be far greater control and far greater foresight about how we use our water in future. We are not able to pollute our rivers and coastal waters endlessly. There ought to be concern about these matters at a much higher level than district level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For an example of what happens because we do not have any provincial level hon. Members should look at Clause 175. Subsections (1) and (2) deal with the functions, ascribing them to district level. Subsections (3) to (12) deal with 	<i>ad hoc</i>-ery, with joint boards. Because the district level is clearly the wrong level, they deal with one district joining with another, joining with a county, or with a river board. In a Bill to reform local government we find that sort of provision. Clause 175 provides for the setting up of a whole host of 	<i>ad hoc</i> boards to deal with essential services such as water supply and sewerage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only is that subject mishandled in the Bill. Industrial development planning is not dealt with. That is increasingly a function of local government. In the north of England, as the Minister knows very well, the survival of many towns depends on local authorities attracting industry and providing facilities for it. That has become very much a local government function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there should be co-ordination, and that co-ordination should properly come from a provincial council. A provincial council is the natural body, because the economic development councils now cover districts of the same kind. But it is not only for attracting industry; it is a body which does not just administer but instigates actions in a region, develops it and makes it different from other regions. That is the kind of level at which a provincial council or some provincial structure could be of enormous assistance to reviving regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>140</span>
For example, there are those who are for and those who are against the idea of a Morecambe barrage scheme. But, clearly, some level of local government, democratically elected, at provincial level, is the obvious body to deal with such a project. A barrage across Morecambe Bay would affect not only Lancashire and Cumbria but Merseyside. The hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed) could tell us that the shores and sands of Southport, which would be in the Merseyside metropolitan area, and the whole ecology of that coast would be affected by a massive barrage across Morecambe Bay. Other local authorities would be involved, such as, Greater Manchester which in all probability would then get water from Morecambe Bay and not have to rape the Lake District for a water supply. All the authorities in the North-West are, and must be, concerned with such a project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could an 	<i>ad hoc</i> body of every authority in the North-West of England deal with such a scheme? Such a body would never get off its feet, and possibly that is why these exciting new projects never get off the ground. So many people have to deal with them that by the time all the bodies involved have been considered it is too late to start, or all the energy and impetus have gone. A provincial council or a provincial structure could deal with such projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have instanced Morecambe Bay because I come from the North-West. The Wash is another typical example where a number of authorities are involved. Norfolk, Humberside and Cambridgeshire would all be involved in such a project. Could an eastern provincial council get this on its feet and impel local authorities to do something about it? We want that kind of initiative in local government today. It would attract more people to vote in local government elections, to take a greater pride in their own region and in how their region differed from other regions in development projects, as well as in type, characteristics, and so on.

Another subject—obviously a provincial subject—on which the Bill is silent is airports, which are not mentioned in the Bill. The Government are in a difficulty because they do not know where to put them as there is no level. My hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>141</span>
the Member for South Shields talked of the provincial level. Manchester Airport is the airport not for Manchester, or even for Greater Manchester, but for Northwest England. What do the Government intend to do about airports—to leave them in the control of the British Airports Authority, with no democratic control? If one has the misfortune to live near an airport, one knows how painful it is to have no democratic representation on the Airports Authority to which one can complain of airport noise. Apart from the environmental aspect, there is the development aspect. Where do airports belong? The proper level for airports is the provincial level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should say at which level of local government they intend to put such projects as those I have outlined in my speech. There is a need somewhere for such a structure, and I suggest that that structure be at provincial level, and that this be a paving Amendment for the Government to say that this is not a party political matter, that there should be such a structure and such a level, and that they intend to create it somewhere in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that light, hon. Members on this side of the Committee, and I hope hon. Gentlemen opposite, will continue to press the Minister to tell us the Government's intentions on this serious and important aspect of local government, which is not of the past or the present, but of vital concern to the future of the regions and the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the course of our proceedings we will discuss many issues and many principles. If one could work up any emotion or raise any fervour on any one of those issues or principles, this is it. It lies at the centre of most of the problems we encounter in western industrialised society, the kind or organisation we have and the workings of democracy in a highly modern and specialised age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the local government problems encountered in the past which have prompted this Government and past Governments to bring forward solutions have arisen because, if democracy is represented as a triangle with the base at local government level, over the years that base has shrunk until the triangle has become inverted. Democracy cannot work like that. People feel remote from the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>142</span>
position of power where the vast majority of decisions affecting their daily lives are taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is concern, too, with bureaucracy. As day succeeds day we find, as individuals, that those that govern us and the organisations running our lives are reducing us to very small cogs in a growing complexity of industrial and governmental machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One would have hoped that, confronted with that kind of problem, any Government—I should have preferred it to have been the previous Government, although I even have hopes of this Government—would have looked at it in a more profound way, and come up with the kind of solution that could refashion our democracy and make it the living thing that we all want it to be. If people today feel remote from Government, it is because they are far more knowledgeable, they know what goes on at the centre, and they feel that they should be able to participate. As has already been said, people in a society like that in Britain today can play a part, and feel involved in all affairs within the community if we devolve a whole range of powers from central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of the years, central Government has taken away an increasing amount of power from the local authorities. Before I came to the House I worked for the Central Electricity Generating Board, which was made up of municipal undertakings and various other local bodies, formed into one large central body. Over the years it was found economically, organisationally, administratively and in strictly human terms more profitable and beneficial to the industry to break it down, as my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) mentioned, into regional components. The same goes for the Gas Council, and for a variety of other bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One would have hoped, with the already existing components within the framework of Government, that these could have been built on by Government. I certainly hoped so six years ago, when I wrote a paper on the proposition that we evolve a regional industrial policy—a paper which I sent to one who was then a very senior Labour Government Minister, a man receptive to new ideas. I thought that it would attract his attention, that maybe something would click, and that he would do something about it. Six
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>143</span>
years ago the subjects of devolution and regionalism were much in fashion. Everybody talked of them, and even the Tory Party set up a constitutional commission to look at the problems of Scotland, though I do not know what happened to it. At that time everybody—young people, particularly—was concerned about the form of Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sent off that document, which called for the establishment of regional industrial boards. I scrapped the regional employment premium and all other forms of regional aid, and gave a block grant to regional boards, composed of directly elected members who could say what they thought was best for their regions, and go about the job of spending the grant as they thought fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Wash and the Morecambe Bay schemes have been mentioned. One could go up and down the country listing various projects of a regional character that will only get off the ground when they are fully backed at regional level. And why not? Does Whitehall always know best? I doubt it. Whitehall today is far too remote, far too bound up with statistics and the 	<i>minutiae</i> of economic activity. As we have discovered in the past 18 months, even the Treasury, the fount of all economic wisdom, is not right, and has not been right for the whole of that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chances are that if one could devolve far greater economic power one would be more likely to get social involvement at that level, which would in turn create a kind of economic activity, possibly something of a revolution, to stimulate the regions and bring them to a level of prosperity over the country as a whole, with one region equal to another. I can see no hope for regions like Scotland, certain parts of Wales, the North-East or the North-West whilst central Government is predominantly responsible for their economic affairs. The laws of economics being what they are, particularly with entry to the Common Market, things tend to drift towards the centre. If a community wants to safeguard its standard of living and remain in the place it regards as home, the rest of the community should give it the wherewithal to maintain that standard of living, be it industrially, educationally, or in the local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government, even at this late hour, could bring forth some proposal at
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>144</span>
that level, it would galvanise public opinion as local government has never been able to in the past. Equally, if we had looked at that area of Government first, evolving a system appropriate to the needs of the day, and then looked backwards down the chain, we would not now have the Bill, because it does not fit in with provincial ideas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry I have missed much of my hon. Friend's speech, but I have been fascinated by his last few sentences. I echo all that he has said about the desire of people to be involved. If one goes into a pub anywhere, one will find the expert who knows far more than he or I on these matters—of course. Would the hon. Gentleman care to comment on the report of the late Arthur Skeffington, which dealt with all these matters, and gave all hon. Members on this side food for thought on participation and local government? It was a major contribution to the movement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree. If I were to pick an example which would suitably illustrate my hon. Friend's point I would quote hotel development in London. I am sure that if the people of London were able to voice their opinion about how London should be developed, they would come down very firmly against the idea of building huge hotel and office blocks throughout the city. This has a lot to do with planning, even though some hon. Members opposite may not agree. That is precisely what we are talking about—democracy and the form one's community should take. The essence of the argument today is the kind of educational system, transport system and industrial policy we should have. Why should not the community have something to say about these things? The kind of democracy that we all believe in would be much weakened if ordinary people did not play their part and had their say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the essence of democracy. It is not something that stands still in time. It has to evolve. I am only sorry that there is nothing new in the Bill. It does not move to meet new events, new circumstances and new situations. Therefore, having made this case for the provincial council and listened to what my hon. Friends have had to say on the same subject, I hope that the Minister will consider it, and that in the very near future
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>145</span>
he will indicate that he regards the proposition as being useful. I trust that before this Committee finishes we shall have the Government's views on paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that if my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson) is planning to make an intervention he might take into account that I might reach the point of asking for time for the Chairman's chop so that I can consider over some refreshment how best to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not in conflict, oddly enough, with the first official Opposition Amendment. Indeed, we are consistent, in pursuing a general theme and a general approach to the major principles of local government which have been accepted both by Redcliffe-Maud and, incidentally, by Mr. Senior, who produced a minority report. As with any problem in this country where local government, to be ungrammatical, "growed" in a muddled sort of way, the function of central Government in attempting to bring some rationale ito the business is bound to be very difficult indeed. There is no doubt that the large number of conflicting interests within the present large number of local authorities—indeed, the fragmentation of local government life throughout the United Kingdom—is something which has to be corrected, and we are concerned with how best to correct it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to say something which has not yet been clearly said, and it is in connection with my remarks about fragmentation. The essence of any provincial council is to accept as a first premise of an examination of local government reorganisation this simple fact—that the problems now facing local government are wider than the limits of the units appropriate for the operation of services. In other words, it is clear that there is a factor in terms of the history of the development of local government which has been brought home to us more clearly since the last war. Beyond the limits that I have referred to there were population problems, mobility, and the involvement of local government in economic and current questions. There are increasing at such a rate that we can no longer afford the continuance of the fragmented
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>146</span>
system and we are bound to have some reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) has done a service to the Committee in bringing forward this probing Amendment. Thoughtful men on both sides of the Committee have been enabled to examine the new functions of local government with its population problems and economic and national planning considerations. We have been able to test whether the Government are willing to review their rigid posture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir Stephen, I have had a thought. It came upon me like a flash of light on the road to Damascus. I hardly dare convey its significance to the Committee, because I want to bring it in, as it were, in my peroration at our next sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second consideration arises from my submission. There is a growing need for a representative body capable of devising a strategy for large areas. This strategy must inevitably take into account the broad and general economic problems, the problems of total land use and the framework for the development policies within which the operational authorities can best work. The concept of a province falls into line with the changing functions of local authorities and becomes imperative because of the fragmentation and the limitations to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
County boroughs with long histories of looking after their own affairs have a continuing role which makes sense, but in the context of the Bill it may make no sense. Earlier I referred to the discrimination between metropolitan and non-metropolitan boroughs. A larger area in the form of a province might take account of some of these functions. The first would be strategic planning, but not the preparation of development or structure plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to notice the significance of this statement. It must deal with strategic planning, but the structural plans and the detailed plans must be left to the other authorities. I agree with Mr. Senior and others that such plans are best dealt with by metropolitan borough authorities. Another function is higher education. Advanced higher education is best dealt with over a larger area, so that universities, colleges of advanced technology, polytechnics and teacher-training colleges can be deployed in such a way as to make national sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>147</span>
A provincial organisation would have the ability to organise the police in a way which the police authorities would welcome. However, I think that the fourth needs some special attention, in particular because of the increasing congestion on our highways. In this context I refer to the tragedy which occurred only yesterday. There is a need at provincial level for an inter-provincial strategic planning role to consider major inter-urban highways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly communications must rank high in the minds of those who are concerned with the reorganisation of local government. Also in this context, more sense must be made of the planning of aerodromes in the United Kingdom. Provincial councils could plan, again in concert with the Government, a national strategy which makes more sense than the struggles which often occur between local authorities in their claims in respect of small airports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also consider the major recreational and cultural projects which are designed to serve a region. Often large amounts of public money are wasted. Indeed, proposals in this respect are delayed because of the difficulties of so many interested smaller authorities in trying to find the right forum in which to achieve regional sense in the field of recreational and cultural projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question that major sewage and refuse disposal facilities must be tackled on a regional or provincial level. Perhaps we might also consider the importance of the problems of pollution, of the need to clean our rivers and, where it applies in the provincial boundaries, the protection of our coastline. It is rather a sad reflection—it may perhaps not be known to some members of the Committee—that the question of cleaning our beaches is often based on a mutual agreement or mutual aid scheme between authorities of different counties. Sometimes their inability to deal with oil pollution in the right way, or to provide the appropriate forms of protection, requires urgent attention. Thus, a provincial council strategy to deal with the problems of pollution, with the cleanliness of our beaches and rivers, as well as with our drainage system and the supply of water, makes considerable sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We require, in such a principle as my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields has outlined, to co-ordinate our fire services. However, I urge that that should
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
not be at local level. There are many examples of first-class, efficient local fire brigades, whose capability through their existing staffs and personnel disciplines indicate that there could be no improvement in the local area, as far as the fire service is concerned. However, there is a need for general regional co-ordination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also believe that we should have special services for children, as well as for the elderly and handicapped—services which are needed for a wider area and over a very large population. As a young councillor I was much concerned to learn of one of the problems of providing services for spastic children. For instance, where there were four or five spastic children in a localised area it was impossible, on economic grounds, to provide the buildings for trained personnel and the other requirements for giving spastic children the proper attention. Those services could only be provided in respect of a larger number of children over a larger area. We should study this important problem on the basis of defining a strategy in this field. This can be done only if councils have authority over a wider area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.0 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I served, much to my pleasure, as it turned out, on the Committee that considered the Transport Bill. The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment was also a member. We were in conflict on many occasions. But now that he is in office, I think that he would not disagree that there is a need to consider nationally the planning of passenger transport services. The need is greater where some of these services appear to be passing out of the hands of commercial undertakings, or in rural areas where services are being cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential rôle of a provincial council would be the specialist needs of the Health Service. In my constituency proposals for the building of a district hospital are being considered. Such a provincial council able to consider such proposals would make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provincial council idea corresponds with my suggestion about Teesside. The Senior Minority Report's proposals for districts with borough or metropolitan status make sense. Grouping Teesside, Hartlepool and Darlington makes sense in that there would be a population of some
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0088">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>149</span>
940,000 people by 1981 and the services that these boroughs have enjoyed for a considerable time could be enhanced by the creation of a provincial council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, too, that the Minister will consider what has come to my notice—I hope that he will not regard this as an allegation—that the Bill appears to be too political. In my constituency there is the deepest suspicion that the boundaries have been drawn and amended after certain discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, I wanted the Minister to note that others who have looked with care at the Bill appear to feel that whereas
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>150</span>
we have tried to deploy a principle of creating local and provincial boundaries which make sense—and I will not repeat the criteria within which we claim we have made sense—there is the deepest suspicion that some of the boundaries have been drawn and altered since February taking into account political considerations.
