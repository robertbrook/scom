	<div class='page-header'><h1>TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (AMENDMENT) BILL [LORDS]</h1></div>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 4</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>AMENDMENTS AS RESPECTS GREATER LONDON AND NEIGHBOURING AREAS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>—(	<i>25th April</i>)—That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also discussing new Clause No. 2—	<i>Amendments as respects planning for London—</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
and the new Schedule—	<i>REPLACEMENT FOR SCHEDULE 4 TO ACT OF 1971</i> "SCHEDULE 4 SURVEYS AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS IN GREATER LONDON</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by thanking the Minister for giving us a further opportunity to consider further what appears to be a major re-casting of the Schedule. We have had some time to examine it and have consultations about it. Unquestionably differences of opinion and anxieties have arisen about it, although the broad intention of the Amendments is welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confess that I had not realised that in London the Minister does not have the power to approve in part or whole, with or without modifications, that he has for the rest of the country. I had not realised that he lacked such power in relation to the Greater London plan. The Greater London plan has been presented as an entity and, naturally, there are anxieties when it is suggested that certain parts of it should be operated without other parts. We understand that the Minister will be guided by the recommendations that will follow the inquiry and that he envisages the possibility of those recommendations suggesting that certain parts go forward, while other parts need reconsideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
He hopes that that may be the case, rather than that there should be a reconsideration of the whole set of proposals. I understand his anxiety about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In much of the plan, one part affects another. For example, the major proposals about ring roads, which have been subject to so much criticism, affect the strategic centres and their possible development. Housing policy is clearly related to the argument about the distribution of investment between new development and rehabilitation. One case where that argument has been put forward is in the detailed action plan affecting Covent Garden, where part of the argument of those who objected to the proposals has been that even more attention than is proposed should be given to improvement, repair, and rehabilitation, rather than to wholesale redevelopment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many such examples of the way in which one part of a plan almost inevitably affects another, and one would not like to give 	<i>carte blanche</i> approval to this suggestion without seeing what we are talking about. We may be a good deal clearer by the time the Bill goes to another place, or indeed, reaches the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the purposes of the record, this measure has already been through another place; we are receiving it from there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes; it will go back purely in respect of any Amendments that are made here. If we make any Amendments, those Amendments, in a comparable procedure to our own, will be considered in another place. The Minister is quite right to correct me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are taking powers to enable the boroughs to go ahead with their work and not to be held up by long-term considerations which, in some people's view, might go on interminably. One well understands the desire of the boroughs to get ahead with their work. We are not altogether happy as to the extent to which they will be able to do so in terms of their own delegated powers—if I may use that term. We relate what we are doing here to the other Bill that is still under consideration in the House—the Local Government Bill, and the famous Clause 100, which is now Clause 101. We want to be sure that we have an interpretation of those powers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
which is adequate for the needs of the London boroughs, and we are not altogether happy about that position at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the general objective of the new Schedule and the attempt to clarify and bring together many separate provisions that were available before are broadly welcome. If we should find that further investigation is needed there will always be the opportunity on Report. But if the Minister cares to add anything to the comments that he made in introducing the Schedule—particularly on the interaction of different parts of the Greater London plan—it will be of great value to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that perhaps the major amendment to the Schedule allows the approval of the Greater London Development Plan in parts. As the Secretary of State has power to do it everywhere else in the country we thought—having discovered that this had been done by mistake in earlier legislation—that we should put it right in this Bill, particularly with such a massive exercise as the Greater London plan and the Layfield inquiry on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt whether there will be any occasion on which the Secretary of State will approve, without the recommendation of the Layfield inquiry, any part of the plan. But there may be such an occasion—and I have in mind particularly areas in which the central Government take an active part, either financially or by means of consultants for the area or something of that sort: for example, the docklands. We may be well advanced with plans for that area and the Greater London plan might give us a clear indication of the future there, and we could approve part of the plan in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we progress with the third London Airport the communications at this end may involve early approval of part of the plan. We could think of other transport subjects in the Greater London area, apart from ring roads; for example, the extension of the Fleet line, and the decision whether, in that area, transport should be above or below ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Covent Garden proposals have some financial backing from the Government and at a certain stage it may be right for us to proceed with that and not wait for approval of the whole London
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
plan. Another case that occurs to me is the London borough local plans, which can be prepared before the GLDP is approved as a structure plan, but no publicity is to be given to them until that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One borough may have gone well ahead with its local plans and be ready to make them public and carry on public participation. If that occurs, we should like to be free to approve that borough's part of the Greater London plan. Those are the sorts of occasion on which we would want to maintain flexibility and be ready to accommodate those who are ready to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This will be a very useful power in the hands of the Secretary of State in order to accommodate those who have gone ahead with plans and do not want to be held back by the fact that the whole of the GLDP is not yet a structure plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and negatived.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 5</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>CONTINUANCE IN FORCE OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO CONTROL OF OFFICE DEVELOPMENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. E. Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In asking the Committee not to allow Clause 5 to stand part of the Bill I recognise that I am dealing with something fundamental to the Bill itself. It should be borne in mind that the provisions of this Clause were laid down in the Industrial Development Act, 1965, and at that time they were not regarded as being a permanent part of our legislation. However, we all know that there is nothing more permanent in this life than that which is temporary, and that once something is put on the Statute Book it takes a great deal of effort to get it removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the statement dealing with this subject was published by the Government of the day in 1964 there were obvious reasons why some control of this sort should be placed upon the Statute Book, but I emphasise once more that it was nevertheless regarded only as a temporary measure. For that reason a period of seven years was regarded as adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it were not for the Bill now before us this provision would expire on 5th
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0506">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
August, 1972, and, since it was put on the Statute Book, it should be borne in mind that on 7th December, 1970, as reported in HANSARD, at col. 45, the Minister increased the O.D.P. limit in Greater London from 3,000 sq. ft. to 10,000 sq. ft. These two things taken together—the temporary nature of the Bill plus the relaxation that has already been taken—imply that there is some doubt in the minds of the Government whether this restriction is any longer necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government first introduced a standstill on new offices in London. In doing so they recognised that it would be necessary to examine with the G.L.C. the whole employment situation in London in relation to housing, transport and services, in order to determine the level of office employment acceptable in the long term. Since then the Greater London Development Plan has been placed before the House and the country, and detailed information has been given on the subject. It is felt that sufficient information is now available to the House, and to this Committee in particular, to enable a firm decision to be taken as to the future of office control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are certain factors to consider. First, when this plan was introduced there was undoubtedly a proliferation of office accommodation throughout the whole of the Greater London area, much of which was unused and had remained empty for many years. But that is hardly the position today. Offices are being built and absorbed as quickly as they are put up. I know of no case where approval for office accommodation beyond the figure of 10,000 sq. ft. has been refused, which seems to imply that Government Departments, as such, recognise that there is this demand for accommodation and approve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present there is a great deal of frustration because the applicant has three different authorities to pass through before he can obtain final approval. This is clearly time-wasting and costly. The Government, in the Bill, recognise that about £42,000 is spent annually in administering this provision, and that it involves the employment of appropriate staff. London is one of the greatest cities in the world, if not the greatest city. Its population is probably greater than that of most countries, and its financial
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
resources are certainly far greater than the budgets of many other countries. It will always be the trading capital of the world, and particularly of this country. As the Common Market develops, its position and place in the industrial life of this country will become even more important. No matter which political party controls it for the time being the Greater London Council is an authority with great responsibility, and I submit that it is now fully capable of handling the affairs of this great city, especially the question of office accommodation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Cooper) has made his case very moderately and most persuasively. One point of detail, on which I know he will agree with me, is that office development control does not extend only to London; it is wider than that. But I take his point on London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member very properly said that originally the need for control over office development was proved; he accepted that. He is now saying that there is no longer such a need, for the various reasons that he has given, and he quoted the relaxation made in December, 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee would probably accept that a matter of principle is involved here. The very fact that London and the South-East is such a magnet—the Great Wen, as it has been called—means that the whole question of its resources and supplies comes into consideration. Not only that; above all, the movements of people and the way in which they travel to work need to be considered. These are all vital points in a consideration of the question of how much office development should be allowed in London and the South-East, and what we ought to do about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us feared that in the end we might have a great trading office centre in London and the South-East, with people commuting backwards and forwards for many miles. Already, Sir Stephen, apart from the many people who have for some years commuted from your excellent and healthy part of the world—and I have known many of them—people are now commuting from as far as Peterborough, for example. There is an efficient train service, and a motorway, and that can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea of an expanding office centre, taking up a disproportionate amount of the bricks, cement and other materials,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
together with the labour involved in construction, would not be to the best interests of London, the South-East, and the country as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As time has gone by it is probably right that the need to control office development has lessened. The hon. Gentleman was right to draw our attention to the relaxation that has been made. But it seems to me that the proper way to do this is in the way that the Minister has suggested, which is to retain the provision for a further five years, while we see how London develops, and so that we can deal with all these problems, at the same time leaving relaxation as a question of administration. An O.D.P. is undoubtedly easier to obtain today than it was four or five years ago. I suppose that that reflects the fact that some relaxation is needed, but there is no reason why this should not continue until eventually, if the House so decides, we can abolish office development control. I do not know whether we shall be able to. Other considerations may arise in five years' time. Certainly the considerations at the moment are important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the hon. Gentleman's fears can be met if the administration is tackled with some degree of imagination, and with a knowledge, built up over the past seven years, of the problems involved. For that reason, I hope that the Minister will not go back on the provisions of the Clause. I am sure that he will not. It is a valuable Clause. It enables one to judge the situation clearly, almost from day to day, and come to the right conclusion at any moment. For that reason, I regret to say that I could not support the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Cox</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the comments made by my right hon. Friend. I listened with interest to the arguments of the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Cooper), but I cannot support the points that he has made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speaking as a Member representing an Inner London constituency, the problem that I—and, I am sure, other London Members—have found in recent years, is that we are losing a great deal of local employment because businessmen have come to an area and have purchased properties, after which they have erected office building within the area—when they have been able to obtain permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
In the view of my authority, permission has often been obtained far too easily. As a result, the traditional industries that we have had within our communities—industries which have brought local employment, and have been of financial benefit to the local community—are vanishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Londoners have a great character. I often think that local employment adds much to the life of an area. Instead of that, throughout inner London many local employment opportunities that previously existed are beginning to vanish, thus presenting great problems to local residents. In their place we see the erection of gigantic offices, employing many people who do not live in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of these office workers travel long distances to work. That brings no benefit to the area. The community feeling of the area is beginning to disappear. There is great activity during the day, but after five or six o'clock in the evening the area becomes completely dead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I question the point made by the hon. Member for Ilford, South on the problems arising from the shortage of office space. We are all too familiar with the problems in central London and some of the outer London boroughs. We can travel around and see vast office blocks that have remained empty for months or even years at a time. If there is such a pressing demand for office accommodation, I find it difficult to accept as satisfactory any excuses for the fact that some office blocks remain empty for such long periods. If there were continual pressure, so that as soon as an office block was completed it was occupied by different companies—many of which, I accept, play a valuable and important part in the economic life of the country—I might take a different view. But I do not take that view, because I do not see that taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware of some blocks remaining empty for years at a time. Let us make those office blocks play a vital part in the affairs of the country. If we can do that I shall be prepared to concur in the view that there should be some relaxation. Until then I am not prepared to support the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to answer the points made by the hon. Member for Wandsworth, Central (Mr. Thomas Cox) right away. On the question of office blocks remaining empty, I do not think that he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
will find that within the controlled area of London and the South-East any recently-built blocks remain empty. The general practice in the application of O.D.P. is that we require to know who will occupy the block. The block will be custom-built rather than a matter of speculation. The hon. Member will find that the blocks that have become famous as vacant blocks came into existence before this type of control was established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the inner London suburbs having gigantic office buildings in the centre, with the result that they are deserted outside office working hours, I do not think that we could apply O.D.P. control in considering the life of the suburb in that way. It is undoubtedly a town planning matter which the local planning authority should consider when giving planning permission for the erection of office blocks of this sort. But that kind of consideration, however important, should not enter into the administration of O.D.P.s. It is very important, of course, but it is for the local planning authority to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering whether to delete the Clause. The law at present provides for office development control to lapse on 5th August, 1972, and the Clause has the effect of extending the control by a further five years. There is a five years' limit, with power to reduce that period by order of the Secretary of State. To delete the Clause would bring to an end the operation of the control in August of this year, as provided originally in the Control of Office and Industrial Development Act, 1965, which is now consolidated with the 1971 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.00 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Cooper) said, that Act was intended as a temporary Measure, and the present limit was imposed in 1965 for that reason. We have altered the application of the control. It now applies only to office development schemes of 10,000 sq. ft. and upwards in the South-East economic planning region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said in the Second Reading debate, when I gave the reasons why the Government had decided to extend the life of the existing control, the prime intention is to use the control to help in the implementation of the strategic plan for the South-East, the principles of which have been accepted by the Government,
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
and to implement it to ensure that office growth takes place mainly in the growth areas specified in that plan. Therefore, we are not considering London alone—although my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South and the hon. Member for Wandsworth, Central (Mr. Thomas Cox) addressed their remarks mainly to London. This is a matter for the whole of the South-East. It is hoped that the aim of concentrating development in growth areas will be achieved eventually through the mechanism of the structure plans and the local plans, about which we spoke on earlier Clauses. This is still some way in the future, as our debates have showed. In the meantime, the more direct control involved in the O.D.P. system will be utilised to inhibit office growth in what the Government consider are unsuitable places, and to channel it into areas which the strategic plan for the South-East indicates are in need of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the major source of mobile office employment is London, such a policy necessarily means the retention of restrictions in the capital. I go along with my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South in all that he has said about the present importance of the capital and its future increasing importance in connection with the Common Market. I assure him that we will administer the O.D.P. controls with close regard to that consideration. The last thing that we want to do, particularly in the City, is to obstruct developments which will have to be carried out as a result of our entry to the Common Market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, it would be impossible at this stage to remove control altogether. We can use it in a positive rather than a negative way, particularly in considering whether applications for permits are in accordance with the general trend of Government policy, and whether they are developments for tenants who need to be within the area of London and the South-East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government policy on office location was expressed succinctly in the White Paper on Industrial and Regional Development, published in March, in which the following statement appeared under the heading of "Office Development Permits":
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no case for removing this control in view of the planning pressures in the South-East. But in the administration of the control special account will be taken of the importance
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
of enhancing the prospects of London as an international financial and commercial centre."</p></blockquote>
I ask my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South to appreciate that in the administration of this provision we are agreeing with all that he said about the importance of London. We believe that we can use O.D.P.s positively to meet future demand and channel it into the right areas of London and the South-East, and be necessarily selective in respect of the type of office work for which we give permits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Clause were removed altogether a consequential technical provision, which is included in order to ensure certain unused planning permissions for office development, would go by the board; we would lose the valuable provision made in the Clause that permissions for office development granted before 5th August, 1965, do not lapse in 1974 under the general time limits for implementing planning permission contained in the 1971 Act. That is an advantage which I am sure my hon. Friend would not want to lose by removing the Clause altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the assurance that the system will be administered as a transition stage towards eventually moving this control entirely into town and country planning. I have always wanted to do that. It is no secret that I studied the possibility at this stage to see whether we were ready to move it there and dismantle the O.D.P. system. We shall not be ready until the structure plans and local plans for the South-East are far more advanced. When we reach that stage we can consider leaving the matter entirely to local planning authorities and planning law, but until then we must retain our existing control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members on this side of the Committee support what the Government and the Minister have done in this matter. This should be regarded as a question of London and the South-East against the other regions. The policy of the Labour Government is being continued by the present Government, by inserting this Clause for two reasons. One is to help the regions, but the other is to save London and the South-East from itself. That was the other idea behind the original controls that were brought in in respect of office development in the South-East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ilford, South
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
(Mr. Cooper) has the merit of consistency in his argument. I remember that when these controls were brought before the House in 1965 the then Bill was bitterly opposed by many hon. Members opposite. The hon. Member is at least continuing that policy. Now that the Government are in office they have the wisdom to see why this provision was brought in and to continue its existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with the hon. Member for Ilford, South on his central theme that this provision was necessary when it was brought in but is no longer necessary in 1972. I should say that the facts, both with regard to land and employment, make this provision and the Clause far more necessary now than it was when originally introduced by the Labour Government in 1965.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking land as an example—only last week we had a debate on the price of land and the tremendous inflation on all types of land. That debate was directed particularly to housing, but the same is true of land for other purposes. The situation is far more acute today than in 1965. As the Minister pointed out, offices are not often left empty now, because strict control is exercised to see that there is a user, in order to prevent speculative building. The Minister would probably agree that it is precisely because of this control that we no longer have Centre Points and large blocks of office accommodation deliberately left empty for capital appreciation, even though there is a demand for offices and office accommodation within the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point with regard to land in the South-East in general and London in particular is that if the Clause disappeared and there was virtually unrestricted office development in the area we should have a thriving community by day and a desert by night. That is the sort of planning that the House of Commons and local authorities seek to avoid. A go-to-work area to which people travel for many miles, is not a community. A few people are left in the City, or in the area where these huge office blocks are erected, and many of them are unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Precisely because the land is taken up by these huge offices—to which commuters come for work—no land is available for the light industry, for unskilled or semi-skilled workers, that is sorely needed within the London area. London con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
stituencies are in the same position as areas in the North-West or North-East, but for only a section of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point is that with high-priced land, as in the London area, the type of office development that takes place is inevitably of the skyscraper variety. It has to go higher and higher to make the land economic. From a planning point of view many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee view with alarm what was allowed to happen to the skyline of the City of London—our capital city—particularly in the late fifties and the early sixties—as a result of some disastrous architectural developments. Those developments took place because of economic pressure. Land was very dear, and therefore people had to build upwards, regardless of the skyline and the history of London, and of the fact that this was our capital city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployment is far more acute today than it was in 1965 and 1966. The unemployment figures alone, not only for this region, but for the whole country, show that. Office development in London would not help to provide employment for the people in London in need of employment. But office development outside the South-East is sorely needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wandsworth, Central (Mr. Thomas Cox) desperately needs employment for a section of the community, but he cannot get it, because there is no land available to build factories. My hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West (Mr. Armstrong) and I, however, find need for employment across the board. Many girls leave school or technical college after secretarial or typing training and find their only choice is coming to London to find a job, because jobs matching the skill they have acquired are not available locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In London the position is reversed. When one travels on the Tube, one sees that so many jobs are available, that if a girl has a disagreement with her "boss", so the advertisements tell her, it is not her fault, but her boss's fault, and she should change her boss, because there is something wrong with him. That might be right and I should like that happy situation, where there is so much full employment, to develop throughout the whole country. But I see no signs of it. But when that is at the expense of a girl in Newcastle, Liverpool, or Glasgow, who is fully trained
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
and yet cannot get a job in her home town, the Government should step in to make sure that that type of job is spread around the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause is still temporary and is to last only until 1977. Both the Minister and the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Cooper) mentioned our possibly forthcoming entry into the Common Market and its importance for London and the South-East. Many Opposition Members and some Government supporters are anxious—and this is one of our criticisms of entry into the Common Market—about the danger that it will draw this sort of employment away from the regions to the South-East even more than today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are wise to say that the provision should last only until 1977, because another effect of the Common Market is that the South-East may suffer precisely the difficulties we now have in the North-East and North-West. That type of employment may drift away from London and the South-East and cross the Channel to Brussels and to the centre lands of the Common Market. Therefore, it may be necessary in 1977 to have another look at the situation to study the position of office development in London. Some of us fear that at that time not only will the regions be derelict, but even London and the South-East may be applying to the House for the status of a distressed area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to explain to the Committee that my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Marks)—who has just arrived—in whose name Amendment No. 10 stands, is serving on two Committees, as many of us have to do, and has returned to this Committee to speak on his Amendment. I am sure that he and the Committee will forgive me if I do not deal with the inclusion of trees from demolition in preservation areas, for my hon. Friend will deal with that more than adequately without any help from me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will concentrate on Amendment No. 31, standing in my name and dealing with archaeological sites and sites of historical interest. I am not talking about existing sites; I am talking of sites within the context of the Bill where, for the sake of preserving archaeological evidence, or, sometimes the whole of the site, it may be necessary for the local planning authorities, sometimes under emergency procedure, to put a restriction on demolition either permanently, or for a temporary period, until the necessary investigations and archaeological recordings have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a tremendous amount of urban development in the country. Time after time, one reads in the Press that in the course of that development, sometimes entirely unknown to the developers until they come across them, the foundations of a site have been found, a site of great archaeological importance. It has occurred in London recently—it always makes the news—and in other cities, too. In such a situation, the contractor, if he has any sense of history and of civic responsibility, agrees, sometimes at considerable expense to himself and to the development of his project, that university archaeologists may come and look at the site and at least
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
make a hurried work of recording what was on the site, because it will be obliterated for ever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Amendments suggest that where there is such an archaeological site, a local authority may, under the emergency procedure provided in the Bill, put a notice on the land at least to hold up the development for a time, until there can be an investigation of the site and a recording of the findings before the site is destroyed—historically and archaeologically—for ever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the situation arises, as it could, where the site is unique, or of such enormous importance that it certainly should be preserved, the local authority could put an order on the site in the same way that it may put an order on a row of Georgian houses. The two seem to be parallel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is historically and archaeologically important to preserve a well-planned row of Georgian houses from the hammers of the demolition contractors, so that that piece of history and beauty shall not be destroyed for ever, it is equally important when a site is suddenly discovered, or known about but never excavated, a site which is just as much the history of the country but far more ancient, perhaps not of architectural beauty, but of great archaeological interest, that there should be some statutory provision to allow the local planning authority to hold up the development at that point and, if necessary, go to the Secretary of State and obtain an order confirming it, to hold up the demolition and destruction of the site until some investigation has taken place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I am sure that he will bear in mind that we are dealing with the control of demolition in conservation areas. He seems to be making the general case rather than the particular.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, that is a very good point to which I was coming, Sir Stephen. I have limited my Amendment to the Bill as it stands, in order to put my toe in the water and see how the Government react to it. If the Amendment were to be accepted in principle—and I have no reason, from the sort of replies that the Minister gave in the House to my hon. Friend the Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) last Monday, to think that the Government are looking sympathetically at this provision—the Government might
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
in this Bill, which is very much a miscellaneous provisions Bill, themselves introduce a new Clause on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the Clause is limited to conservation areas, but let us at least have this provision within conservation areas now, where these sites are more likely to be found than in non-conservation areas. I should like it to be a general power over the country as a whole, but I am certain that the Bill could be the vehicle for such a new Clause if the Government accepted the spirit of the Amendments, although I appreciate that their wording may be far from falicitous. Something needs to be done urgently, as the newspaper reports show.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a tremendous heritage throughout the country. Conservation areas and non-conservation areas provide a wealth of history and knowledge, much of it unknown and unexplored, which is often, with motorways and urban developments, on the point of being destroyed for ever. Let us at least give some statutory power to hold up the process while those invaluable facts are recorded for future generations of students.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Marks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I suggested the Amendments on trees, one of my hon. Friends suggested that I displayed an almost canine interest in trees. I should explain that in the part of my constituency where I was born lamp-posts were rather more frequent than trees, and we had many more bricks than leaves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that area, when we built a park or a school in those days, we surrounded it with trees. At that time, I understand, they were called "Manchester poplars" because they stood up to the industrial grime of the city. When I was doing some research on tree preservation not long ago, I discovered that they had another name, "Downy Blacks"; I cannot think of any more appropriate name for that tree, because it grows quickly and stands up to industrial life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What helps to create a conservation area is not only that there are some buildings that ought to be preserved. One thinks of a conservation area as having character, and trees bring a great deal to that character, often more than the buildings. One of the difficulties of tree preservation is the complication of a tree preservation order. If we are to retain these oases—and in my area they are oases—we must preserve not only the buildings and
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
the archaeological possibilities, but all the natural amenities, including the trees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This week I had a letter from the city planning officer of Manchester about these difficulties. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the present tree preservation procedure … is cumbersome administratively with the need for referencing, serving of notices … Only today (27th April) I received information that certain trees within the Victoria Park Conservation Area were likely to be felled and I have had to report immediately to the Planning Committee on the need for a Tree Preservation Order to retain them. The amendment which you suggest to clause 7 of the Bill would remove the need for the T.P.O. procedure."</p></blockquote>
He gives me the surprising figure of only five confirmed tree preservation orders within this city of 600,000 people.
	<br><blockquote><p>"… these have been prepared as a result of development and other pressures which threatened the trees. I would like to prepare Tree Preservation Orders covering many areas of the City but the staff time involved precludes me from doing this.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The City Council have designated eight Conservation Areas within the City, five of which are within the Central Area the remaining three being in the southern part … There are a considerable number of trees within these Conservation Areas outside the City Centre and the areas would of course benefit from your suggested amendments."</p></blockquote>
This is probably typical of the conservation areas in the cities where tree life is of tremendous importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a short time I lived in a part of Manchester that had once been a residential enclave with gates at the entrances. When the estate was originally built, all kinds of trees had been planted, not just Manchester poplars or Downy Blacks, but horse chestnuts and oaks and all the rest. In many ways, the trees were a nuisance, but it was a splendid place to live and it had tremendous atmosphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not have enough trees. I hope that we will do all in our power to preserve those that we have. The present tree preservation orders are not entirely satisfactory, and the Bill gives us an opportunity at least to help to save some in the conservation areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sydney Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Marks) should not apologise for his interest in trees. I too, have an interest and I have been variously described as "The Trees Man", "The Man of the Trees" and, by one or two of my colleagues when I go into the Tea Room, as "The Doggies'
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
Delight"; I almost dare not go into the Smoking Room in case there is an equally rude description.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sympathetic to Amendment No. 10. I see the problem in much the same terms as the hon. Member for Gorton. We have too few trees in the very areas of the country where we most need them—in our towns and cities. Most of the 1,742 conservation areas which have been designated so far are in our towns and cities. If we could strengthen legislation to deal with trees in conservation areas, we should be making a great stride towards solving the problem. There is the negative side of stopping people from cutting down or mutilating trees, and there is the positive side, which I am delighted to see that the Government have accepted, with the proposal that next year should be National Tree Planting Year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that we are looking after one and not the other. It is rather like pouring hot water into the bath, in the sense of having a national tree planting year, but finding that somebody is pulling out the plug at the other end, in the sense that legislation to deal with the preservation of tree orders is not being sufficiently strengthened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will doubtless argue that we already have the legislative machinery to deal with this problem. Any local planning authority has the opportunity of putting a tree preservation order on a tree if it considers that tree to be of amenity value. As the hon. Member for Gorton so rightly says, few local planning authorities, with all their pressing problems, have the men, the resources, or the time to make adequate surveys of trees in their area, particularly in the conservation areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tree preservation orders have now been in existence for 10 years. They were first introduced in the Town and Country Act, 1962, and the legislation was strengthened in the Civic Amenities Act, 1967 and the Town and Country Planning Act, 1968, and they were all consolidated in the 1971 Act. The hon. Member for Gorton mentioned that there were only five tree preservation orders in Manchester, that Mecca of municipal magnificence. That is one more than at the beginning of the year, and three more than at the beginning of last year. Manchester is at least making progress, unlike Leeds, where for the last two years there have not been more than
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
10 preservation orders on trees or groups of trees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can therefore make the point that, however effective the legislation is in theory, it is not doing its job in practice. We ought at some time to consider Sections 59 to 62 of the 1971 Act which concern tree preservation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulties of the Amendments are administrative problems. They are in line with the administrative problems that I met when I sought to strengthen the legislation on tree preservation in my Private Member's Bill last Session.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Minister might ask, "What is a tree?" That is a fair question. I should not think it beyond the resources of his Department to define a tree, leaving out immature shrubs and so on. I am sure that we could find a definition, for example, of the difference between a bush and a tree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, and this is what recommends the Amendment to me; even though local planning authorities put preservation orders on certain trees, it is difficult for members of the public to know which trees have preservation orders on them. I am putting it at its most charitable, but many trees with preservation orders come down, and people say quite glibly, "We did not know that there was a preservation order".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the strong points for the Amendment is that everybody would know that every tree in a conservation area would be the subject, in effect, of a tree preservation order. One would have to get permission for it to be "demolished", if that is the right phrase as we are linking trees with buildings in this context. The local planning authority would have to put a direction that that tree should be subject to permission before demolition. This may be another difficulty about the Amendment as it stands, because, presumably, all the legislation which applies to buildings would also have to be applied to trees, and if the Amendment were carried there might be some difficulties of definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another respect in which the Amendment does not meet the needs of the situation. In urban areas—and I come back to the terms of the Amendment by saying that conservation areas generally are in urban areas—most of the trees are owned by the local authority, which is generally the local planning authority
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
itself. I should like to see a provision that they must obtain permission if they want to chop down their own trees. I do not think that the Amendment would meet that sort of situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know the instance of a road being widened and the trees lining the road invariably belonging to the local council. We also know what happens when the No. 10 bus is impeded in its progress down the street. If there is one thing worse than chopping down a tree, it is mutilating it in the sense of topping it instead of lopping it. I do not think that the Amendment would overcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My own view is that there should be a more radical solution to this problem, that one should not just have to get permission to chop down any tree in the country, exclusive of trees in Forestry Commission areas—and one would make natural exceptions in the countryside. My own solution is that anyone who wants to chop down a tree, particularly in a conservation area, ought to give at least six weeks' notice of intention, to give the local planning authority the opportunity to look at that tree and see whether a T.P.O. ought to be put on it because of amenity value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall listen with great interest to what my hon. Friend has to say about this, because I think that, whatever the deficiencies of the Amendment, the sentiments behind it are admirable and worthwhile.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hands-worth (Mr. Sydney Chapman), I think that Amendment No. 10 expresses a principle that ought to command a great deal of support, not only in the Committee, but in the House as a whole. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman quite made his point on definition. As far as I could understand it, he was making the point that, while God alone could make a tree, the Minister alone could define it. The Minister has defined it before. There is such a thing as a tree preservation order and if it was not properly defined, then even in Leeds they are busy preserving 10 individual or groups of objects that are not trees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local planning authorities make relatively few preservation orders, but they make them on trees. The trees are known as trees to everybody, but when I tried to introduce my Private Member's Bill last Sesesion, to provide
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
that any tree should be the subject of a notice of intention before it was cut down, many hon. Members from both sides of the House immediately jumped on me and asked, "What is a tree?" meaning, "Is that sapling that I planted in my garden last year a tree yet, or is it still a sapling?" That is the problem that one would face if one had a blanket protection on all trees in conservation areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the criticism is better directed to the word "any" than to the word "tree".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as the essence of the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Marks) is concerned; I see that it might be an advantage if the wording were such that it included local authorities, too. I think that there is a great deal of point in that, and I have no doubt that my hon. Friend would take the same point of view. As we agreed, this is a question of what the best principle may be. In a conservation area, to conserve the listed buildings, but allow somebody, through default even, to chop down the trees or to damage them, would be a grotesque omission on the part of the planning authority, and perhaps on our part as guardians of the planning law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The saddest sight that it is possible to see is as one looks down the Unter den Linded in Berlin, where all the trees were chopped as a result of the fighting that took place in the last war, and these rows of arborial corpses strike the eye. They are grotesque and ugly. A great deal of this sort of thing takes place here, too, and that was one of the points the hon. Gentleman was making, although perhaps not for the same reason as in Berlin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ought to consider what we are to do about this. I have no doubt that the Minister will. It seems to me that the argument that the tree preservation order by itself is not really effective has great merit. It is a positive action that a local planning authority has to take, whereas if one deals with the prohibition of the demolition of trees in a conservation area, that automatically protects the trees. It is then up to those who wish to destroy the trees to justify their action. It puts the onus the other way round, and this is what my hon. Friend was getting at and what the hon. Member for Handsworth would support if it were more general and more easily defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will give us
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
some words of comfort on this matter. I certainly would not advise my hon. Friends, although others of them will want to catch your eye, Sir Stephen, that the Amendment should be pressed to a Division, although it probably needs some quiet thought between now and Report. Perhaps the Minister, too, needs to think about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has seen over the years how bad archaeology, or simple lack of appreciation of what the historic past really means, has caused incredible devastation within the memory of man. It was said in Rome that at the time when the Barberinis were pulling down Roman monuments in order to build their palaces, the inhabitants of Rome, looking at the devastation said "	<i>non Barbari sed Barbarini".</i> That was one way of causing the destruction of items of historic, archaeological and aesthetic attraction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other way is when one inadvertently digs up the past. As we develop all over the country, as we dig roads in particular, as we put up new buildings, as we dig deeper, as we must with our great new modern buildings, so we disturb the history of our country as it lies underneath the ground. In disturbing it we make it evident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most attractive attitudes to this sort of situation that I know is that adopted by the new town of Peterborough, which has found that there was a kind of Black Country under the Romans, a brickmaking area in what is the new town. It has been developed as a kind of walk, as an open space where people may see the Roman ovens and the Roman monuments and remains. All that has been built into the character of the town. That is highly commendable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the amount of money required to build roads in particular, it is understandable that developers, and the Government, are a little loth to halt the building of what are regarded as essential means of communication. The past, too, is essential. I do not quite know why my hon. Friend kept his Amendment to conservation areas: possibly because he thought that this was a good place to insert it. He has certainly rivetted our minds on conservation, whether it be of areas and listed buildings, of trees, or of our past history. I am grateful to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that we have reached a stage when we must do everything we can to protect that tradition and to protect that history. If that causes a road to have to be diverted, if it causes a certain amount of economic loss in order to protect what is worth protecting—there are items we may find that are 2,000 years old which are frankly not worth protecting—we ought to have the machinery with which to do it. I should like my hon. Friend to consider how this might be the better presented On Report. I pass no criticism on his present method because, as he rightly said, he wanted to put his toe in the water. I hope that the water will prove lukewarm, if not a little warmer even than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are rightly concerning ourselves with endeavouring to stop people from demolishing buildings in conservation areas wherever we can. Let us also see that our past is not demolished at the same time as so many other things are being demolished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the Amendments concerning trees and say that I have sat here restraining myself from whistling the tune which must have been in all our heads—"I think that I shall never see". I recollect that many years ago, on one of the big stores in Bournemouth, there was a singing chef who used to come out into the restaurant and sing "Trees", much to the delight of the audience. He always sang "Trees", never any other tune. But the line for which we always waited with baited breath was "A nest of robbings in 'er 'air". We all waited for that and cheered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I resist an Amendment about trees, it is not because my Department does not consider that trees are of the utmost importance in the environment and that we should do all we can to preserve, renew and increase our trees. We have shown by announcing the institution of a National Tree Preservation Year next year that we have this end very much at heart. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Sydney Chapman) was not quite justified in saying that we were running the bathwater with the plug out. We believe that the existing law for the preservation of trees is adequate and fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intended effect of the Amendments is to apply to the felling of trees in conservation areas the same controls which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
apply under Clause 7 to the demolition of buildings. In the interest of preserving the character or appearance of a conservation area, an authority could direct that certain trees should be subject to these controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the preservation of the trees in a conservation area as part of the character of that area, is often as important as the preservation of some of the buildings. But what is proposed would duplicate the existing comprehensive system of control over trees under the tree preservation order system in the planning legislation. I have previously heard my hon. Friend the Member for Handsworth proclaim that the local authorities and the local planning authorities do not apply the tree preservation order system sufficiently and that there are only a few tree preservation orders throughout the whole country. I am not sure that, even if one put it in the negative rather than the positive form, one would get any better results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present procedure is that local planning authorities have power to make tree preesrvation orders in the interest of amenity under Section 29 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1962, which is now Section 60 of the 1971 Act. Such orders prohibit felling, topping, lopping and wilful destruction of the trees without the consent of the local planning authority. An order under that Section requires the Secretary of State's confirmation if any objections are lodged, but—and this is the important point—it may be brought into force in advance of any confirmation by the Secretary of State. This was initiated by Section 16 of the Civic Amenities Act, 1967, which is now embodied in Section 61 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1971.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sections 59, 61 and 62 of the 1971 Act are a sort of "Tree Charter", and adequate provision is made there for the protection of trees. Section 59 places a duty to ensure preservation; Section 61 provides that the orders may be brought into effect immediately if a local planning authority thinks it necessary; Section 62 provides for the replacement of trees. Any decision by the local planning authority under these procedures, for example, refusal to consent to the felling of a tree, may be the subject of appeal to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whereas under the present tree preservation order procedure in the planning
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
legislation the order itself may be objected to, under the Bill that objection procedure does not exist. The existing tree preservation order procedure is fairer and perfectly adequate if the local planning authority, or the local authority, chooses to use it effectively. It would be wrong to encroach on the "Tree Charter" in the 1971 Town and Country Planning Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 31 and 32 are designed to give local planning authorities power to control the site ofs historic and archaeological interest in conservation areas, and I take the point made by the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) that it is not a matter of principle with him that the Amendment applies only to conservation areas and that he is putting it as a test case. Governments over the past years have a good record in the preservation of sites of historic and archaelogical interest. On certain occasions, pressure of development and the costs involved in holding up development have seemed to threaten valuable archaelogical sites, but, on the whole, present legislation has enabled Governments to step in and protect the national interest. In road building every precaution is taken to avoid the destruction of sites of historic and archaeological interest. There is the almost proverbial example of the motorway which is actually built over a historic site, where a tunnel has been built to preserve that site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a site is deemed worthy of preservation in the national interest, it is protected by the provisions of the Ancient Monuments Acts of 1913, 1931 and 1953. The Amendments are unnecessary, because the existing law gives sufficient protection, and this is not the Bill in which to deal with minor Amendments to the existing law. The law is set out in what I will call the "Ancient Monuments Charter"—the three Acts that I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am entirely sympathetic with the wish of the hon. Member for Widnes to preserve sites of our historic past, but few planning authorities have, or can be expected to have, the specialised expertise and advice required to enable them to judge which monuments or achaelogical sites should be preserved in the national interest. None the less, in their use of other powers under the planning Acts, they can do much to protect achaeological sites, whether they are scheduled as such, or whether they are discovered in the course of workings
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
or development of building or roads. They can deal with them under the planning laws, perhaps not so efficiently when the site is discovered in the course of workings, but they can then apply to the Secretary of State for use of the powers under the Ancient Monuments Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The planning law comes into good effect in the case of a well-known archaelogical site, but that is not the case that the hon. Member for Widnes has in mind. It also applies when sites are discovered without previous knowledge before the development started, since application may be made to the Secretary of State to use the powers under the Ancient Monuments Acts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point in bringing it into a planning Bill is that local planning authorities or local authorities have few or no powers under the Ancient Monuments Acts. If a site is discovered, the local authority, being local, has the advantage of knowing about developments in its area which the Secretary of State may not know about. In a site which is discovered, I want a local authority to be able to apply the provisions of Clause 7(4), for example, and make an order with a declaration that it is expedient to have immediate effect. The problem with the Ancient Monuments Acts is that the site may be demolished before the Acts can be brought into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not so. The local authority may draw the attention of the Secretary of State to it immediately. Governments have not failed in the past to take action quickly when attention is drawn to the disclosure of an historic or archaeological site. One has to bear in mind that Governments have had this sort of co-operation in the protection of sites because the Department concerned has the expertise to distinguish between a site of major national interest and a site of no important value of that sort. Because in general the Department has been able to take public opinion with it in deciding what sites are of national interest it has been successful in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised by the Ancient Monuments Board for England—that is the body that advises the Secretary of State—that the basic structure of the Ancient
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
Monuments Acts has stood the test of time and does not need any drastic recasting. As I said in answer to a Parliamentary Question the other day, it is the Government's intention in due course to introduce a Bill containing some desirable Amendments to some of the detailed provisions of the Ancient Monuments Acts, but not to alter the basic procedure under those Acts, or to bring Amendments piecemeal into Town and Country Planning legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps a good example of co-operation between Government and local authority was the case of Baynard's Castle only recently. My Department made available funds jointly with the City of London to excavate the site of part of that castle. In the course of excavation, certain remains came to light, and the City of London is now considering whether it will be possible to preserve any of the ruins then exposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was a case where central and local government acted quickly to preserve something plainly of national importance. The Ancient Monuments Acts allow the quick issue of compulsory preservation orders, and we do not want to duplicate that. It is a precedure which has borne the test of time and may be brought into operation quickly. It has behind it a great deal of expertise in the Department, which it would be difficult for local planning authorities to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we put it into the hands of local authorities throughout the country, in certain places it might be brought into some disrepute. I would rather rely on the advice we receive from that great body of advisers to the Secretary of State, the Ancient Monuments Board for England, and, if necessary, to tidy up the existing procedure rather than move it out of the hands of the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been involved in this issue. I was glad that the Minister referred to the provisions originally enacted in the Civil Amenities Act, of which I was co-sponsor. The right hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Sandys) rightly devoted a great deal of attention both to establishing the whole concept of conservation areas and tree preservation, and increasing the number of trees, not only in conservation areas, but much more widely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the issues with which we tried to deal was the danger of action being taken and trees being completely cut down
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
or severely damaged before anything could be done by the local authority. We hoped by the Measure, drafted with the co-operation of the Government of the day, to overcome some of the main difficulties. In spite of that provision, now consolidated in the Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, there are many examples of local authorities feeling unable to operate the Measure. The problem still seems largely to remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said, for example, that local authorities find that the procedure requires much work and attention by staff which it is difficult for them to provide. That suggests to me that we need to look at it further to see whether there is any way of improving the procedure already laid down. The number of preservation orders made does not encourage one to think that enough is being done in large parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned not only with some of our great historic towns and cities, but with many industrial and older areas where trees can be of such great importance. That factor was very much in mind when the Civic Amenities Act was passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment would still require the local planning authority to take the positive action of passing a resolution. I cannot see what improvement it makes to the existing position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsiop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I wonder whether some discussions could take place—they need not be long drawn out—with the local authorities to follow up the points made both by my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hands-worth (Mr. Sydney Chapman) to see whether the authorities have any suggestions about how the procedure could be improved. I am sure that my hon. Friend, like myself, would be open-minded about it. We are not sticking to the precise wording of the Amendment, but we should like the assurance that there will be some discussion on the point and the opportunity of the Bill taken to give greater force and reality to this provision. There is a great and growing public interest in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in what the Minister said about the possibility of motorways being constructed over archaeological sites. I am in correspondence with his Department over a case at this moment. It concerns a site near a famous Roman
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
camp up in Corstopitum at Corbridge in Northumberland. If we go back far enough, it was the capital of the great Kingdom of Northumbria, a very important area, as my hon. and right hon. Friends will concede. There, tragically enough, a Roman bathhouse just outside the area of the Roman camp itself, which had not been fully excavated but had been known, was partly destroyed by the landowner in a fit of pique because he thought, quite wrongly as it turned out, that a major road diversion was to come near some properties on his estate, which he did not want to happen, instead of going across the area of the Roman bathhouse. In order to decide the matter, as he thought, he bulldozed part of the Roman bathhouse. The damage was not a complete disaster, but it was a partial disaster. The stupidity is that, as has been made clear by many experts, provided certain sealing off could take place, the roadway could well have gone over the top of the Roman bathhouse, and the owner of the land and the houses and everybody else could have been happy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this occurrence will have some happy issue, but, unfortunately, this was not a listed building. It was mistakenly thought that agreements had been reached with the landowner, that a happy gentlemen's agreement had been reached. This is the kind of issue that might have been covered more adequately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister might clear this up, but I should have thought it could never be a listed building because it is an ancient monument. Listed buildings can be historic buildings only within the control of the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have got the terminology slightly wrong, but it could have been recorded, which it was not and which it should have been. I merely referred to it because the Minister specifically referred to motorway construction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an exciting development that there is a growing public interest in this whole area which at one time concerned only a few people. Now it attracts many more people and has great educational value. Therefore I strongly support the intentions of the Amendments, and I hope that the Minister will look again at whether the existing legislation is adequate for the kind of problems that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
We realise that the Amendments cover a great deal of the same area and we do not want to add to confusion—we want clarity, not confusion. But we should welcome further examination of the problem by the Minister before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Allason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what my hon. Friend has said about the quick issue of preservation orders under the Ancient Monuments Act. I have had an experience of this in my constituency, when the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) was the Minister responsible. A bulldozer working in a school playground on the site of the old Royal palace at King's Langley unearthed some masonry which turned out to be the wine cellar of Edward II. The same day I was consulted and I consulted the Minister, and the next day an expert went to have a look at the site, and the following day a preservation order was issued. There was a delay of two days. A determined developer might have said, "Let us get rid of this thing quickly, because it will hold up the whole work on the site". Happily, that did not happen in this instance, but it can. There is an argument for some sort of intermediate order so that, as soon as what is suspected to be an important site is uncovered, it may immediately be preserved pending the arrival of the experts and the Minister's order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) has described the case of the indignant landowner who wanted to ensure that a motorway went the way he thought it should go. I do not know whether there is some alternative possibility, perhaps making it some sort of offence to destroy an archaeological site even though not listed, but an "accepted building" or an "accepted site". There might be some remedy in that direction. I should have thought that there was a case, which might well be dissussed with the local authorities' associations, for trying to patch over this brief period between the time when the site is discovered and the fairly rapid issue of the preservation order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the expert comments of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Mr. Sidney Chapman). The title "Man of the Trees" is no title
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
to be ashamed of: he should be proud of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He said that he took the most charitable view when he was talking about people who felled trees. He can say that again! Though we criticise and rightly condemn vandals who destroy telephone kiosks and break windows, we ought to reserve a great deal of our condemnation for those who vandalise our natural amenities solely for profit. Even though the penalty for the illegal felling of trees is now increased to £250, this is as nothing compared with the profit that may be made from a site cleared of trees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped for a more encouraging reply from the Minister. He accepted that trees were of the utmost importance, especially in conservation areas, but he regarded the existing law as adequate and fair. I doubt whether a number of people in preservation and planning would agree with him about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He says that the Amendment would duplicate legislation, but that is precisely what the Clause does. It duplicates the legislation about listed buildings. There is already legislation for looking at them, but this provision is giving blanket legislation for better and more urgent protection. We should do something more about trees. We have not had a great deal of pressure from local authorities and other interested bodies because at the moment they are so involved in and, perhaps, confused about local government reorganisation that they have not much time to devote to other aspects of the work of Parliament which closely affect them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we could get another discussion about this subject on Report, we will probably find that in the meantime local authorities and other interested bodies will have had something more to say. In any event, I hope that between now and Report the Minister will consult local authorities further about whether anything can be done in the Bill for the more urgent preservation of trees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting discussion about trees and archaeological sites. The Minister's main argument is that there is provision in the existing law. Both my hon. Friend and some hon. Gentlemen opposite have certain qualms about whether the existing law is entirely adequate: hence the great speculation and qualms when an archaelogical site is about to be developed when agreements
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
have to be reached quickly with the developer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Minister has replied in great detail to our arguments. I hope that we have given him something to think about by alleging gaps in the law. He has certainly given us something to think about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just before the hon. Gentleman does anything irretrievable, perhaps he will allow me to answer one or two observations, particularly about historic and archaeological sites.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not mention—this arose in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Allason)—that there are approximately 10,000 scheduled sites which are fully protected and if that in Northumberland had been so scheduled, there would have been trouble about the landowner ploughing it up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process of scheduling is going on all the time, not quite as quickly as the listing of historic buildings. A team is doing this work all the time, and new sites are being added. I do not think that we could hasten that work, but this is an administrative matter rather than a need for an alteration in legislation. We shall continue to schedule as many as the expert knowledge on this subject allows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to temporary protection; the case which my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead disclosed to the Committee shows that the Department acts quickly and it also shows how efficient the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) was when he was a Minister, because it was during his period of office. It shows how efficient my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead was in notifying the Department of this discovery. Altogether, it clearly worked quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I wonder whether it would have worked so quickly if he had had to go to the town clerk who would have gone to the planning officer who would have called the sub-committee on planning to decide what to do, and it would then have had to go before the full council. We are dealing with things more efficiently under the present system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister and I would agree that not only do we want to preserve trees, but we especially want to preserve oaks! My hon. Friend's Amendment, which was a toe-in-water Amendment, is hot designed as an alternative to the exist-
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
ing machinery which, under some Ministers, is very good, but as an additional belt to the braces which already hold up the archaeological trousers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hesitation stems from the fact that because it is done by experts now, to put even temporary orders in the hands of people who are not experts might bring the whole system into disrepute. I should like to look at it from that point of view, because that is what worries me about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give an undertaking that we could introduce anything of this sort in the Bill, but I give an assurance that we have on the stocks a Bill to amend the Ancient Monuments Acts, and what has been said today will be taken in full consideration in preparing that Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment has been mainly argued on the basis that it would automatically protect trees in a conservation area. Of course, that is not so, and I should strongly oppose anything of that kind. I should want any local planning authority or local authority to take positive action and positively to consider whether trees should be protected, in the same way as it has to consider positively whether it should protect any buildings in a conservation area although they are not listed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From that point of view, I shall look at the two provisions again—Clause 7 as against the tree charter in the 1971 Act—but certainly not on the basis of any automatic protection. We must make the local planning authority think carefully before it takes this sort of action, as we do in making authorities think carefully about applying the conservation provisions to non-listed buildings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for the great care that he has shown in his reply to the Amendment, about both trees and archaeological sites. In view of his last statement, this may be an occasion when both sides of the Committee would like to discuss the matter in the House on Report in the light of further investigations. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 11, in page 8, line 26, leave out from "buildings" to end of line 31.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment seeks to leave out paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of Clause 7(1). It may help
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0521">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
the Committee if I give a resumé of what Section 58(2) of the 1971 Town and Country Planning Act said, because the paragraph refers to it. Three types of building are mentioned. The first category is ecclesiastical buildings in use—and I should make the point that a building that is used mainly as a residence of the vicar is not defined as an ecclesiastical building; it is generally churches in use and not disused churches. The second category is a building subject of an ancient monument's scheme or order. The third category is a building included in a list of monuments published by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see why it is necessary to exclude these three categories of buildings or monuments. In approximately 1,750 conservation areas already designated, the buildings are centred around a church and to remove the church would make a nonsense of the conservation area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amateurish researches have disclosed that the reason that churches are excluded as buildings that may be listed as buildings of architectural and historic interest is that under the Ancient Monuments Act, 1913, the Established Church asked for its buildings to be excluded. I do not know what is going to happen to that state of affairs in the last third of the 20th century, but I humbly submit that it is unnecessary to have paragraph (	<i>b</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct to say that the form of his Amendment would exclude from directions under Clause 7(1) ecclesiastical buildings, a building which is the subject of a scheme or order under the enactments for the time being in force with respect to ancient monuments, and a building for the time being included in a list of monuments published by the Secretary of State under any such enactment. None of these classes is subject to listed building control and there are provisions elsewhere for the protection of those buildings. It would be anomalous to include them in the conservation provisions of the Bill when they are not in the listed historic building procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recollect that when discussing the Town and Country Planning Act, 1968, we considered why a church was a railway station, or why a railway station was a church. I cannot remember the answer, but it made a most entertaining debate.
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
There are special provisions to protect these buildings and to bring them into the conservation provisions when they are not within the listed historic buildings provisions would be quite anomalous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the Minister's point about ancient monuments and published lists of ancient monuments, but I wonder whether his remarks have equal force for an ecclesiastical building in use. Is there some statutory provision—possibly there is under some ecclesiastical jurisdiction—to prevent the demolition of a church?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, on a broader principle, although there may be this provision in other Statutes, a local planning authority might want to make a comprehensive order also, for example, a group of cottages surrounding a church. An essential point of the order is that it would be a comprehensive order. Instead of scratching about under different statutes to see which was listed and which was not, would there be any harm in their being categorised together in the way suggested by the hon. Gentleman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only repeat that there are historical reasons for the exclusion of churches from listed building controls. In respect of church buildings belonging to the Established Church, the Pastoral Measure, 1968, makes special provision for a form of control over church buildings, under which the question of architectural and historic interest is considered before there is any question of demolition. The churches requested that they be omitted from this provision and be dealt with under a separate form of control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not have thought that there was any danger of a church's being demolished without a conference between the parties concerned—the local planning authority and the church authorities within a conservation area. It would create considerable complications if we took this procedure out of the other special provisions made by the pastoral Measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's assurance that there would be complications, in view of the point made earlier about the difficulty of separating ecclesiastical buildings from ancient monuments. Based on my hon.

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 12, in page 8, line 36, leave out from "of" to "in" in line 37 and insert:

	<br><blockquote><p>"the buildings therein to which this section applies, or any one or more of those buildings, they may direct that the buildings or building".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment is suggested because doubt has been expressed whether the existing provisions of the Clause enable a local planning authority to make a direction in relation to all the buildings within the conservation area rather than to specify individual buildings. Originally the intention of the Clause was that the local authority would pick out certain terraces or blocks which were not listed as historic buildings but which related to the character of the conservation area. That would normally be the procedure, but no restriction was intended on the conservation of the whole area, or all the buildings within that area. The Amendment would make that quite clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this connection, I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Streatham (Mr. Sandys) for drawing the Government's attention to this doubt and asking us to make sure that it was removed.

	<p>Amendment No. 36, in Schedule 2, page 16, line 25, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or for the material external alteration".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all aware that this Clause seeks to control the demolition of
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
unlisted buildings, but the present situation is that under Article 3 and Schedule 1 to the Town and Country Planning General Development Order, 1963, certain limited types of development may take place without planning approval being required. In the past that has often resulted in buildings of some historical value being deprived of certain appurtances, such as cornices, mouldings and architectural details which cannot be replaced. This, when done, has resulted in a considerable devaluation of the property—not in terms of money but in terms of archaeological or architectural standards. Thus, when an application for demolition is ultimately made, most of the qualities of the place which would have prevented a demolition order being made have been removed. Consequently, the local authority is no longer able to consider the building on its architectural merits, because they no longer exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An Amendment to this effect was moved in another place. Lord Sandford, in rejecting the Amendment, said that where the alterations permitted development under Schedule 1 of the General Development Order, 1963, the planning authority could always recover control by making a direction under Article 4 of that order. The Secretary of State, in general, was favourably disposed towards approving such directions in conservation areas, provided the need could be demonstrated and local general support for such controls could be shown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first place, if one had one building, or perhaps two, I should have thought it exceedingly difficult to excite much local opinion in favour of the retention of a building, or a section of it. This, surely, must be a matter for the local authority to determine. We have recently heard much about referenda, and so forth, but one can just imagine a town poll on the question whether a building should be controlled by a local authority. It seems to me wrong to take regard of local support for an Article 4 direction. My Amendment seeks to give statutory control rather than having the matter dealt with by some 	<i>ad hoc</i> outside body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Cooper) has clearly stated the purpose of his Amendment, to which I have two objections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is designed to retain the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
character and appearance of the conservation area and not to preserve the value of any particular building. It should be a listed building if it needs that protection. The purpose of the Clause is to ensure that the buildings should not be demolished if their continued existence is important to the character or appearance of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause is not designed to protect the intrinsic merit or quality of individual buildings; that is the function of statutory listing. If it is important that the intrinsic quality of a building should be protected, statutory listing is the way to achieve it. So, by definition, the buildings caught by this control could be intrinsically of special interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly—and perhaps this is the more important point—the reason for giving the local planning authority this new power of control is that the demolition of a building does not normally constitute a development, and ordinary planning control does not apply to it. But alterations which materially affect the external appearance of a building constitute development and require planning permission. There is already control over such alterations, and the inclusion of alterations to buildings within the scope of the Clause would lead to unnecessary duplication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South spoke of certain alterations which can be made to a building under the general development order without planning consent, but consent is needed if the appearance of the building is altered. If it is necessary to protect the cornices or certain architectural aspects of the building, this is not the appropriate order; the building should be listed to protect those architectural aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general appearance is protected by the necessity to obtain planning permission for a change in a building's outward appearance. Under the present law it is not necessary to obtain permission for demolition; one can demolish without permission, but one cannot alter the appearance without permission. The Clause is designed to put this right. To extend the Clause further, to preserve the outward appearance of a building, would be a duplication of the existing law. I advise the Committee to resist the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have much
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
sympathy with the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Cooper) in moving the Amendments. The Minister has not replied to his hon. Friend with his usual skill. He argued that the Bill is designed to protect not an individual building but the amenities of an area, but the hon. Member for Ilford, South made it quite clear that if something were done to an individual building it could wreck the appearance of the whole block of buildings. The Minister's other point was more valid, when he said that planning consent is needed for a substantial alteration to a building, but I will put a case to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I live in the North-West, and much has been said in another Committee about my village of Hale. That village, together with many areas in Cheshire, has many beautiful thatched cottages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is Hale in a conservation area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but it would merit being in a conservation area. Hale will be going into Cheshire, thanks to the generosity of the Minister, and there are many conservation areas in Cheshire where there are thatched cottages. My right hon. Friend introduced a personal note when he referred to me earlier, so I take the opportunity to say that it is difficult to find thatchers in Cheshire. They seem to be busy doing other things these days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about coopers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would happen if it were decided that one of the cottages in a row of thatched cottages should no longer have a thatched roof because of the expense of thatching, or fire risk, or risk of vandalism—which, unfortunately, does occur with thatched cottages? I am sure that one would not need planning consent not to thatch one's roof, yet it would ruin the whole effect if one of a row of thatched cottages were not to have a thatched roof. If local authorities are to exercise the power under the hon. Gentleman's Amendment there should be a corresponding financial provision for the costs of the owner concerned. If the public are to enjoy the beauty and amenity of a thatched roof, help should be given towards the cost of thatching. Planning consent would not be required not to thatch the roof. The row
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
of cottages might be included in a conservation area under the Clause, and nothing could be done if one cottage were not thatched, whereas the hon. Gentleman's Amendment would provide some control over that situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cooper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause is not strictly designed to set up these conservation areas. Conservation areas are set up already. The Clause seeks to control the demolition of buildings within a conservation area. The burden of my argument was that under the 1963 Act, notwithstanding the conservation areas, certain things could be done without planning approval and that, in consequence, a local authority would find it difficult to resist an application for demolition of a property, whereas my Amendment would not permit such depredations to property without prior approval from the local authority. Unless I have a better reply from my hon. Friend, I regret that I shall have to press the Amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw my hon. Friend's attention to the words of the Clause. Subsection (2) provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it appears to a local planning authority in England or Wales that, in the interests of preserving the character or apearance of any part of their area which is for the time being a conservation area."</p></blockquote>
and so on. It is to protect "the character or appearance" of any part of that area. Alterations which materially affect the external appearance of a building constitute development, and require planning permission. There would be duplication if the Amendments were accepted. Section 22 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, provides that development includes work which materially affects the external appearance of a building; that is development, and needs planning permission. Whenever the exterior of a building is altered, whether in a conservation area or outside a conservation area, planning permission is required. Existing planning law provides this protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause is necessary because under planning law there is no protection against the demolition of a building. Demolition was not considered to be development. Changing the external appearance of a building is considered to be development. The example given by the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) of replacing a thatched roof by a tiled roof is definitely
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
development, and needs planning permission. My wife threatened to do it at our house in Highgate, and I assured her that planning permission was needed to put a thatched roof in place of a tiled roof on a terrace in Highgate. I think that it would look very nice—I used to live in a thatched house in the country—but undoubtedly the change of one type of roof to another is defined as development, in the same way as changing the whole external appearance of the building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South that that protection already exists, and that any change in the external appearance of the buildings would require planning permission, whether or not they are in a conservation area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 15, in page 9, line 10, leave out from "subsection" to end of line 14 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"which shall require confirmation by the Secretary of State and shall not take effect until confirmed, revoke any direction under subsection (2) above, or vary any such direction so as to exclude any building or buildings therefrom".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we are to discuss Amendment No. 22, in Clause 8, page 10, line 29, leave out from "subsection" to "revoke" in line 31 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"which shall require confirmation by the Secretary of State and shall not take effect until confirmed".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Clause stands, its purpose it to give power to local planning authorities to protect buildings in conservation areas by providing that there should be permission before demolition. They do this under subsection (2) by making a direction. They submit it under subsection (3) to the Secretary of State for confirmation. The point is that they have to obtain the confirmation of the Secretary of State ultimately if not initially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they want to revoke this direction that must be confirmed by the Secretary of State. If they want to modify or vary it in any way by excluding a building or buildings under the direction made, they can do it without any confirmation by the Secretary of State. That seems anomalous, and my Amendment seeks to alter the position so that any revocation or varia-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
tion must be confirmed by the Secretary of State in the same way that the direction must ultimately be confirmed by him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could understand it if local authorities were given power to protect these buildings and conservation areas without the need for confirmation by the Secretary of State—in fact, I would support that—but since they have to obtain confirmation they ought to do so for revocation or future modification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that Amendment No. 19 is not to be called, but it is important to give names to the buildings which will be protected under the Clause. For want of a better suggestion, I ask my hon. Friend to consider the phrase, "conservation area protected building" because there might be confusion in the operation of the law as we hope it will come on to the statute book shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Mr. Sydney Chapman) has explained, the effect of the Amendment would be to require the Secretary of State's confirmation to the revocation of a direction made under subsection (2) or its variations to exclude a building. The basis of his argument is: if the order itself needs confirmation, why should not the revocation also need confirmation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At first glance the Amendment seems reasonable. A direction needs confirmation, so why should not a revocation or variation also need it? It is necessary to consider two points—first, the reason why confirmation of a direction is considered necessary and, secondly, what the practical effects of the Amendment would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Designation of a conservation area does not require Ministerial approval; it is merely confirmation of it. It seems right that if a local planning authority proposes to follow designation by a direction which may seriously affect the rights of owners of property there should be some form of central oversight to ensure that it is not used unreasonably. That does not mean that central Government is behaving like "Big Brother", but that the designation of a conservation area is depriving certain people of their proprietary rights in dealing with their property as they choose. Consequently, it is thought right that there should be confirmation of the local authority's actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
Further, since control over buildings of special architectural or historic interest requires Ministerial approval it would be wrong to allow a modified form of that control to be applied to buildings of lesser merit without Ministerial approval. If there is to be confirmation of a listed building order, including buildings of considerable intrinsic value, it is not right to take away property rights of buildings of lesser value by an unconfirmed order of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So much for the reason for confirmation. None of these considerations apply to revocation. We are removing the restrictions on property rights and allowing the property to be dealt with in accordance with the ordinary law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The practical effect of the Amendment will be negligible. If confirmation were required to the revocation of a direction, and it was withheld in a specific case, the local planning authority could easily and quickly circumvent the refusal by granting the demolition consent when an application was made. The Secretary of State would then have no power to intervene in that decision. It would be rather ridiculous to insert this provision in the Bill when the whole matter can be shortcircuited by the local planning authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising the point, which at first glance seems reasonable, but after looking at it more closely I have concluded that there is good reason for allowing a revocation without the need to apply to the Secretary of State for confirmation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for those remarks. My purpose in putting forward the Amendment was to try to underline one of the problems that we are facing in matters of conservation. The local planning authority, in effect, becomes the sole arbiter in deciding the fate of the buildings that we want to protect in conservation areas. This raises the wider question whether at some future time there ought to be much stronger legislation to protect these buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, bearing in mind what my hon. Friend has said, that in any case permission for demolition can be given, and that the Clause states only that owners of certain buildings have to obtain permission before demolition—since it is in the hands of the local planning authorities themselves to decide whether permission should
