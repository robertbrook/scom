<div class='page-header'><h1>LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL</h1></div>
<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Mr. David Gibson-Watt)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the permission of the Committee, I should like to make a short personal statement. I have an apology to make to the Committee, which is that in the post this morning hon. Members found a copy of a letter which I sent to my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and Development. Through an oversight I sent a copy of this letter to all right hon. and hon. Gentlemen on the Committee. This was not an overt example of open Government, Mrs. Butler. It was a technical mistake, which I thought it right to report to the Committee as soon as possible. The letter refers to Welsh Office views about proposals for community councils in Wales.<br><br>
The letter is part of inter-Departmental exchanges, which it is not normal to circulate to all members of a Standing Committee. At the same time as I offer my apology to members of the Committee for any inconvenience that I have caused them, I naturally extend this apology to my hon. Friends the Minister and the Under-Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</span> <i>rose.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There can be no discussion on a personal statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a personal statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman should have given notice that he wished to make a personal statement. However, I will permit it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say that never' in my time at the Welsh Office, would I have taken anyone into my confidence to the extent that I have been taken into confidence. I much appreciate the civilised attitude existing on the other side of the Committee.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
ORDINARY DAY OF ELECTION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment No. 644 proposed</i>—(<i>this day</i>)—in page 23, line 13, leave out "April or" and insert "the first week of".—[<i>Mr. John Silkin.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Richard Sharples)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned I was about to respond to the right hon. Gentleman. I take note of all his points. These will be considered when the discussion takes place with the local authority associations. I only enter the caveat that in binding ourselves too closely by Act of Parliament, which it is difficult to alter, we may run into trouble at some unforeseen date in the future. There are arguments on both sides but I hope that, having said that, the hon. Member will see fit to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the Minister of State. He has made a very fair point which I wholeheartedly accept. In the spirit of benevolent, open diplomacy which all of us applaud, and in the confident belief that the Minister will do his part, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

Clause 46</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
OMISSION TO HOLD ELECTION OR ELECTION VOID</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 711, in page 23, line 26, after "held" insert "within thirty days".<br><br>
The purpose of the Amendment is to obtain some degree of uniformity in the case of the election of a councillor to fill an unfilled vacancy. I am conscious, in moving the Amendment, that in some ways the electoral law seems to be at variance, because Section 13(1,<i>a</i>) of the Representation of the People Act, 1969 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"At a Parliamentary election the returning officer shall countermand notice of the poll or, if polling has begun, direct that the poll be abandoned, and all proceedings with reference to the election shall be commenced afresh in all respects as if the writ had been received twenty-eight days
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0691">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1271</span>
after the day on which proof was given to the returning officer of the death except that—"</p></blockquote>
and there are a couple of exceptions. This could, in parliamentary elections, mean a delay of about seven weeks. The only point I want to make is that the electoral law seems rather diffuse and lacking in uniformity.<br><br>
The fact is that the proposed Clause without amendment more or less repeats the existing law as far as local government elections are concerned, and I have been informed that problems have arisen where a local officer has refused or, I suppose, in some cases neglected to call an election in the circumstances outlined in subsection (1) of Clause 46.<br><br>
I am also advised that delays of three or more months have sometimes occurred. It seems, therefore, that one ought to examine this more closely and see whether avoidable delays can be avoided.<br><br>
If one looks at Clause 90 of the Bill—and, before you rule me out of order, Mrs. Butler, I must point out that it is highly germane to my argument—one sees the following in subsection (1):
<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to the provisions of this section, on a casual vacancy occurring in the office of councillor for any principal area, an election to fill the vacancy shall be held—
<ol>
<li>in a case in which the High Court or the council have declared the office to be vacant, within thirty days from the date of the declaration;</li>
<li>in any other case, within thirty days after notice in writing of the vacancy has been given to the proper officer of the authority by two local government electors for the area."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Then this subsection is followed by another subsection which takes into account Sundays, Christmas breaks, Easter breaks and bank holidays, which could bring it up to something like five weeks.<br><br>
By the Amendment I am trying to tidy up local government law a little by making it uniform, with 30 days throughout, though clearly if the Minister of State were minded to accept my Amendment, I suppose one would have to have some provision as in Clause 90 to deal with the Christmas break, the Easter break and the Bank Holiday. However, as I have said on about 500 occasions in this Committee, it is not my job to act as an unpaid draftsman. I do not think that it would present any great difficulty.<br><br>
There is something to be said for making a uniform local government electoral law. At the risk of straying
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1272</span>
outside the realms of this Bill, I would point out that there is much to be said for assimilating all electoral law in this respect. Bearing in mind that the Representation of the People Act, 1969, can be studied at leisure, I rest my case on a total assimilation—a logical assimilation—within the terms of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say straight away that I accept the right hon. Gentleman's argument in principle. He is right on this point. For the reasons he gave, however, I could not advise the Committee to accept the Amendment as it stands. Certain matters have to be gone into. There is the problem of the candidate who dies just before polling day. It may be difficult to find another candidate and arrange an election within 30 days.<br><br>
There is also the question of the relationship with Clause 90. If we accepted the Amendment it would be necessary to tie this Clause up in the same way, with the same kind of criteria, as is laid down in Clause 90, in relation to Bank Holidays, Christmas Day and similar occasions. With the agreement of the right hon. Gentleman, I should like to put this proposition to the local authority associations through the machinery for discussion which we have. Provided there are no strong objections from them I undertake to table an Amendment on Report to implement this proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State could hardly be more fair or more forthcoming than he has been. In that spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 648, in page 23, line 29, leave out "or vice-chairman".<br><br>
This is purely a drafting Amendment. Subsection (2) deals with the action to be taken when election to an office under the Act fails for any reason. It is appropriate that parish offices should be excluded, but the office of vice-chairman is not one of these, because the vice-chairman is appointed under Clauses 16(4) and 36(4), and not elected. The reference to him should accordingly be taken out of the Bill.</span></p>

SUPPLEMENTAL</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 649, in page 24, line 31, at end add:
<br><blockquote><p>"and 'registration officer' has the same meaning as in that Act".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the Amendment is to make it clear beyond doubt that the registration officer to be appointed by every district and London borough council under Clause 41 is the electoral registration officer for the purposes of the Representation of the People Act, 1949. This is purely for clarification.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not really want to make a point. I wish only to ask a question. I looked at it, probably rather dimly, perhaps because it is afternoon, and I could not see that the Amendment was as necessary as the Minister of State thinks. The Clause seems fairly clear without it. Perhaps the Minister could give us a few more words of explanation why he thinks there is any doubt about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised by the parliamentary draftsman that it is necessary in order to be clear, and I should not like to dispute his advice in any way.</span></p>

AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATION OF ELECTION LAW</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment No. 650 proposed:</i> In page 216, leave out lines 12 to 15 and insert:
<ol>
<li>both are in the same constituency; or</li>
<li>both are within the area of the same parish in England or the same community in Wales.</li></ol>
<br><blockquote><p>7. In section 18(2) (notice of duties reserved by the returning officer) for the words "the foregoing subsection" there shall be substituted the words "subsection (1A) of this section".—[<i>Mr. Graham Page.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Amendment No. 645, in page 216, line 13, at end insert "and the same constituency".</span></p>
<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged. These
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1274</span>
are two distinct Amendments, tabled together only because new paragraph 7 in Schedule 6 has to be inserted immediately after the amended paragraph 6. The amended paragraph 6 seeks to retain the facility provided by Section 6(1) of the Representation of the People Act, 1969. For the purpose of voting by post, two addresses are to be regarded as being in the same area if they are within the same constituency. That meets the point contained in Amendment No. 645, in the name of the right hon. Gentleman. This does not affect rural electors, but it will save urban electors having to travel across a large new district in order to vote in their former home area, just as the 1969 Act provisions saved them from having to travel across a large borough.<br><br>
The new paragraph 7 deals with a possible ambiguity in Section 18(2) of the 1949 Act, and makes it clear that it is subsection (1A,<i>b</i>) which is referred to in that Section. It is purely for clarification. Perhaps I may summarise: the first part of the Government's Amendment meets the point contained in Amendment No. 645, in the name of the right hon. Gentleman, and the second part is purely for clarification.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Edmund Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether Amendment No. 650 achieves exactly what the Minister of State intends. If one looks carefully and thinks very closely about the logic of the "or" which is to be inserted between subparagraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), one sees that two addresses will be regarded as being within the same area, from the point of view of postal voting, if they are just within the same constituency. I appreciate that this has been introduced to help in the case of a divided borough, with a number of constituencies within it, but I am particularly aware of the way that this would affect a constituency such as mine, which is a county constituency made up of no fewer than five district authorities, stretching for about 40 miles from one end to the other. If some of my constituents move, say, from the village of Monk Fryston to the village of Hatfield 30 or 40 miles away, as I read this Amendment and look closely at the logic of the "or" between (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), such people would not be able to claim postal voting facilities for a parliamentary election. I wonder whether the intention of the Amendment has not been carried out in its wording.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0693">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1275</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would have been happy to move this Amendment because we attach great importance to it, and there is now general all-party agreement. The Minister of State has now confirmed that this was a re-enactment of the former provision under which, in a divided borough, the old provision which we objected to—that one could only have a postal vote if one had moved out of the local district council area—had now gone, and one could now have a postal vote if one moved from one constituency to another after the due date on which one is qualified to be on the electoral register. This is of great importance in areas where there is a lot of slum clearance and tremendous change in population in the centre of our cities. This is why we hope that this is what the Minister is agreeing to in his Amendment No. 650.<br><br>
My hon. Friend has raised another point which is relevant to the situation of rural districts, which also needs to be cleared up, and I hope the Minister of State will be able to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to consider the technical point raised by the hon. Gentleman. If it is necessary to make any further alteration between now and Report I will certainly do so, but the intention as I described it is quite clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made a reasonable offer, and I am most grateful to him. Will he confirm what I said, that when a person in a divided borough now moves from one constituency to another, he will without any question be qualified to have a postal vote?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I confirm that.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this Schedule, as amended, be the Sixth Schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we agree to Schedule 6, may I be permitted to refer to a problem involving the registration of electors referred to in the first four paragraphs of this Schedule. I have been corresponding with the Minister of State on this problem, and I am grateful for his attention.<br><br>
I refer to the way in which the present law permits electoral registration in respect of more than one address. The way in which this works out in terms of elections
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1276</span>
is that if a person is registered for more than one address in more than one local government area, he is able to vote at the local government elections in both areas. With regard to parliamentary elections, a person registered for more than one address is legally only allowed to vote at a general election in respect of one constituency. I understand that no arrangements are made to make sure that this provision is not infringed—that the person concerned does not exercise his right to vote in respect of more than one constituency.<br><br>
I am also concerned that a person registered in respect of more than one address may exercise his vote in a constituency where a by-election occurs if one of his registered addresses is in that constituency. This means that if that person recorded his vote in another constituency at the previous General Election—thereby assisting in the election of a Member already serving in the House of Commons—at the by-election he could take part in the election of a further Member. Indeed, if, by a quirk of coincidence, two such constituencies happened to have by-elections on the same day that person could vote in both by-elections. Presumably one of them would have to be a postal vote, but the person concerned would still be able to help elect—or otherwise—two Members of the House of Commons.<br><br>
That infringes the whole democratic principle of "one man, one vote". I agree that it is difficult to get round the existing anomalies, but this matter requires further attention. People should have to decide at the time of registration where they wish to exercise their vote for the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point which the hon. Gentleman has raised is a very wide one, covering the whole question of dual registration. I agree that there are certain anomalies in that question, which I am sure we will wish to examine. I do not think that this Standing Committee, today, provides the right place and time to do this, because it raises the wide questions of the right to register and the right to vote in parliamentary elections—a matter that I have under consideration at the moment. I do not want to go further than that at this stage.<br><br>
On the question of a person's voting twice in a General Election, it is clear that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0694">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1277</span>
that is a serious contravention of the law. If someone is found doing this the penalties are severe. It is right to emphasise that in this Standing Committee, and to take every opportunity of doing so. On the wider question which the hon. Gentleman touched upon, I agree that there is a problem which may need consideration, but for reasons which the right hon. Member will understand I do not wish to go further than I have gone this afternoon.</span></p>
