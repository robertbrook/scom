	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved</i>,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Bill [	<i>Lords</i>] the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. Graham Page.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before calling the first Amendment, I remind the Committee that there are two Financial Resolutions in connection with the Bill. In the last line of the first the words, "that other enactment" should read, "any other enactment". That will be corrected in the records of the House.

Adequate notice should be given of Amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call manuscript Amendments. The provisional selection and grouping of Amendments is contained in a list which I have made available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>PROVISION FOR JOINT SURVEYS, REPORTS AND STRUCTURE PLANS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should welcome some comment from the Minister on the Clause. We are in general agreement with its provisions, but we should like to know a little more about the way in which joint surveys will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I was a member of the Standing Committee that considered the previous Town and Country Planning Act, I am surprised to find that that Act did not provide these powers. Would the Minister say whether they should also be provided in connection with local plans as well as the wider structure plans? There may be occasions when such powers would be needed—they may already exist, but I doubt it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
One or two points of a detailed character have been raised by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The Institution says that the provisions:
	<br><blockquote><p>"enable voluntary combinations by planning authorities for the purposes of surveys and preparation of structure plans. The Institution considers it essential, however, that such a voluntary combination should be formalised by the setting up of a joint planning committee to keep the structure plan under review and to consider proposals for development of a specially significant character."</p></blockquote>
Again, we should be interested to hear the Minister's views on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for the length of Clause 1 and for the fact that we are apparently making heavy weather of a short point. However, together, I am sure, with other members of the Committee, I detest legislation by reference. I thought, therefore, that it would be preferable to write out an entirely new Clause rather than to employ the use of cross-references. This has turned out to be a rather long Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) and I should reprimand ourselves for not noticing that fact. Although we both served on the Committee stage of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1968, we failed to realise that the wording was such that a structure plan, although it could be prepared by two or more local planning authorities, must be submitted to the Secretary of State for approval in the form of a structure plan by one local planning authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, the ridiculous situation arises whereby several local authorities which may join together to create a structure plan—for example, in Hampshire, where Southampton, Portsmouth and Hampshire are joining together in a structure plan for South Hants—must, under present law, take a pair of scissors and chop it up into separate plans for submission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It goes deeper than that. We do not wish to deter local planning authorities from joining together and deciding that a structure plan should be drawn for the whole of their area. It may well be that, according to the terms of the Local Government Bill, this will not be so necessary in future, having regard to the larger local planning authorities which will come into effect after 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
Nevertheless, we have permitted local planning authorities to initiate their structure plans in a number of areas, and we are arranging a phasing of the submission of structure plans from the local planning authorities to the Secretary of State. Thus, this work is already being undertaken, for it was not possible to wait for local government reorganisation to provide the impetus. Clause 1, therefore, authorises local planning authorities to join together to draw up and eventually submit to the Secretary of State one structure plan covering several areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chartered surveyors suggest that there should be some formal joint planning committee. I should have thought that that was unnecessary, taking into account that considerable powers exist for local planning authorities to set up a joint board, or joint committee, to review and monitor a plan, and to watch developments that may affect it. I do not consider it necessary, therefore, for special provision to be incorporated into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it is unnecessary, because of the very term "local plan", dealing with a locality, to provide, as in the case of structure plans, for two local planning authorities to join together. Such provision is necessary in the case of the structure plan as there are a number of places in the country where two or more local planning authorities will wish to join together. However, I do not think that that will be the case with regard to local plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman quite certain of that? The more I consider the matter, the more I think that it may arise. The chartered surveyors also raised this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that provision is made for Greater London and it may well be found that problems will arise. For example, in the metropolitan counties, which in our opinion are tightly drawn, problems may well arise in relation to a new metropolitan county and areas outside it and the districts within it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Shields is right about London. There are specific provisions for joint local plans for Greater London. They appear again in our re-written Schedule, which we shall discuss later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fall back on a Clause which you, Sir Stephen, and a number of members of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
the Committee know only too well. Unfortunately, it has changed its number. It is our famous Clause 100 in the Local Government Bill, now Clause 101, and it is under that Clause that local planning authorities will have power, somewhat indirectly, to join to prepare local plans if they so wish. I do not think that any specific provision in this Bill is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take the question of local plans a little further, not in any pedantic sense and not because I believe that the Minister has forgotten about the point and disregarded it—Ministers do not do that in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop), if it is necessary for Greater London—and I agree that it is—surely it is because of this issue: how local is "local"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a London Member, I can think of areas in my constituency which neighbour, say, Bermondsey, or Peckham, or Greenwich. But in the first two places, demonstrably, a local plan is something that ought to be defined as a matter in which my council and the neighbouring council should work together. There are even areas which, historically, Deptford claims from Greenwich, and we think we were badly treated in the late nineteenth century when they stole it from us and gave it to Greenwich—but that is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, to the people living in the area, it is one area. I am therefore delighted that the Minister has given power for this to happen in London. As I have often said, I am a Londoner, but surely what applies here must apply in many other parts of the country. How local is "local"? I remember the Minister of State for the Home Office, in a previous discussion, saying that there was a definite, if not an infinite, boundary which marked the end of his constituency and that boundary was marked by a river. We are not all fortunate enough to have rivers or brooks clearly demarcating the difference between one borough or district and another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is sauce for the London goose, one would expect it to be sauce for the provincial gander, too. I hope that the Minister will consider this again. We do not want to make a long speech about it.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
If we had wished to argue it at length, we should have suggested an Amendment. We merely thought that on the whole he had not given quite as much weight to the situation in other areas as he clearly has in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry, like him, that our old Clause 100 in the Local Government Bill is renumbered as Clause 101—it does not sound right. That Clause would apply equally to the structure plan itself. What that Clause says is that two or more local authorities may combine. If that is so, Clause 1 of this Bill is unnecessary, according to the Minister's logic. He is saying, "There may be a balance, but don't worry, for Clause 101 will take care of local plans." On the same argument, Clause 101 will take care of structure plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is no spirit of criticism, but partly thinking aloud and trying to be constructively helpful that the Opposition raise this matter. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) has a wider comment to make. From what he has been telling me, it may have been heard before. However, perhaps familiarity will breed not contempt but respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with procedure on the Clause, and rightly so. We should like the Minister to know that we commend the Clause and are grateful to him for it. There is no dispute about that. But have we got the timing right? It seems, to some of those who have spoken about it, that the basis would have been more effective if the examination of issues differed from a hearing of objections—not only on the question of procedure but on timing itself. In other words, if the examination took place as soon as possible after alternative strategies had been formulated by the planning authority, but before that authority had committed itself definitely to the defence of its chosen strategy, there might be greater advantage to it. Final policies would be settled in the light of discussion before the panel, and that would, perhaps, be of greater moment in what is a new, though important, procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to labour the rest of the argument. The local planning authority ought to signify a preferred strategy to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
start with rather than one to which it is strongly committed, so that one could deal with that in perspective before too many positions had become firmly entrenched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally—though this might be a derogation from what I have just said—I hope that, when the structure plan and its procedures are dealt with, there will not be too much detail. It is important to decide whether such-and-such an area of land should be zoned residential, but at this stage I should think it totally wrong to decide what the density should be, for example, 10 to an acre or 8 to an acre. That should be left to the local plan and be dealt with in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, these are not criticisms. They are thoughts—perhaps a little incoherent—which arise as we examine the Clause. The Opposition commend the new basis of the Clause and wish it well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my right hon. Friend in welcoming the Clause. The necessity for it arose from an oversight, in that joint structure plans could not be submitted to the Minister. It would seem that the purpose and need for Clause 1 is not merely to enable local authorities to combine to discuss and formulate a plan. They can do that in any event, as the Minister rightly says, under Clause 101 of the Local Government Bill. The necessity for Clause 1 arises because the actual submission to the Secretary of State cannot be a joint submission but must come from each separate authority. Therefore, it is not the combining together to discuss; it is the actual act of submission that makes Clause 1 necessary in regard to structure plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the points on local plans discussed by my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop), at first sight one would think that the purpose of the Bill is to speed up procedure, and local plans will be dealt with at local level. Therefore, the need to submit to the Secretary of State should not be a part of Clause 1. That was the way I was thinking. But we have paragraph 7 of Schedule 1. As my right hon. Friend says, the whole of Schedule 1 is devoted to creating a structure of local plan combination for the London boroughs. I take his point further. If that is desirable for London, it is equally desirable elsewhere, at least in the metropolitan areas. I cannot see what
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
the difference would be between London boroughs combing for a local plan and metropolitan districts in Birmingham, in Manchester or in Liverpool, where the same conditions apply, doing the same. One side of a sheet can be in one metropolitan district; the other side in another. It is eminently suitable to extend what the Minister has rightly done in Schedule 1 for London to metropolitan districts. I agree that this probably is not necessary in non-metropolitan districts. But in metropolitan districts, the same conditions apply. Therefore, if the provision is necessary for London—I should have doubted it, because local plans normally should not go to the Secretary of State—it is equally necessary in a metropolitan district area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other point was discussed a great deal in the House and in Committee during our erstwhile existence in this room on the Local Government Bill. The combination of local authorities, of counties, to get together on structure plans is, obviously, thought desirable. It is another step in the inexorable wave on towards regionalism. In many Clauses of the Bill, the Government are allowing local authorities to combine because they realise that there is a level where no local government structure exists but there is need for such a structure to exist. Because it does not exist, the Clauses must be brought in, not only for planning, but for many other matters, to allow local authorities to act as though there was a region. Of course, a region would be an entity in itself and could plan much better than the 	<i>"ad hoc-ery</i>", to take the phrase used on another Bill, of joint committees trying to do it in this way. Eventually, the Government will see the need for a proper regional structure to do jobs such as the one this Bill encourages local authorities to combine to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Marks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I emphasise what my hon. Firend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) has said about the comparison between the other metropolitan areas and London. I am sure that people will want to know why the metropolitan area of London is treated in one way and the other metropolitan areas in another. Those of us who live in and represent the other metropolitan areas may have an exaggerated idea of their importance. Once the Lord Mayor of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Manchester was asked by the Lord Mayors of Liverpool and Birmingham which he thought was the second greatest city in the country, and he said that he always thought that it was London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As one who lives in London for four or five days a week and in another metropolitan area for two or three days a week, I see many of their problems as identical. Reading the local papers in Wandsworth and Putney and reading the local papers in my constituency, one sees precisely the same arguments about planning. At the moment, my own constituency is partly in the city of Manchester and partly just outside it. After reorganisation, it will be partly in one metropolitan district of greater Manchester and partly in another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be told the reason why, apart from size, London, is regarded as so different from these other great complexes of industry and social and economic problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take, first, the point raised by the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) about consideration of the alternative strategies at an early stage before views harden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It occurred to me that in a desire to save time, I may have spoken in shorthand and not put the point clearly. Where one has authorities combining, the tendency is for them to have a firm commitment before they do anything else. That is natural. Therefore, it is more important and appropriate to talk about it here than at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I see the point, that there will not be the same public participation when two or more local planning authorities combine on surveys, reports and structure plans as there would be if only one local planning authority dealt with them. To take the example of South Hampshire, where public participation has been experimental to a great extent, there has been thorough public participation carried out jointly by the three authorities concerned, the county and the two county boroughs. I do not think there is likely to be less participation and consideration of the alternatives at an early stage under the joint structure plan preparation than there would be if one local authority were preparing the plan.

It put it in the same way as he has done, that it did not want views to harden before the public had had an opportunity to express their opinion on the alternatives, and suggested that there might be two stages of consideration: an examination of several alternatives, and finally an examination of the preferred strategy. But it came down against that suggestion because, if there is good public participation at the outset, one examination of the preferred strategy would be the correct way to deal with the matter. The point goes wider than Clause 1, although I see that the Clause might prevent the sort of public participation desired by us all, and which was described in the Act of 1968.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, I come to the question of local plans. The point raised is valid, and I shall certainly consider it again. The provision arrived in the Bill in a historical way. It was evident, as we gave permission for structure plans to be prepared, that there was this fault in the 1968 Act. That occurred at a time before the Local Government Bill had been drafted. Consequently, the fault was put right in the drafting of the Town and Country Planning Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be remembered that the Local Government Bill does not deal with the functions of government of London, though it deals with greater London in certain respects, such as the constitution of London. Therefore, whereas the Local Government Bill provides for local planning authorities to join together in many functions, including that of drawing local plans, it does not apply to London. When we came to draft the Schedule applying to greater London, it was thought wise to bring into it the provision for joint local plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see at once that this may cause some confusion. The power for greater London is spelled out at some length in one Bill, with a good procedure for it, whereas the power is provided for the rest of the country, indirectly, in Clause 101 of the Local Government Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to look at that again, to see whether we ought to bring it all into the Town and Country Planning Bill and say specifically that the same applies throughout the country, If I did that, I should not restrict it to the metropolitan
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
areas, as the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) suggested, thinking aloud. As we know from our discussions on the Local Government Bill, there are many areas close to metropolitan area status, like South Hampshire, where the provision should apply. I shall, therefore, look at it again, to consider whether to incorporate it into this Bill, to obviate the necessity for people to search through another Bill to find out whether it can be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for the Minister's comments. I believe that it would be helpful if he could look at the point again. We on this side will look again at the other question that I raised. I should have added, for clarification, that there was some concern about whether, in addition to the submission of joint proposals, consideration would be given jointly. I assume that that would be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has referred to the views of the Town and Country Planning Association. I have certain connections with that Association, as does the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Allason), who serves on its executive committee. Although it is true that the Association made suggestions, it was anxious that the whole views of a planning authority should not be fixed and determined at the stage when the new kind of examination takes place. That is still the Association's feeling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one stage, the Association was considering whether that point should be written into the Bill. It hopes that it will still be possible at that examination stage for more than one proposition to be put forward. Perhaps we could look at this again on Clause 3. I did not want the Minister's comment to go without raising that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious that it should be clearly understood that that examination—that discussion, which is what I hope it will be—can freely take place on the assumption that those adding their views may feel that they can have some effect. We do not want an empty procedure, nor do we want a purely legalistic procedure. There should be a real exchange of views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PROVISION FOR WITHDRAWAL OF STRUCTURE PLANS, AND AS TO EFFECT OF STEPS TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH PLANS WITHDRAWN OR NOT SUBMITTED</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have no objection to Clause 2, designed, as it is, to enable the speedy withdrawal of a plan or the submission of another plan. However, I foresee one difficulty under the Clause as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authorities together may make application to the Secretary of State for withdrawal of a plan. That is understandable. The Secretary of State then withdraws it. But the Clause says, "or any of them". What would arise where a joint structure plan was submitted and then the two or more local authorities fall out over it? One authority might say to the Minister, "We want this plan to be withdrawn". Under the Clause, as I understand it, the whole plan must be withdrawn and another plan submitted by the authorities concerned. In other words, one local authority can rock the boat by itself applying for the withdrawal of the plan. It may not arise, because local bodies are sensible, but it could.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the Minister has seen the possible consequences of that arising in the future. It would cause the expense, delay and frustration which he is trying to prevent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not aware of the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), but it makes a great deal of sense. An enormous amount of public time, money, and energy may have been expended. The Secretary of State has outlined exactly what he wishes to be considered. All the long processes which we associate with the previous procedure have been set in motion. But at that point, as my hon. Friend says, if one of a number of local planning authorities decides that it has had enough and simply comes out of it, all the work will have been wasted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When submitting a joint plan to the Secretary of State, the local planning authorities concerned must set out what action has been taken over surveys and over public participation. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
end of subsection (3) of the new Clause 10B which is introduced by Clause 2 in the Bill provides for the Secretary of State to say that, in the preparation of any future plan, all that public participation which has occurred in preparing the joint plan should be taken to apply. Thus, all the work on the joint plan need not be wasted. It can be treated as the public participation in preparation for the further plan—it can be, and I stress "can".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most obliged to the Minister. I accept what he says, but the wording is so strong in lines 11 and 12 of subsection (1):
	<br><blockquote><p>"… and shall in that event be treated as never having been submitted."</p></blockquote>
that seems to be saying that one must not consider it at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not like the Secretary of State to be put in the position of arbitrator here and say that one shall not withdraw a plan if a local authority wants to. What he can do is mitigate the damage done by that withdrawal by saying, "If one wants to prepare another plan, or if his partner wants to continue, I shall treat all the work that has been done as work for the new plans which will be submitted." Then one will not have to go over it all again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong to ask the Secretary of State to order the plan to remain submitted if a local planning authority wanted to revise it, do it again, and not have it as a joint plan. I think that we should leave it to the good sense of the authorities concerned and of the Secretary of State. If local planning authorities become irritated with each other, it will behove the Secretary of State to try to smooth things over and do the best he can for the areas concerned—but not by any order or "Big Brother" stuff—in the hope that the local planning authorities will act sensibly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two local authorities may quarrel with one another in these circumstances. If they get as far as working together on a structure plan, they are unlikely to quarrel on that basis, but political control may change, and what one political party regards as a desirable basis for a structure plan another may regard as totally unsuitable. That kind of thing does happen. We have seen some quite dramatic changes in political control in local elections in the past few years which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
can have a great effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more I think about the brain-child of my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes, the more I think there is something in it. Will the Minister look again at "shall" in line 11? Perhaps "may" should be put in its place. He would then have the best of both worlds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Derek Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to assist the ratiocinative processes which my hon. Friend has been invited to apply in nurturing the brain-child which the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) has produced for the inspection and appropriate admiration of the Committee. I come to the matter not with a fresh mind, having regard to my overnight labours of the last two nights on another matter, but at any rate with an open—though not vacant—mind. I wonder whether there is a major difficulty here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appropriate for the hon. Member for Widnes to draw attention to the mandatory terms in which lines 11 and 12 of the new Section 10B of the 1971 Act will be framed. One would think that the reason for the mandatory terms, and the permissive terms of the last few lines of subsection (3)—the other matter to which the hon. Gentleman draws attention—is that the structure plan will finally be a document having the force of law. There is considerable virtue in making clear beyond a peradventure that a plan with which a local planning authority, in its wisdom and discretion, decides it does not wish to proceed should not have any status thereafter. That, I take it, is the purpose of lines 10 and 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the various steps set out in Section 8 of the 1971 Act—the publicity, representations and so on—would be immaterial only if, in withdrawing their structure plan, the authorities were substituting a new structure plan different in every respect. That is unlikely. It is more likely that, though they wished to withdraw and substitute another, there would be an area of common ground between them, and some of the steps taken under Section 8 would still be material. In order to save duplication and, possibly, from a logistical point of view, resources, too, there is still that saving provision in subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is how it strikes me, and, with respect to the right hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
Deptford (Mr. John Silkin), the substitution of "may" for "shall" would not help much in this context. As the right hon. Gentleman knows from his legal and distinguished Parliamentary experience, "may" and "shall" are dangerous words in statutes and give rise to controversies as to whether there is a power coupled with a duty. The right hon. Gentleman will recall, from the Bishop of Oxford case and other matters, that "shall" has the advantage of being clear and mandatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those few words have assisted the right hon. Gentleman in his consideration of what I unequivocally recognise as a proper point brought to the Committee's attention in a temperate and constructive way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) put his finger on the point which made me hesitate to agree to make it not mandatory, as it is in the Clause as drafted. In the event of there being an alteration in the political affiliations of the local planning authority, in my opinion it would be wholly wrong for a Secretary of State to say, "You shall keep this plan. You shall not withdraw it. You must go through the elaborate business of altering the plan. I shall continue to consider it as you have submitted it. You will now submit all kinds of alterations. I shall make the situation uncomfortable for you, simply because your political affiliations have changed".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should prefer the Secretary of State to remain outside the matter. If a local planning authority is not satisfied with the plan which it submitted, or if it changes its political colour and wishes to submit a new plan, let it decide whether the plan should be withdrawn altogether or whether the alterations are small enough to incorporate into the existing plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, while I am prepared, as always, to look again at the Clause, I must say that I should not wish to bind the local planning authority to any particular plan which it has submitted. It should be allowed to follow the most convenient course, whether of withdrawal or of alteration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One small point arises in connection with the reference by the right hon. and learned Member for Hertford-

shire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith) to the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"… and shall in that event be treated as never having been submitted."</p></blockquote>
I accept that a plan will have the force of law, and that very definite language must, therefore, be used in the statute, and I agree with the Minister that the Secretary of State should not be allowed to dictate to local planning authorities. However, I wish to avoid a situation in which one out of a number of authorities, by changing its mind, may put the plan to an 	<i>ab initio</i> stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that those words could create such a situation, so that the slow, ponderous and elaborate process of consultation and public participation necessary before a structure plan is even presented to the Minister will need to be repeated. The words are clear,
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall … be treated as never having been submitted".</p></blockquote>
If it has never been submitted, it is not in existence, and it is necessary to start all over again. That situation should not be allowed to arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Allason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the operative word here "submitted" not "made"?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman is correct. If that is the case, there would be no difficulty.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir D. Walker Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that necessarily correct? Section 8(1) of the 1971 Act reads:

The steps referred to in new Section 10B(3) are taken before submission, and there is not necessarily the conflict to which my hon. Friend referred.

	<section>
	<div class='title'>AMENDMENT OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO APPROVAL OF STRUCTURE PLANS AND LOCAL PLANS, ETC. BY SECRETARY OF STATE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 1, in page 5, line 10, insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"after consultation with the Lord Chancellor".</p></blockquote>
The Clause deals with the regulations which will be necessary for the approval of structure plans and local plans under the provisions amending them in the Bill. The effect of the Amendment to Section 9(4) of the 1971 Act is to associate the Lord Chancellor with the Secretary of State in respect of the regulations which are to govern that procedure to be followed and the examination in public of matters arising on the structure plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power of the Secretary of State to make regulations is in that subsection. It is not contemplated to make regulations at once. It would be far better if we were to start work on the public examinations under a code of practice rather than under regulations. That code of practice will clearly inform those taking part in public examinations about the aims of the new process and how it is intended to operate. It is a new process, and it would be better to experiment with it and to gain experience before finally laying down the procedure in regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code of practice will be evolved in consultation with local authority associations, with the Council on Tribunals and with the professional and amenity bodies concerned. The consultation paper suggesting the lines on which the code of practice might be shaped has been sent to all these bodies, and I have made it available in the Libraries of both Houses and in the Committee room. Members of the Committee can see what we have in mind, and the points on which we are consulting those concerned in the preparation of the code. Comments on that consultation paper are now arriving and are being carefully considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the new procedure has been tested in practice, it will be appropriate to consider the regulations which should be made for it. There are precedents for so doing. We have not drawn up regula-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
tions at once in the past when we have instituted some new form of inquiry. We see how it may work on a code of practice, and then, with the assistance of those concerned, consulting them again, we draw up the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say "we", and I think it entirely right that the Lord Chancellor should be associated with the process of formalising the procedure in a Statutory Instrument and with setting out the procedure itself. The drafting should not be left entirely to the Secretary of State. It is obviously proper that the Lord Chancellor should have a part in the drafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, that Statutory Instrument, which will include the regulations, may come before the House on the negative Resolution procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In connection with the word "consultation", perhaps I should mention that we had to consider whether these regulations should be made entirely by the Lord Chancellor, entirely by the Secretary of State, or with the concurrence of both. There are precedents for such regulations being made by both a Secretary of State and the Lord Chancellor, with all the formality of their being signed by both. To put it in perspective, one bears in mind that it is the Secretary of State, who is seeking to inform himself of the contents of the structure plans, who should draw up the procedure, but that he should do so in consultation with the legal mind of the Lord Chancellor. That is how it is drawn here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That should be a satisfactory way of doing it. There is, as I said, no intention of drawing up the regulations for the present. We want to gain experience of the procedure, and then, with the help of the Council on Tribunals, the local authority associations, and the professional and amenity bodies, we shall eventually draw up the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be grateful to the Minister for having told us what is in his mind on the code of practice and what it should contain. He was right to mention it at this stage, but it would be more appropriate to discuss it when we debate the Clause as a whole rather than immediately. I suggest that the first amenity society which the Minister required to help him should be this Committee, which has some experience of these matters. I know that he will be pleased to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
receive our suggestions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the Amendment, I should not advise my hon. Friends, or anybody else, to vote against it. Nevertheless, it seems rather odd. I should be more pleased had it provided for consultation with, or even the concurrence of, the right hon. and learned Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith). The right hon. and learned Gentleman's knowledge of the subject is inexhaustible, whereas the knowledge of the Lord Chancellor, for whom I have the greatest respect and affection, is rather more diffuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it surprising that at this stage, on the subject of regulations, one should suddenly add,
	<br><blockquote><p>"after consultation with the Lord Chancellor".</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Minister will be sufficiently well briefed to give me a dozen examples of "with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor", and perhaps seventeen examples of "after consultation with the Lord Chancellor". But I cannot remember any, and I cannot see the point of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the normal course of events, if Governments are run as they were when I played some little part in helping to run one, on the kind of regulations which the Minister has in mind one would certainly consult—and do rather more than consult—the Lord Chancellor, but one would do it in a normal, unofficial manner. Why write it into the Bill? The Bill is drafted extremely well—a good deal better than some Bills with which the Minister and I have had to deal. It reaches this late stage, and suddenly somebody says, "Good heavens! We have forgotten the Lord Chancellor".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it a little surprising. Had the Lord Chancellor said, "Wait a minute, I refuse to let you make regulations without my being able to say 'No'"—not totally inconsistent with the approach of the noble lord, the Lord Chancellor—that I would understand. But, apparently, all he said was, "I ought to be asked".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were the Secretary of State, I should say, "Of course I shall ask you; I shall do more; I shall put everything before you." But it is not necessary to amend a Bill to show that. I do not know what the right hon. and learned Member for Hertfordshire, East thinks, but if this is intended as a kind of sop to our pro fession to show that the matter will be handled in the proper way, I do not think that it will make any difference to us,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
because in the first place we assume that it is done in an improper way—as a profession that is the way our minds work—and we will finally be convinced only if after examining it we find there is merit in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment is totally unnecessary and a little Gilbertian. But in the happy spirit of the Committee—we are all after the same basic principle—if the Minister will be a happier man because no one divides against the Bill, why should I reduce his pleasure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir D. Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had it in mind to put one specific query to the Minister about the Clause, but, in view of the kind reference to myself by the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin), I shall say only a preliminary word. I know no more than he of the origin of the Amendment and its reference to consultation with the Lord Chancellor. It is not easy to imagine that the Lord Chancellor had been forgotten or overlooked in the earlier processes. There may, in the long and distinguished history of the Woolsack, have been occupants who could be ignored or overlooked, but the present Lord Chancellor does not spring immediately to mind as an example. No Goschen he who is likely to be forgotten by his colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that what happens is that somebody in the corridors of Westminster suddenly thinks, "We must be careful lest this version of the permissive society in the planning processes is allowed to go unbridled. Therefore, the watchful vigilance of the Lord Chancellor and his Department must be upon it." That is one explanation. Another is to keep the lawyers sweet, which is an occupation from which I should be the last to dissent. I see no particular virtue in the Amendment. On the other hand I see no great objection to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One small matter to which I should like to draw attention arises out of my hon. Friend's commendation of the Amendment. He referred to the deferment of the making of the regulations pending the production of the code of practice, which would provide an opportunity to see how it works out. I should like to know what would be the effect of such a deferment on subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>) Subsection (4) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may make regula-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
tions with respect to the procedure to be followed at any examination under subsection (3) of this section."</p></blockquote>
The code of practice will no doubt deal with that and the regulations in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>) the objections have to be considered
	<br><blockquote><p>"so far as they are made in accordance with regulations".</p></blockquote>
What will be the effect of that if there be no regulations? Is some unfortunate objector to be met with the point that his objections are not in order because they have not been made in accordance with a statutory requirement? He will retort that the law does not compel to the impossible, and there are all the makings of a controversy straightaway. I am sure that that is not the intention of the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a good deal in principle to be said for the deferment of the regulations because they will be better if they are drawn up on the basis of the code of practice. The Minister should consider whether that would have undesired effects—a sort of backlash—in respect of subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>) and the submission of objections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer to the point raised by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith) is that, there being no regulations, there would be no necessity to comply with anything. However, I agree that it is a point to be looked into. It clearly says "in accordance with regulations". If one put in brackets after those words "if in existence", I do not think that it would solve the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the objections to be made in a proper form in which they may be considered. The regulation-making power relating to objections is in Section 18 of the 1968 Act. In that there may be some solution. I shall certainly look at the point and I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend for raising it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir D. Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May we have the reference to that in the 1971 Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. A habit into which one falls when referring to previous Statutes is to forget that they have been consolidated. I still refer to the 1968 system of planning although it has been consolidated in the 1971 Act. Section 18

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
(1)(	<i>c</i>) of that Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Make provision with respect to the making and consideration of representations with respect to matters to be included in, or objections to, any such plan or proposals for alteration, repeal or replacement;"</p></blockquote>
That undoubtedly needs to be made clear in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speculation as to how the provision for consultation with the Lord Chancellor was included has entertained the Committee immensely. It is simple: I was happy to have in the Bill the provision that the Secretary of State should make the regulations relying upon the consultation between the Secretary of State and the Minister for Local Government and Development. That did not need to be expressed in the Bill. When the Council on Tribunals read the Bill's proposals, it drew attention to the need for the Lord Chancellor to be mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that we had not forgotten the Lord Chancellor, and he would naturally have been consulted, but the noble Lady, the Chairman of the Council on Tribunals, is quite irresistible. When she required the Lord Chancellor to be mentioned in the Bill, I saw no reason why that should not be done. That is the history of the matter, and that is why mention is made in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"but shall in any event be required to publish a list of such matters affecting his consideration of the plan as he considers ought to be examined at least 28 days before such examination is held".</p></blockquote>
Briefly, the procedure laid down is that where the Secretary of State is determined not to reject a plan, before determining whether to approve it he must consider any objections to it. He must then
	<br><blockquote><p>"cause a person or persons appointed by him for the purpose to hold an examination in public".</p></blockquote>
of matters which he thinks ought to be examined. There are also the regulations, which initially will not come into force, as the Minister has told us, but which will be preceded by a code of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
If I had known about the code of practice, I might have left this point for discussion during the "Clause stand part" debate. But I did not know about it and so I put down the Amendment. I did not necessarily put forward the Amendment in the belief that it was a good thing to give the Secretary of State power to make regulations—with or without powers to consult the Lord Chancellor. The Secretary of State is thereby fettered in the making of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wanted to draw attention to a point which I believe to be important. All of us who practise in the legal profession in one form or another accept that there is a vital need for speed. That is why we welcome the Bill and why we are speeding it on its way. But, whether or not engaged in legal practice, I believe that all members of the Committee accept and expect that there shall be the fullest degree of participation. I refer not only to the making of objections, but the positive fact of participating in the plan so that it may be improved by those who have the knowledge and ought to be encouraged to give their advice and wisdom in the making of a plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that one has to take a narrow path between those two objectives. There are many illustrations wherein weighting it on the side of participation may take away from the speed so much that it might be better not to introduce the idea. The Minister gave an effective example when he talked about the Town & Country Planning Association. The Association wanted as it were a two-stage basis where the proposal was for one stage in which alternative schemes were put forward and the matter became solid at a second stage, rather than all in one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic towards my proposal, although he may disagree with the way in which I have put it, or with the actual mechanics. If he could give general encouragement about the general principle, that would satisfy me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is necessary that people should be given the opportunity of knowing what are the matters which the Secretary of State has decided are relevant and should be considered. While I accept that the regulations ought to contain such a list, and while I accept that the code of practice may contain such a list, the reason I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
have put down the Amendment, which fetters the Secretary of State to some extent, is that I believe that there ought to be a time limit in which the Secretary of State should be forced to publish the list so that people may consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one stage, I discussed with my hon. Friends what might be an appropriate time. My first reaction was that it ought to be longer than 28 days, but my hon. Friends pointed out that that might be taking the balance too far the other way. On the other hand, to say seven or 14 days would be nugatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have therefore suggested 28 days, a time which, as a law practitioner, I come across in so many legal practices. I am not wedded to it. But I have explained what was in my mind in the Amendment and I hope that the Minister, who was previously a practitioner in the law, and who, I hope, will be again in the not-too-distant future, will appreciate it as being worthy of consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment would require the Secretary of State to give 28 days' notice of the issues which he considers should be discussed at the examination in public of the structure plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The setting of a period of this sort must come eventually, but I suggest that it would not be correct at this stage to put it in the Bill. It would come, I believe, in regulations. In the consultation document, no particular time was mentioned. I refer to paragraph 20 dealing with selection of issues for examination in public:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The list of issues to be examined and the list of invited participants would be made available, with an indication of the expected timing of the examination."</p></blockquote>
That might mean that they were made available only the day before the examination. That is not the intention. I had the intention of indicating that there would be pre-knowledge, at a reasonable time, of the issues and participants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Points could be raised about this with the Secretary of State. That is another matter which should be considered carefully in the code of practice. Someone might object that an issue had been omitted, or that he as a participant should be included in the list. Should that objection be made to the Chairman of the panel and the chairman advise the Secretary of State, or should it be made direct to the Secretary of State? Those are matters which have been put forward
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
in the consultation paper and on which we must decide in the code of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the list is set out, after the Secretary of State has indicated his views about the issues and the participants, there should be an opportunity for representations concerning that list. I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman that there should be a period of time, be it 28 days, a fortnight, or six weeks. These are periods that he and I know well in planning law. This remains to be considered as we get the replies to the consultation document. I hope that we can leave it indefinite so far as the Bill is concerned without writing part of the regulations or part of the code into the Bill, as the right hon. Gentleman seeks to do. I am entirely with him in wanting a time between the publication of the list of issues and participants, as the Secretary of State sees them, and the actual examination so that points may be raised on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to build in a period of delay or obstruction. We want to get on with this as quickly as possible, remembering that much depends in future on the structure plans and publication of the final plans to the public. We do not want any period of delay. We want a short period in which full consideration may be given to the issues which are to be heard in that examination in public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This may strike you at first, Sir Stephen, as out of order, but I assure you that it is not—I rarely stray out of order. It is relevant to my view of what ought to happen to the Amendment. Would the Minister tell the Committee at this stage what sort of timing he has in mind for the code of practice? I do not expect that the Bill will be subject eventually to a timetable motion; I assume that it will go through the House speedily and with good effect and it has already been through another place. Therefore, the probability is that it will receive the Royal Assent in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once it has received the Royal Assent, it becomes one of the laws of the country. If it has no regulations, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith) pointed out, this has certain effects. If, in addition, it has no code of practice, this may have other effects, too. I agree absolutely that he ought to consult widely about the terms of that code
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were to be a long delay between the Royal Assent and the code of practice, let alone the regulations, I might be encouraged to do what I do not really want to do—to ask the Committee to accept the Amendment simply because it would be at least one factor that would be binding on the Secretary of State and that he would have to take into account. When I started speaking, I had no intention of fettering the Secretary of State. Had I realised that the code of practice was coming along, I should have made it a "Clause stand part" point rather than a separate Amendment. But if we have to wait six months for a code of practice, this is the most important contribution that we as a Committee could make to the balance between the speed at which we want the procedure to develop and the public participation which we regard as being important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are introducing by Clause 3 a new Section into the 1971 Act. In the 1971 Act there are provisions for bringing parts of that Act into operation by commencement order. One may bring in little bits of it at any period of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No mention of commencement orders relating to this sort of thing is to be found in the Bill because the commencement order provisions in the 1971 Act will apply. Therefore, we can bring any parts of this provision into operation when we are ready to do so. I assure the Committee that I shall not authorise any items relating to the examination in public to be brought into operation until we have the code ready to apply to the examination in public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I frankly tell the Committee, without receiving official advice—no doubt putting great difficulty on my officials by saying this—that I am sure that the officials will do all that they can to see that my assurance is carried out to the letter without delaying the operation of the Bill. I do not want to delay the operation. But, as the right hon. Gentleman said, it is essential that we have this code before we start operating these examinations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir D. Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, my hon. Friend has said that the code of practice will come into being on some date that he cannot yet identify, but that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
the coming into operation of the relevant part of the Bill will be governed by that date, whenever it may be. That seems to be a satisfactory position. I agree both with the suggestion of the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) that there should be a requirement as to a list and also with the Minister that, subject to what he has just said, it would not be necessary to write it into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one short comment about the timing. The right hon. Gentleman said that there was room for more than one view as to whether 28 days was right, while fully taking into account the importance of not expending any unnecessary time on these matters, particularly having regard to the fact that the principal object of the new procedure is to get rid of the time consuming periods. Nevertheless, I hope that the 28 days is a minimum period, and it may have to be more when one considers the background to this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be concerned with participants. Participants, by their nature, are groups and assemblies of people, societies and representatives, who require more time for the processes of consultation and dissemination and absorption than would single property owners in the category of objectors. The other consideration is that in these provisions there is no close season in the 28 days as there is in the Rules of the Supreme Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we flatter ourselves in this country that we do not have many public holidays, it is remarkable that whenever any kind of time limit for this kind of procedure is relevant, Christmas, or Easter, or the August holiday, nearly always prevents people from undertaking the necessary consultations, instructions and advice. Thus, I hope that the 28 days would be a minimum. In practice, I think that it will necessarily be rather longer, although not such as to prejudice the objects of the Bill in saving time and preventing delay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend, the Minister, and the right hon. and learned Gentleman have concentrated on the timing aspect of the Amendment. I would point out that two points are raised in the Amendment, one dealing with the question of 28 days, the other dealing specifically with publication. It seeks to make available not merely to a selected
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0467">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
list of participants but to the public at large those issues to which the Secretary of State will be directing his mind at the public inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to whether this should be included in the regulations or the Bill; I always think that, for a provision of this kind, dealing with the public, it is always best to put it in the Bill, rather than in regulations. Although planning law is very much the province of the habitues in these matters who would know the regulations, a Bill is more easily obtainable by the public, by practitioners, or by solicitors who are not normally practitioners in planning but who may be called upon to advise an interested group in the area. However, it is often difficult to obtain the regulations under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, while the Committee has some say about the contents of the Bill, it has little or no say about the regulations. Paragraph 20 of the code of practice states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The list of issues to be examined and the list of invited participants would be made available, with an indication of the expected timing of the examination."</p></blockquote>
The difficulty which arises is that until an examination is actually taking place, the public at large, not constituting a pressure group, is unaware of the major issues to be considered. Paragraph 12 (	<i>d</i>) of the code, for example, furnishes examples of issues upon which the public should be informed by publication. It is stated that the Secretary of State may single out for attention at the inquiry
	<br><blockquote><p>"any major features which have clear implications for areas outside that covered by the plan, e.g. ports, airfields, major industrial development …".</p></blockquote>
Those are precisely the sensitive issues—particularly ports and airports—where those living in and around the areas involved would need to have knowledge of the discussions to be undertaken at the inquiry. Opportunity would thereby be provided for them, even at that stage, to form the necessary amenity group, possibly engaging a solicitor or planner to present their case to the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will know of one such example which affected his own constituency—the little local difficulty which arose in connection with the docks at Crosby. In such cases, people often wake up to the event long after the issue has been raised within our charmed circles. Very often, too, such cases are of little
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
interest to the Press. Thus, ordinary people might suddenly discover that, as they did not constitute an amenity group, they had not been notified of or invited to the inquiry, although others—possibly the projectors of the scheme in question, with their greater expertise, resources and skill in approaching the Minister—had been present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, in addition to the question of timing, my hon. Friends and I are anxious that publication shall take place, so that the public may be aware of the issues involved at the inquiry, rather than the select few whom the Minister, or Secretary of State may choose. He may not do so intentionally. He may simply not be aware of the existence of other interested parties. Publication will enable them to form an amenity group in order to apply to the Secretary of State to make either written or oral representations at the inquiry concerning the effect which the projected development will have upon their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is what planning is about. There must be far more public participation in planning decisions which, when taken, affect people's lives and environment for many years to come. The Amendment seeks to establish in the Bill, beyond peradventure, the duty of the Secretary of State to publish the list of issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the right hon. and learned Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith) that 28 days seems to be a short time for an organisation to present its views, to provide itself with the necessary funds for professional advice, to consult a solicitor and for the latter to brief counsel, for planning experts to be consulted. However, at least it is a fixed time. Personally, I wish to stress the publication aspect of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) has depressed me profoundly, for it would appear from his remarks that those of us who served on the Town and Country Planning Bill, 1968, failed on the matter of publication, as well as the other matter with which we dealt earlier this morning. I should hate to think that that situation had occurred. It is my recollection that we spent an immense amount of time ensuring publication at all stages of a structure plan. Certainly, Section 18 (	<i>b</i>) of the Town and Country Planning Act implies that the regulations shall cover publicity. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend can
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
assure me that the matter is adequately covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring particularly to the document which the Minister has circulated and in which there is no mention of publication with regard to the selection of issues for examination in public. It is stated that it must be available to the list of invited participants. That is not publication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a publication of the list of issues and of participants. The consultation document does not specifically state that the list is published only to the participants, the chosen few who will appear at the inquiry. In fact, that would make nonsense of the list. No doubt there will be many people who will have requested to be heard, and who will have made the old type of objection, which is not the criterion for appearance on a committee or an examination of this kind. It is the issues embodied in the structure plan which have to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To establish the correct background all these matters will have been considered, and will be publicly known to a great extent by virtue of the public participation which will have taken place up to the point under discussion which, after all, represents a very advanced stage in the preparation of the structure plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will have been public participation in the report of the survey, and the announcement to the public of what the local planning authority intends to put in the plan. One hopes that all these points will have been discussed by all interested parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The plan is then submitted to the Secretary of State, who will then consider, with those who appear from previous participation to be interested, what the issue should be, and who should participate in the public examination. The Department's consultation document provides a detailed outline of the proposed procedures for the examination. Paragraph 20 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The list of issues to be examined … would be made available, with an indication of the expected timing of the examination."</p></blockquote>
The same paragraph also mentions the necessity for a time to be stated in the code of practice, and thereby eventually carried forward into regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference is also made in the consultation document to the need for an opportunity for proposals to be made within a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
stated period for amending or adding to the list of issues, and for representations to this effect to be considered before the final list is drawn up. The final list would be published in good time as the basic terms of reference for the examination. There is no question of its being kept from the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have indicated in that consultation document goes far beyond what is stated in the Amendment. The Amendment seeks to put into statutory form one single stage of the whole of the procedures associated with the examination of the issue. It seems more sensible—I hope the General Committee will agree—to leave all those procedures to be set out in the code of practice, and eventually in the regulations. That code and the regulations will be subject to full consultation and will be changed and adapted in the light of experience on the first few structure plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestions made in the consultation documents go further—I say it again—than the Amendment. They provide not only for the publication of a list, but also for ways of amending and adding to that list. It would give the wrong indication of priorities if we selected only a part of the code and a part of the eventual regulations for insertion in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as I gathered from the tone of the speech of the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), he still contemplates having the Amendment inserted in the Bill, instead of his right hon. Friend accepting my assurances and seeking leave to withdraw it, let me use the final scraping of the barrel—a drafting point. If it were to be inserted in the Bill, this is not the right place. Subsection (4) to which he has added it deals with:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… regulations with respect to the procedure to be followed at "—</p></blockquote>
and I underline that at—
	<br><blockquote><p>"any examination …".</p></blockquote>
not prior to the examination, or leading up to it. If this were to be added, it would need a separate paragraph, because it deals with something leading up to the examination, and not the regulations for the conduct of the examination itself. I dislike using drafting arguments, but this is the wrong place in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will feel that the code is the right place. I give my assurance that it will be in the code, and that the list of issues and participants will be made known to those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0469">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
whom the Secretary of State knows may be interested, and will also be published in some form to make it known to the public. There will be time between the publication of that list and the hearing of the examination—time which will be appropriate for points to be raised and representations made to the Secretary of State on that list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir D. Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister take it one step further in regard to the method of dissemination? There are two phrases here, both imprecise, "would be made available" in paragraph 20, and "publish" in the Amendment. Neither taken by itself defines the mechanics and procedure—advertisement in the local Press or whatever. Something is required to meet the point of the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) about bringing the matter to the attention of a wider public than the participants, not least those who might wish to participate if they were fully aware of the issues involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may be more precise in my assurance. The Secretary of State should see that the fact that he has made a list of issues and participants is advertised and made known publicly. That list might be rather elaborate. It might not be proper to advertise that, taking up several columns of the local newspaper, and the advertisement might say where the particulars were available. It may be that on further consideration it would be thought proper to advertise the whole list, but I cannot give an assurance on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give the assurance that the fact that the Secretary of State has come to a decision, and where the decision may be available for inspection, will be advertised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may express pride of authorship, this is one of the few Amendments where I have drafted something myself, saying that this is the principle, and asking somebody to translate. The old adage that the solicitor who acts for himself has a fool for a client may be used against me. I do not think that it is entirely the wrong place, but I shall not make a point of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a great deal of merit in what my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) said. Had I been aware of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
the consultation document and the code of practice, I should have made my point during the "Clause stand part" debate, rather than putting down an Amendment. However, thinking it out, and in view of our discussion, I am pleased to have put the Amendment down, since we have had a long, interesting and informative discussion. On a rough calculation, if nothing else the country is indebted for about 1,200 guineas' worth of advice given free, and it cannot be the loser for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the refreshers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We hope there will be none. We should be able to dispense with this subject soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points that have been made should be useful to the Minister and the Department. They show the anxieties that require to be met. I said earlier that I thought the Bill well drafted. It is. If that is the hand of Jacob, perhaps the consultation document is the hand of Esau—hairy, no doubt, and worthy, no doubt, but not in the strict line of succession. Perhaps that is why it is more ambiguous than the Bill, but one does not expect it to be anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend made a good point, which needed to be stated. It is underlined by the fact that regulations are unamendable. The House may decide not to have them; the House may agree to them; but the House may not amend them. This is the procedure which the Minister, from a previous existence, well knows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the code of practice may be amended, though not necessarily by the House. It may be amended as we go along until the regulations are ready. Certain things may be inserted in the code of practice as experience teaches us that it ought to be amended. Whatever the history of the code of practice, however long it goes on, it must be absolutely crystal clear. I accept that the language in the consultation document does not necessarily have to be crystal clear, because we have the Minister here to explain it to us, but when that code of practice is actually promulgated, it must be so clear that not only practitioners, but the lay public will be able to understand, to make sense of it, and to contribute—as we would all wish—in making a better plan for the area in which they live or with which they are associated.

Having listened to 1,200 guineas' worth of advice over the past few minutes, I almost feel reluctant to give my opinion as a former chairman of a planning committee of an urban district with some delegated powers from a county council. I have been at the receiving end of some town planning legislation and I have no doubt that, along with other hon. Members on Saturday morning, I shall be hearing from other people who are at the receiving end. I am one of those who looks forward to seeing codes of conduct, and indeed Bills, which may be intelligible to the non-lawyer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have welcomed the Bill, and I appreciate that it is an attempt to streamline procedures, to get not only objections but public discussion of the merits and demerits of structure and local plans. Having looked at the consultation document, I am still apprehensive about the extension of the powers of the Secretary of State and the removal of some of his obligations. Although I suggested the Amendment as soon as I had taken a long look at the Bill, in February, I believe that this is an apprehension shared by some planning officers and by some jurists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill provides for two things:
	<ol>
	<li>The removal of the obligation placed on the Secretary of State should provide an objector to a structure plan with an opportunity to be heard; and</li>
	<li>The substitution of a duty on the Secretary of State to arrange for an examination, in public, of issues raised by the structure plan."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
In place of those two factors, we now have one, that the Secretary of State shall cause a person appointed by him for the purpose to hold an examination in public of such matters affecting this consideration of the plan as he considers ought to be examined. The Secretary of State will decide what is to be examined at the public examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5), with which my Amendment deals, removes the obligation of the Secretary of State to secure to any local planning authority or other person a right to be heard at any examination. So the Secretary of State will decide what will be discussed at the examination and who will take part in the discussion. Unless there are more adequate safeguards than appear in the Bill, this is not satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the Minister's problem. If there is a full examination in public of all the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
objections, with all objectors and supporters taking part in that examination, we shall be a long time getting our structure plan. It may cause blight and uncertainty, because it will delay the start of preparation of local plans. No doubt, the problems in the greater London inquiry have affected the Minister's thinking on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Amendment is to define more clearly the obligation of the Secretary of State to show that an objection is either not concerned with the structure plan, or is being dealt with as part of another objection. That is a more reasonable safeguard than that in the Bill or that in the consultation document, paragraph 11 of which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The intention is to make a clean break from the past. The Secretary of State will still be required to consider objections. But in addition, and as a separate part of the process of determining whether to approve the plan he will have the clear opportunity to probe, in public, those aspects of a local planning authority's strategy which have either proved controversial during the process of public participation preceding submission, or appear to the Secretary of State, on his closer examination of the submitted plan, to raise doubts which should be examined."</p></blockquote>
From that paragraph, I think what we want to get is a conference, not the usual examination of objections to plans. It is important that at such a conference there should be a voice for the organisation or individual whose observations are different from the others. There may be doubt as to whether his objection is concerned with the structure plan or the plans to follow. One of the problems that will arise is that people who object to local plans may well be told, "That was settled by the structure plan and you are too late".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With my Amendment, the Secretary of State would say to the objector, "I have considered your written objection to the structure plan. You will be interested to know that an amenity society or an angling club"—I have more angling clubs than amenity societies in my area—"is interested in certain aspects of the plans being made." He might say, "You are raising a similar point. Perhaps you can get together for joint representation at the examination." He might say, "I have noted your objection to the structure plan, but I feel that the main argument will arise when the local plan is examined, and that would be the best time to bring these points forward for public discussion."
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
I realise that the public examination is only one stage in what should be a series of stages involving public participation, in preparing, surveying, considering and finally approving a structure plan. I have noted the large number of points considered by the Skeffington Committee on structure plans, including—
	<br><blockquote><p>"people should be kept informed.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Publicity should be directed in such a way as will inform the public of proposals.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The local planning authority should establish and maintain a central register of persons who wish to be informed when proposals are published."</p></blockquote>
and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be disastrous if, after all the attempts that will be made to provide information and try to ensure public participation—it is a difficult task to wake people up at this stage to what is going on—and people take part, putting forward their ideas and forming themselves into groups, at the vital stage of the public examination they are told, "You will not be heard". If they are left with the impression that Whitehall knows best, or Marsham Street knows best in this case, that the whole procedure will suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been made clear by the Government that the Council on Tribunals will have oversight of the new procedure. But to most people, even to most hon. Members, the Council on Tribunals is a more remote body than the Secretary of State for the Environment and his Department. In view of the feeling that may arise unless we put in the safeguard suggested, I urge the Committee to support the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Marks). Like him, I am not a barrister or a solicitor, and I ask for the greatest latitude and tolerance from the lawyers among us in the criticisms which they may justifiably make of my Amendments Nos. 5 and 6. The purpose of Clause 3, which my Amendments would soften, is to take away important rights from an individual. That is one of the reasons why we should examine closely why the Government want Clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are trying to prevent undue delay in the implementation of planning inquiries. I agree with that. I believe that the Government could cite what happened on the greater London development plan in support of Clause 3,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
but I do not have sufficient knowledge to comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, when one is discussing a local planning authority's structure plan in public, one should as far as possible try to confine the discussion to the broad principles rather than go into the detail of it. The latter can best be left for discussion on the local plan or when a planning application is put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Third, there is the vexed problem of planning blight, which causes concern and offence to many people affected under the old development plans and, now, the new structure plans. In so far as planning blight can be prevented, it will be useful to settle the details of a structure plan and local plan as quickly as possible, so that people may know where they stand. Anything that discourages delay or prolonging the time taken over the structure plan would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments against the Government's proposal in Clause 3 have been put well by the hon. Member for Gorton. In brief, Clause 3 proposes to narrow the catchment area from which objections can be present and to limit the number of objectors. With respect to my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and Development, I do not think that it is a satisfactory defence to say that all concerned would have the right to make representations because they could make written representations. I shall not argue the point now, but there is a fundamental difference between submitting a written representation or objection and being allowed to speak and make one's case personally, at a public examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The structure plan cannot necessarily be fully examined and openly scrutinised at an examination in public if Clause 3 is retained in its present form. Hon. Members will have received representations from many organisations. I have received representations from the National Farmers' Union, Justice and the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. I quote one paragraph from a letter written by the parliamentary secretary of the National Farmers' Union—not a hitherto unnoticed member of the Government, I hasten to say, in spite of his title—
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is, therefore, vital to the agricultural
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
industry that there should be the maximum opportunity to influence the structure plans and an adequate opportunity for meaningful agricultural objection. This means that there needs to be an adequate opportunity for probing, challenging and examining in depth local authority plans. Providing that the new examination in public would allow for this as effectively as a Public Inquiry does, we would not object to it. All we are anxious to achieve is a firm assurance by Government that where-ever agriculture is a factor in structure plans, there will be an opportunity for its representatives to probe, challenge and cross-examine meaningfully."</p></blockquote>
Agriculture is vital to our country. I believe that it is the largest single industry. I should not, however, confine the purport of those remarks to farmers. It applies equally to any individual affected in any way by the proposals in a structure plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it stands, Clause 3 is not satisfactory, and I should like to give one or two other reasons on which the hon. Member for Gorton did not touch. How often in our lives we think that a point is not controversial and yet it suddenly becomes so. By the same token, how often something we expect to be controversial turns out not to be. It happens in Committee. Sometimes, something is said either on the Floor of the House or in Committee which sparks off a new train of thought and captures the imagination of hon. Members. There is fear that this might happen if Clause 3 is accepted as it stands. This is why I have a great deal of sympathy with Amendment No. 3 proposed by the hon. Member. We expect a matter not to be controversial, and because of something arising later it suddenly becomes so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, as Clause 3 now stands, it puts the Secretary of State in an invidious position. For example, he might have to decide whether to give the right to one amenity association to appear at a public examination of a structure plan but not to another. This seems to put him in an invidious position and not to give a fair opportunity to amenity societies generally, whether it be the Civic Trust, a civic society or an anglers' club. In one area there may be many amenity societies and the Secretary of State may feel that he can not call them all. How does he differentiate between the merits and the claims of one individual and another? It may cause him some difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, recognising the merits of Clause 3 and the very valid objections which have been made to it, we must try
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
to streamline the methods of dealing with structure plans without overriding the rights of individuals, of communities generally and, indeed, of local planning authorities and local authorities, because they can be debarred from appearing to make representations at an examination of a structure plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not support Amendment No. 3, as I think that there is a need to streamline the process. I have an open mind on Amendment No. 4. Obviously, I should like to invite the Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should oppose Amendment No. 3 by itself, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Somewhat naturally, I ask the Minister and the Committee to support Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 in my name, as being a sensible compromise and an attempt to fuse the valid arguments put forward on the other side of the Committee and those which I have expressed this morning. We must try, on the one hand, to be efficient and, on the other, to be absolutely fair to everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 5 would give to the person, or persons, appointed by the Secretary of State to conduct the examination in public of a structure plan the right to use his discretion to call other people, notwithstanding whom the Secretary of State decides shall appear to give oral evidence and make oral statements—and any other local authority or local planning authority not so invited by the Secretary of State. In other words he may use his discretion at any time before or during the examination in public to cover the point that it may be convenient to have evidence on other matters arising from evidence given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 6 is complementary. As the examination in public proceeds the person, or persons, appointed by the Secretary of State should be able to allow other matters, not previously allowed by the Secretary of State, to be discussed, if he feels they are relevant to the discussion. I could certainly cite instances where I believe that this would be a good idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir D. Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is putting an interesting and stimulating argument. Has he, in this context, considered paragraph 28 of the consultation document, which seems to envisage, presumably by incorporation, in the code of practice, very much what his proposed sub section has in mind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend. I must say, "No, I had not". I apologise for that. I only received the consultation document this morning, and the Amendment was put down some days ago. I answer his inference by saying that I still think that it should be included in the Bill. I do not apologise for Amendments Nos. 5 and 6. However irrelevant they may have become because of the consultation document, there is still need for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to raise one other point directly in relation to this aspect. Resentment against decisions by local planning authorities on planning applications is so often caused by the fact that the public has no idea that the application has been made. For this reason, I strongly support the Skeffington Report, and the attempts by both Governments in the last few years to try to make the planning process more open. Therefore, we must be very careful before we restrict anyone's right to make his views known, particularly on such a fundamental matter as a structure plan. I believe that, as it stands, Clause 3 is out of sympathy with what we are trying to create in planning in the 1970s. I submit that Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 might help to remedy this position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Mr. Chapman) was unduly modest. As the representative of the highest paid profession among those represented here, he can be assured that we are delighted to hear his views. He put them moderately and effectively. At this stage, I should like to explain the difference between the two sets of Amendments, and to clear up one point worrying the hon. Gentleman with which my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Marks) with his sense of humour, did not deal fully. The point about the "not" in Amendment 3 is that it paves the way to Amendment No. 4 and must be read in conjunction with it. Merely to concern himself with a flat negative—knowing my hon. Friend as well as I do, I am certain of this—is something he would never dream of doing in his wildest moments. If one then reads the whole subsection as one, one can see that the deletion of "not" is necessary to make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the force of the hon. Gentleman's Amendments. I have a lot of sympathy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
We are talking about the same principle, differing only on the means of achieving it. If I understood the hon. Gentleman correctly, he felt that my hon. Friend's Amendment was somewhat wider in effect than his two Amendments, which rather narrowed the point. While giving the same amount of participation in principle as my hon. Friend's Amendment, the hon. Gentleman's Amendments did not go quite as far, as rigorously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having looked at them all, I reached a reverse point of view. If anything, my hon. Friend's Amendments are narrower in effect than the hon. Gentleman's Amendments No. 5 and Amendment No. 6. I could well be wrong, but as I understand it, my hon. Friend's point is directed not to the panel but to the Secretary of State. I suppose it is for argument whether the Secretary of State can delegate the power later or not. Perhaps he can. I do not know. However, he must ensure that all objections are heard unless, in his opinion, those objections do not relate to the structure plan, or the points at issue have been or would have been dealt with in the hearing of another objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is not to be empowered to limit any objection to the structure plan itself, if that is the proper place for the objection. If, for example, it is to be the local plan, that would not be so. The objection might be heard at another hearing—which could be on the local plan, or on another structure plan—or it might already have been dealt with. That is the basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understood the hon. Gentleman's Amendments, when the hearing comes along, the panel decides whether something is relevant. It does not even have to decide that it is relevant; it could be irrelevant. The panel has merely to decide, at its own discretion, that it wants to hear further objections, whether those objections are relevant, or whether they are related to the structure plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difference between the two approaches—an important difference. Suppose that the Secretary of State has decided that one of the issues to be considered is whether the area of Blackacre is suitable for residential zoning as such. In the normal course of events, under my hon. Friend's Amendment considerations of density would be irrelevant. If I read the hon. Gentleman's Amendment cor-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
rectly—I am not being pedantic—it would be possible for the panel to say that, although it is a local plan matter, not a structure plan matter, the panel would like to hear evidence on density, and would be capable of doing so. If it did, we would again find ourselves on the slippery slope of time—which is why I am worried by the hon. Gentleman's Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had my hon. Friend not put down his Amendments, I should have supported those of the hon. Gentleman rather than the existing situation, because I agree that participation is what matters. However, because my hon. Friend's Amendments are narrower, they make more practical sense than those of the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir D. Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the right hon. Gentleman considered the further alternative—if, grammatically, one can have a further alternative—in paragraph 28, which gives a discretion, but limits the discretion in a way which my hon. Friend's Amendment does not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman. I was coming to that point. The Committee will be grateful to him for having raised it. It is another kind of discretion, not on all fours with the hon. Gentleman's Amendments, and still less on all fours with those of my hon. Friend. Again this may be because Esau has drafted it, and not Jacob.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here it is said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Panel chairman should presumably have wide powers of discretion"—</p></blockquote>
but we are not actually told that he has wide powers of discretion: there is a presumption that he has:
	<br><blockquote><p>"but would operate within broad procedures laid down in a contemplated code of practice."</p></blockquote>
That is fine:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He …would have a final discretion to admit, on behalf of the Secretary of State, further issues"—</p></blockquote>
and here is the nub;
	<br><blockquote><p>"on grounds which could not previously have been foreseen."</p></blockquote>
What is in common between the Amendments of the hon. Gentleman and those of my hon. Friend, and what both hon. Gentlemen strongly feel, is that they are dealing with matters which should, or could have, or ought to have, been foreseen, or were foreseen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may be able to clear it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
up—it may be a rather ambiguous amateur drafting—but I read it to mean that on the day that the examination takes place, or a day or two earlier, if some issue has suddenly blown up which the Secretary of State could not have put in his list, and it is something that the panel chairman might decide to consider for that reason, following on that he will admit other people to appear at the hearing who would not have been able to appear had that issue not come up. Paragraph 28 introduces a limiting factor, which does not add much. The right hon. and learned Gentleman might merely have wanted us to comment on it, and I have not the slightest doubt that he will comment on it himself later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paragraph adds nothing to participation. It merely says that if another issue blows up that nobody could possibly have foreseen it seems sensible to have those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
who know something about it appearing at that examination. That does not give us anything. It would be extraordinary to have a further, new issue brought up on which those concerned did not appear. It differs both in spirit and in effect from the Amendments of my hon. Friend and those of the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried—I hope fairly—to point out the differences between the two sets of Amendments and paragraph 28 of the consultation document, and I now come to the merits. Once again we have the terrible dilemma—which I fully appreciate—of time on the one hand and participation on the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
