	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed.</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"That during the proceedings on the National Insurance Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock."—[	<i>Mr. Dean.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Barbara Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall not object to the Motion. It will enable us to make steady and satisfactory progress. I am feeling a little left-handed at the moment because the last time I was in this Room I was on the other side, and I assure you, Sir Stephen, that if the Government behave on this occasion as we did on the last occasion, and we in the Opposition do not behave as the then Opposition did, we should be able to make progress. Certainly there will not be any filibustering or deliberate time wasting on our part although there are a large number of detailed and important points in the Bill which we feel it our duty to examine thoroughly and carefully. We shall have to see how we go along. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the Second Reading debate in the House did not give opportunity for the detailed exploration which we need to carry out on this quite complicated little Bill. It may be that this Motion will be enough. We shall have to see how we go along.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Stephen. I fully understand that we cannot question the selection of Amendments and I am not generally seeking to do so, but could you give advice to us on Amendment No. 1, which has not been selected? Was it out of order either because it was against the Long Title or because there is the possibility of its principle being accepted in the form of a new Clause or later Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Member will look further down the Notice Paper he will find that it is resurrected in a new form, as new Clause 1. The hon. Member need have no fears on that score.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Stephen. Is it possible for you to give us any further indication in view of the rearrangement of the Amendments and the putting down of Amendments in amended form? Are they in order in the new form?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New Clause 1 is in order. The original Amendment was out of order. It was outside the scope of Clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Mr, Paul Dean)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That consideration of Clauses 2 to 8, new Clauses and Schedules 2 to 6 be postponed till after the consideration of Schedule 1."</p></blockquote>
This is partly to meet a request from the Opposition. Schedule 1 is the main Schedule dealing with the rates of benefit and therefore follows naturally from Clause 1. I agree that this would be for the convenience of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for the assurance she has given that she has no intention to filibuster the Bill. I am sure that both sides of the Committee wish to get the Bill, after proper discussion, on to the Statute Book as quickly as possible, so that the large amount of administrative work which has to be done between now and the beginning of October to get these new rates of benefit and contributions into operation can be done in due time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his courtesy in meeting my representations to him in this way. He has appreciated that the guts of the Bill are in Clause 1 as given meaning by Schedule 1. Therefore it would have been an odd situation if we had not been able to take Schedule 1 with Clause 1. I appreciate his help in this matter. We welcome it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved</i>,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That consideration of Clauses 2 to 8, new Clauses and Schedules 2 to 6 be postponed till after the consideration of Schedule 1."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that there is a Financial Resolution in connection with this Bill. Copies are available in the Room. I also call attention to the fact that adequate notice should be given of Amendments. As a general rule, I do not propose to call manuscript Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 45, leave out from beginning to end of line 19 on page 3 and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 of this Act."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be convenient to consider at the same time Amendment No. 10, also standing in the name of the right hon. Lady and the names of her hon. Friends, in Schedule 1, page 11, column 2, leave out lines 16 to 21 and insert "£1.15".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you rightly suggest, Sir Stephen, Amendment No. 2, which may look a little obscure on its own, is given meaning by Amendment No. 10. Taking the two together, the purpose is shown to be simple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By Amendment No. 2 we seek to remove the present trinity of rates for the invalidity allowance. It may seem a little odd that we should seek to do this till we turn to Amendment No. 10, where we see that the consequence of Amendment No. 2 would be to substitute, for the age of onset of the trio of allowances, one blanket allowance at the higher rate for all those who are entitled to the invalidity allowance. The purpose is simple. It is to get rid of the difference in financial terms for those qualifying for the invalidity allowance. It is, therefore, designed to put on the same basis all those who have been found, because of chronic sickness or disability, to be entitled to an invalidity allowance in terms of their needs for additional allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill makes a modest increase in the size of the invalidity allowance. Heaven knows, it is a modest one. The hon. Gentleman has on many occasions said that the invalidity allowance scheme is a very modest start, and he will be the first to appreciate that this adjustment in the already modest allowance is more modest still. The position under the Government's proposal is that those under the age of 35 at the time of onset shall get an additional 15p on the higher rate, thus bringing the higher rate to £1.15. Those over 35 and under 45 at the time of onset are to get an additional 10p
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
on the middle rate of 60p, bringing it to the magnificent sum of 70p. Those over 45 and under 60, if men, or 55, if women, are to get 5p on the lower rate of 30p, bringing them to the bonanza sum of 35p. The increase in the higher rate is not exactly lavish—15p does not go very far these days—and having recognised the existence of the need here we can hardly claim that we are discharging our responsibilities over-lavishly by achieving £1.15 on the higher rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make it clear at the onset that even with the increase we think that the higher rate is inadequate. We would like it to have been far more within the sort of range which the Disablement Income Group has been talking about, but, as I have said, we shall not in this Committee be making debating points or unrealistic demands for purely propaganda purposes. So we have put forward these two Amendments as a modest proposition. We are concentrating on principle rather than on rates, attempting to get rid of an invidious distinction in the needs of the chronic sick—a distinction on ground of age of onset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This point was thoroughly threshed out by my hon. Friends when the National Insurance Bill, 1971, was debated in Committee. I am sure we have reread the proceedings with care and interest because the arguments used then will, no doubt, reappear again today. Indeed, my hon. Friends on that occasion moved a very similar Amendment. They wished then to get rid of this differentiation between those desperately incapacitated groups and to bring them all to the higher rate. There was a certain amount of encouragement at the time in the replies given by the Under-Secretary of State. Indeed, I was heartened to read that he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…I assure the Committee that our minds are not closed on any of these points. This is a new allowance. None of us can be absolutely sure, until we see it working in practice, whether we have got the ages right, whether we have got the steps right."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee G</i>, 18th May, 1971; 	<i>c.</i> 56.]</p></blockquote>
Therefore it is an encouraging starting point that the Under-Secretary of State has come today with an open mind, because I assume that he has not closed it in the past 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be very odd indeed if he had done so, because we have had about a year's experience of the working
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
of the new allowance and I think we can now be sure of two things. In the first place, this discrimination in the allowance on the ground of age has caused a great deal of bitterness. I have had letters from constituents about it, as a number of my hon. Friends have. A chap asked me, "Why am I only to get 60p? Why cannot I have the £1? My difficulties are acute. Why the distinction?" I had to say to him that I could not on any rational basis see why the distinction should be made—not in terms of his need, or in terms of his invalidity or in terms of his financial position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also become sure of something else as we have seen the working of the allowance, and that is that although the Government cannot argue the case for the differentiation in terms of the financial position of the beneficiaries they certainly can, and do privately, argue it in terms of the Government's financial position. It has become increasingly clear that the Government's adoption of this method of age graduation in the allowance manages by a remarkable coincidence to save a considerable sum of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Committee last year there was a long, learned and impressive argument between my hon. Friend the Member for Hitch in (Mrs. Shirley Williams), who was, no doubt, sitting in my present seat here, and the hon. Gentleman dealing with this point. They were very esoteric arguments as to whether the lowest age groups who get the highest rate have larger savings or heavier commitments than the highest age groups. I do not think the hon. Gentleman will be surprised when I tell him that anyone reading the debate must conclude that my hon. Friend won that particular argument. No doubt we shall return to it this morning. There was one fact which the hon. Gentleman made no attempt to deny and that was that his way of doing things manages to give the smallest allowance to the largest group of beneficiaries. Seldom can scientific arguments, or pseudo-scientific arguments about need have coincided more conveniently with financial saving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was rather touched by the disarming honesty of the hon. Gentleman at the time when he told the Committee that at
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
the top rate there would be 60,000 qualifying for the allowance, at the middle rate 70,000 and at the lowest rate the figure jumped to 220,000. I am sorry if we are rather cynical on this side of the Committee, but our experience of this Government in the last two years has encouraged that development. It is an interesting concatenation of events that those on the lowest rates should be by so many the more numerous. It reminds me of nothing so much as the curious coincidence between scientific arguments and financial saving that we had in the phasing-in proposals of the Government for the extension of the attendance allowance. This was an interesting parallel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends will remember that the Secretary of State, in explaining his proposals for phasing-in the extension of the qualification for attendance allowance by age groups, said, "Well, it is administratively impossible to handle half a million claims at once. So we will start with those of working age, then we will take children, then we will take the elderly and then the very elderly." There were powerful and humane arguments as to why this kind of parallel graduation should take place in that context, but the financial effect of taking that order of precedence is interesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of increasing the attendance allowance in this financial year will be £1 million. In 1973–4 the second group comes into the picture and the cost goes up to £11 million. When eventually the elderly get their turn the figure jumps to £45 million. Once again the Government have managed to find a good way, wrapped up in sociological and human arguments, for starting at the cheapest end of the scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same way, by refusing to pay the oldest groups at the highest rate, as we suggest in the Amendment, the Government are conveniently managing to save themselves £10 million. That is not a large sum, which is all the more reason why the Government should accept the Amendment. The Government are very adept at making the largest amount of political noise at the lowest cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the arguments used by the hon. Gentleman last year. Perhaps I can safely anticipate that we will hear them again today. I do hope that that open mind of his has been opening to some better effect. The hon. Gentleman argued against my hon. Friend's Amend-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0566">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
ment, saying that there were strong grounds for granting the invalidity allowance according to age. The first of his "sound grounds" was that of resources. That word must ring with a certain amount of mockery in the minds of the incapacitated poor. It sounds more like a property developer, talking about resources. The hon. Gentleman's argument was that older people have had more chance to save.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we think of the groups we are talking about that is a curious idea. It makes me wonder how remote the Government are from the living conditions of these people. It does not matter how long a person lives if he has been pretty poor all along he wil not have saved very much. People living at these income levels really find that every penny of the family income is pre-empted almost before it comes into their hands. We know what they have to do with it; surely we know the sort of budgets they have. Some of us here, at our relatively affluent level, find it pretty difficult to save, with things as they are today. When we are talking of people with income levels like this, the notion of saving takes us into Cloud Cuckoo Land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at the merits of the argument. My hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin quoted effectively from the survey by Sally Sainsbury called "Registered as Disabled". The hon. Gentleman challenged her and asked whether she was reading from the book or the research papers, because he thought the book was a bit confusing. My hon. Friend confused him by saying that she was reading from the research papers. The figures she gave showed that the older person had proved, if anything, to have a smaller and not greater capacity to save. The hon. Gentleman dismissed the Sally Sainsbury figures and quoted some of his own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Giving figures for November, 1970, he said that his statistics showed that 54 per cent. of supplementary pensioners had some savings, compared with 30 per cent. of people below pension age who were on sickness benefit and had that benefit supplemented. The Government's case for giving this older group 35p in this Bill is that 54 per cent. of supplementary pensioners had some savings. The hon. Gentleman was wise enough not to tell us what "some savings" mean. What sort of savings are we talking
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
about? £50? That is the sort of figure in the Sally Sainsbury report, and it is hardly a barometer of affluence, hardly a massive cushion against adversity, and hardly an excuse for saying that these people need only 35p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second of the hon. Gentleman's "sound arguments" was that the older group had fewer commitments. Whatever these commitments are, the income is certainly not sufficient to cover them. The hon. Gentleman gave us an illustration by saying that older people are likely to have a larger stock of durable consumer goods. I can just imagine the kitchens of these poor invalidity pension beneficiaries. I can see the stock of durable consumer goods. The washing up machine, the refrigerator, the modern electric cooker and the Kenwood mixer which they have accumulated over the years! What a lovely comforting picture! They have laid it all in over their long, hard life of struggle. There it is, shining and efficient and up to date. There is, therefore, nothing to renew with this 35p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is that the argument? How out of touch from reality! I can imagine such a home, and I can imagine the little obsolete broken-down electric fire. When people reach that age on an invalidity benefit they will not be able to renew the fire, even if it has become dangerous. It is exactly when they reach that time of life that things begin to wear out and need replacing, and the replacement of an obsolete piece of domestic equipment seems to be entirely beyond their means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, having blinded us with all this reassurance, the Under-Secretary turned to psychology. He told us there were sound psychological reasons why the onset of sickness, disability and handicap is more bearable for old people. He implied that they could grow into this disability less painfully when they were old because the loss of capacity came as more of a shock to the young. Considered in a detached way, it could be argued that as the years go by—and I am getting into the position of first-hand experience—people get accustomed to certain losses of physical reserve and of physical capacity, but consider the context here. Does not the fact that the Government can talk like that about these people show that they are hopelessly out of touch with the problem?
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0567">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Anyone would think, when the Under-Secretary talks in terms of psychology, that the Government were giving these people a great golden handshake, when they are giving them 35p. This demonstrates the sort of absurdities we get into when we stop talking about needs and start talking about undefinable qualifications like age of onset. How can we be certain that we define age of onset fairly?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this side of the Committee, through these Amendments, we want to talk about needs. Heaven knows, we are doing so very modestly. We are not putting forward some great demonstration piece to show how much warmer are our hearts than those of Government Members. We are talking about very tiny sums. Even if the Government accepted our two Amendments, so that everybody would be given £1.15 a week invalidity allowance, it would hardly be the earth. It is hardly anything to feel very virtuous about, in the context of the terrible tragedy of incapacity. There is another shortcoming in the Government's system. We are very unhappy that the whole concept of graduation in accordance with age of onset is creeping into our National Insurance system. It means that relative deprivation is eternally self-perpetuating, and it means that those who start with the least go on endlessly getting smaller increases. They never catch up, and that is a terrible source of bitterness. Like other hon. Members I have had to deal with cases of people who failed fully to qualify for the old-age pension because they were a few contributions short and, therefore, drew a modified pension. When the pension is increased they are given a modified increase in their modified pension. I do not know what they say to other hon. Members but they say to me" Barbara, because of my contributions I cannot get the full rate, but look at the little increase I have been awarded. When will this stop?" I have to say, "Never. That is an inalienable principle."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a direct link between contributions and benefits the system may be justifiable, but why import it gratuitously into the invalidity allowance, which, we are told, is separate and special? Why go out of our way to create a source of continuing bitterness?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will the older age group get to offset the appalling increase in the cost of living? They will get 5p. There is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
psychological problem here which I will explain. The psychology of this group's the psychology of desperation, and after the months of roaring inflation they are now given another 5p. Any of us in this Room would barely bother to pick it up if we dropped it in the street. So, when we look at it in these terms, we know that, in arguing the case of this graduation downwards, the Government are not talking about needs or commitments or resources: they are talking about one very simple Governmental interest—the holding down of expense. In all the arguments which, I have no doubt, the Under-Secretary will repeat to us this morning, he will probably refer to sociological grounds and not to the financial consequences which are behind them. That is why the Secretary of State insisted upon the iniquitous provision that those invalidity pensioners who are on supplementary benefit and, therefore, need help most will actually have their benefit reduced as a result of qualifying for this invalidity allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Secretary of State pointed out on Second Reading, only four-fifths of those who have been sick for more than six months will qualify. He said quite clearly that some of our chronically sick will get no benefit from this package. Some people? My calculation of his four-fifths makes "some people" amount to 80,000 out of the 400,000 who have been sick for more than six months. They will go without. There must be a saving here to enable the Government to parade the introduction of the invalidity allowance. Once again we find the Government's reforms are to be financed by the hardest hit. The Government have resurrected the old song, "It's the poor that helps the poor ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We saw this in the case of the great reforms in the invalid vehicle scheme. We were told the Government were to do something for hemophiliacs and the disabled mothers. But they did not intend to increase overall expenditure. The hemophiliacs and the disabled mothers were being helped by the other owners of invalid vehicles who lost their £5 a year petrol allowance. When I asked the Prime Minister about this in the House he rattled off a long list of improvements in the invalid vehicle scheme. When I asked how much extra would be spent on these improvements his genius for evasion flowered at the Dispatch Box. I pursued
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0568">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
him by letter, and I have now had his written admission, that the Government, for all their so-called reforms, are not going to spend one extra penny on the invalid vehicle scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sydney Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Gimmicky government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, gimmicky government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same way we are here presented with the great apparatus of argument which is designed to hide the fact that it is cheaper for the Government if they do it in the way provided in the Bill. This is the Government's obsession. We have the other iniquitous provision under which the Secretary of State has excluded from the invalidity allowance anyone qualifying within five years of retirement. There could not be a more blatant admission of the Government's calculations. No attempt has been made to justify them on scientific, psychological, needs or commitments grounds. There has been no attempt whatsoever to make a single social argument in favour of the gap, and the Government know it. The reason for the gap is, that the Government shall not further highlight the grotesque inadequacies of their proposed strategy for pension schemes. We have put down an Amendment to deal with this point which I hope you will be able to call later, Sir Stephen, and so I will not fo further into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will return to these two Amendments. Can we not start these Committee proceedings on a constructive note? Can we not start with something to warm all our hearts? Can we not start with something to ease all our consciences? Heavens above, the Under-Secretary knows the prognosis for inflation for the coming year. He as well as the rest of us has read the National Institute report. He knows that it foretells, not a successful halving of price increases, as we have been told, but, over the coming months, steadily accelerating prices which will strike horror into the hearts of the poor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He knows how much these increases are a direct consequence of Government policy. The hon. Gentleman knows what the import levy scheme in agriculture has done to prices and is going on doing to prices. He also knows what VAT will
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
do—and if he does not, I would ask him to read the National Institute report. People with meagre savings of, say, £50 have nothing to protect themselves from the consequences of the Government's Common Market policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all remember the Prime Minister's solemn pledge in making overtures in an effort to join Europe—and we all warned about the consequences on the cost of living—that the Government would seek to insulate the poorest in the land from the economic consequences of Britain's joining the E.E.C. Was the sort of insulation which was envisaged a figure of only 5p, to be paid to people of 70 or 75 years of age?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are having second thoughts about many of their policies. I have in the past in these Committee Rooms discussed great traumatic matters touching industrial relations, prices and incomes policy, and the rest. Sir Stephen, I am too old a hand—and so are you, if you will forgive the personal remark—to attempt to cover this ground extensively, but I believe it is relevant to say that the Government are having dramatic second thoughts on policy. They are having a rethink about their employment policy and what they must do to get the economy going. They are having a rethink about some policy on prices—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the right hon. Lady, but I am sure she knows that she is very near now to being out of order. She would do better to stick to the terms of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have gone out of order had I gone any further, Sir Stephen, but I was about to complete the sentence, because I can sense these rays of warning coming from the Chair. I was about to ask whether the Government would attempt a modest rethink in their insurance policy on this aspect. This matter is related to inflation and we are discussing this Amendment in the context of a reflationary Budget. The Budget embraces a sum of £2,000 million the avowed purpose of which is to get the economy going again, to put purchasing power in people's pockets and to create demand. The report of the National Institute is again relevant on this matter because it says that it does not visualise the reflationary policy which has been followed so far as being enough to reduce
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0569">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
unemployment by more than a very minimal amount, and certainly not in 12 months' time. Is it not in order to couple the desperate human need of the groups to which I have referred with the national need for economic survival?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Lady has invited me to comment on whether what she says is in order. Yes, it is in order, but she is a sufficiently experienced and able a Member to know perfectly well that if she goes over the general economic situation, involving election pledges and other such matters, it will mean that other hon. Members will inevitably want to follow her example. I know how the right hon. Lady can hop in and out of order, but other hon. Members may not be so knowledgeable. I hope that she will stick to the terms of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Sir Stephen, for calling me an experienced Member. I am also a kindly Member, and this is why I do not intend to resurrect the question of election promises. I leave that to the Committee's imagination. Memories of election promises are near the surface at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to restrain myself in keeping in order, but I find it difficult to restrain myself in making an urgent and genuine plea to the hon. Gentleman. Is he saying this morning that the Government, indeed the country, cannot afford a sum of £10 million which I have been told in a Written Answer would be the cost of putting these two Amendments into effect? Is he saying that in a Budget provision of £2,000 million, which has proved inadequate to reflate the economy, he cannot find room for this?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of the proposal clearly is relevant. May I suggest how the cost should be met? Our proposition is that it could well be met, not by putting any more burdens on employees, or even on employers, but by such a modest increase in Exchequer contribution that this handout Government would barely notice it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make this serious and sincere plea on two grounds. I make it first on the ground of principle. I beg the hon. Gentleman not to continue to import into the National Insurance system these invidious distinctions by age groups. I beg him not to do so in a context in which it is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
mockery to talk of whether one group has more resources than another, or more commitments, or more electric kettles, or electric fires, than another. It is a mockery to argue on those lines when we are talking about a few pence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second ground for pressing these Amendments is that of humanity. I pay tribute to the Government for having introduced an invalidity allowance. However, I beg the hon. Gentleman not to ruin the principle by any gesture of niggardliness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not proposing dramatic overall increases across the board. We are making one simple request on sound sociological and human grounds. Please eliminate these distinctions by groups and put all those who qualify for invalidity allowance on the higher rate, namely, £1.15p. If this is done, we might sleep more easily at nights, though we would not be entitled to any very self-congratulatory dreams. I beg the hon. Gentleman seriously to consider this proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Mervyn Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard a vivid, telling, serious and sincere speech by the right hon. Lady and there is very little—apart from the political content, with which I would not be expected to agree—with which I would disagree. I will not attempt to provide a valid answer to her political comments since I would put myself out of order, which would not be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree that we want to wring as much money as possible out of the Government. The right hon. Lady has been in Government and is now in Opposition; she knows that as a back bencher one's main anxiety is to wring as much out of the Government as one can, whatever party is in power. Certainly, as constituency Members we welcome the fact that there should be an overall allowance to get rid of so many hardships and difficult cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing today very much with the question of the allocation of resources. However, the right hon. Lady was a little less than fair in painting her picture of the elderly. It was a telling and vivid picture, and I detract in no way from the facts of hardship she put forward, but she did not paint the whole picture, and that is what we must look at. We are talking about the support which can be given by the community to those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
in need and to those suffering from disabilities, and support to invalids. The right hon. Lady made no mention of the support given by the community as a whole. We all know that money is important and that there is no substitute for it, but in many cases involving the old, the disabled, and those who are ill, the support given by a community matters almost more than a few more pence in somebody's pocket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to consider the sort of progress which we are now making and which we want to see, in terms of support to invalids, sheltered housing, supporting services and voluntary services. Voluntary services are extremely important and are not to be regarded as charity in the sense of doing something for nothing. They show that the community cares and that there is much feeling behind the service which is provided; it is the sort of companionship which is allied with a community's support services which is important. The Government have given and are giving more money to these services, and I want to see more money given. Let us not forget the support which a family can and should give in our society to those who are old. I am not saying that the young family must support its elderly relatives and that they are to depend on charity, but we would be doing a disservice if we did not put great emphasis on the generous and willing help which can be given in terms of the happiness, well being and welfare of elderly people. We must take these matters into account when considering the whole picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to mention the role of industry in this respect. I work in industry and I am anxious that the person who has ended his working life should be considered. In looking at pension schemes and industrial welfare schemes we should look to see how we can assist and support those people who may have become invalid or broken in health because of the contribution they have made to our industrial life. So many of our big undertakings, like the Post Office, of which I have personal knowledge, and the Coal Board, give help and support of this kind. I do not say that these are substitutes for money, but if we are filling in the picture of resources, we should have these things in our minds when judg-
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
ing, with three categories of people, who will suffer the hardest burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the right hon. Lady will agree that the young person of working age with a family bears the greatest expense. I am not talking about the amount of savings. I agree that that is almost infinitesimal. They start almost with a deficit, with mortgage and hire-purchase payments and the rest. A young family is an increasing expense. I would rather that we did not consider this as a question of priorities, but if we do, we cannot get away from the fact that the young working population bears the hardest burden—not just psychological, although that is probably the worst, but financially as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I would ask the Committee to consider the full picture and not forget that the support of the family by the community is as important as, but no substitute for, the money which we give by way of invalidity allowance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Melton (Miss Pike) is in favour of the Amendment or the Government's proposals. Of course it is desirable to bear in mind all the re-resources provided by the State and voluntary organisations, but I do not know whether she favoured the three categories of invalidity allowance or the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be consistent, I am supporting the Amendment, since I did so in Committee last year and shall probably do so next year and the year after if we are still cursed with these three gradations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) made a compassionate and detailed speech, presenting the most well-reasoned case for the allowance being paid only at the highest rate because of the need of those whom it is supposed to benefit. When the allowance was introduced, as part of the Crossman Plan, it was welcomed by both sides, and no one was more pleased than hon. Members on this side, but having three different payment levels depending on age is a case of spoiling the ship for a ha'p'orth of tar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a Parliamentary Question on 5th June my right hon. Friend asked the Secretary of State the cost of paying the allowance at the highest rate for all. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0571">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
answer was £15 million gross or £10 million net. That is a tiny amount compared with the vast sums which the Government have recently unleashed, and could profitably be spent on this needy group. We should take into account not only the small amount which the Amendment suggests but also the present economic climate as described by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In his Budget Statement, he announced tax reductions of £1,200 million for the year 1972–73 and went on to boast that the burden of taxation in the coming year, as a consequence of various Government measures, had been reduced by over £3,000 million. This shows how miserly is our treatment of this allowance. There is no real justification for these differences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only possible explanation should be cost. Figures show that, of men drawing sickness benefit for over six months, the group who will benefit by the allowance, about 15,000 are under 35 and receive the highest rate of £1.15p, about 28,000 are between 35 and 44 and will receive the middle rate of 70p, and nearly 133,000 are over 45 and will receive the lowest rate of 35p. So we are giving the smallest increase to the very largest group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious that, numerically, it is the oldest people who suffer most from invalidity, but the degree of suffering is not related to age. It is related to the degree of disability. A young person, a middle-aged person or an old person has the same need if it is dependent only upon the degree of invalidity, it should not be related to age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these points were debated at some length last time. On 3rd May, 1971, giving us his reason for the three rates, the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The thought in our mind is that during a normal working life, a man or woman should perhaps be able to put aside something towards old age."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 3rd May, 1971; Vol. 816, 	<i>c</i>. 1015.]</p></blockquote>
"Perhaps" he might, but, equally, perhaps he might not. The amount paid does not take that into account; it assumes that all will have made some savings. The Answer also seems to assume that all the savings would be to deal with the problem of old age and not with the added problem of invalidity. That cannot be a serious excuse for not paying the allowance at the highest rate
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
only. In the last 12 months many people have asked me for some explanation of this. I have shown them the Minister's speech to see whether they could explain it. Most of them have found it absolute nonsense. The idea that the vast majority or even a reasonable proportion of elderly people entitled to invalidity allowance have been able to save is just nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were also told last time that many of these people would benefit from sick pay schemes. Some will, but many will not. Having three rates does not take into account those who do not benefit from savings or sick pay schemes. The poorest people in our society are the oldest, and the absolute poorest are the oldest who are disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of us who has served on Committees with the Under-Secretary will doubt his sincerity on these issues, but I would ask him to cast his mind back to what he said in Committee last year. Talking of the invalidity allowance, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the ages and amounts are not immutable. They can easily be changed if experience of this new allowance suggests that we have not decided on the right ages, that we have not achieved the right graduation of these amounts within these ages. But there are strong reasons why we think that we have probably got it about right."—[OFFICIAL REPORT. 	<i>Standing Committee G;</i> 18th May, 1971; 	<i>c</i>. 76.]</p></blockquote>
Since then, has he decided that those reasons justify the operation of three rates? Has he any further evidence to show that the three amounts in the Bill, which are almost mathematical increases on the previous ones, are right? Without some overwhelming evidence from the Minister, we should vote for the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate on an important subject. In an interesting speech, the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) put over the point which is heard so often—that only a little more is being requested. But, as my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Miss Pike) said, this Amendment, like any other, is a question of resources and priorities, and the question is nothing like as simple as asking for just a little more. We cannot consider such an Amendment in isolation. We must see it in relation to a host of other priorities which both sides are anxious to meet as effectively as resources will allow.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0572">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
The right hon. Lady was very much less than fair when she tried to isolate this allowance from all the other help available to invalids and disabled people and from the new allowances which have been introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Lady spoke, for example, of the increase of 5p for the lower level of the allowance, but this, of course, is on top of the increase in the invalidity pension which all these pensioners will be getting. In fairness, she should have talked not about 5p but about 80p single and £1.25 married, because that is the total increase in benefits which this Clause is providing for these invalidity pensioners. That, of course, is a fairly substantial increase when one takes into account that the allowance was introduced for the first time only last September and that it is being uprated within slightly over 12 months of its introduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact of the matter, as is clear from the Government Actuary's report, is that the total cost of invalidity benefits—here I include invalidity pensions and invalidity allowance—might well amount to £181 million in 1972–73 and £195 million in 1973–74. Fairly substantial sums are thus being made available in invalidity pensions and the invalidity allowance. The total cost of the invalidity allowance itself, which is a completely new benefit which did not exist before last September, is about £9 million a year. I do not claim this to be a substantial sum, but it is fair to recognise that we are dealing with a completely new benefit introduced last year and which is in addition to other benefits which the people who are getting the invalidity allowance are already entitled to, and the other benefits are themselves being uprated by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the only new benefit made available for the disabled. The right hon. Lady referred to the attendance allowance. Here again, perhaps, I can correct her figures. The figure she gave when she talked of providing money which would be spent on the attendance allowance during this year and next year was purely the increase involved in the uprating of the allowance. What really matters is the total sums which are being spent on the new allowance. The total sum in 1972–73 will be about £23 million, in contrast with nil in June, 1970, when we came to office, and £25 million in 1973–74. That is the
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
cost of the allowance as uprated to the new level as from October this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to that there is the extension of the attendance allowance. The Bill proposes that in a later Clause. Here, the additional costs will be about £11 million in 1973–74, rising to about £45 million ultimately. This means that the attendance allowance will have risen, by the time the new extension is in operation in 1973–74, to a total of £70 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not quote these figures in any spirit of complacency, but they show another area in which progress, and much needed progress, is being made in better provision for the disabled members of our community. Other forms of help are being made available. There is the higher rate for dependants of invalidity pensioners; which, again, is a new improvement in our arrangement. There is the more favourable earnings rule for the working wives of invalidity pensioners—again, an improvement for them. As my hon. Friend the Member for Melton so rightly pointed out, there is the increase going on all the time in the much-needed community and voluntary services, and surely it is only fair that one should take the complete picture of what is being done, rather than just pick on one aspect, which is what the right hon. Lady tended to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn against that background to the reasons for these three levels for the allowance. The right hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones), who took part in the same debate last year, referred to some of the points I made then when I said that our minds were not closed, that this was a new allowance, and that all of us were anxious to learn by experience whether we had used the resources available for the allowance in the best possible way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our minds are still open, but I am bound to say that no arguments have been advanced this morning to show that these three levels are wrong or what the alternatives should be. I am not complaining about this, but the only argument is that we should be spending twice as much on the allowance as we are. The hon. Member for Rhondda, West, said that the division is nonsense, but he did not say why, or what would be a better distribution of the resources available. I would have been more impressed by the Opposition's argument if, in addition to urging us to spend more on the allowance, they had addressed themselves also
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0573">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
to how they would use the amount of money which is available for this allowance if more is not to be made available—how they would distribute it in a different form which, they believe, would be more effective for the needs of those concerned. We did not have any suggestions on this from the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can now tell the Committee why, in our judgment, from a fairly small experience up to now, the balance between the three levels is right in the circumstances and given the limitations on resources. The arguments are very similar to those I used last year. I do not suggest that I have come forward with a whole new array of arguments. The ones used last year have stood the test of a short experience—and I admit that it is short—of the allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These arguments centre on three aspects: the likely resources of the people concerned; the likely commitments of these people; and the psychological factors involved. First, then, I will deal with the question of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Older people, as I think the Committee would agree, tend to have more savings and resources than do younger people. I am, of course, speaking relatively here. I do not want in any sense to overstate my argument. For example, a survey, carried out by the Department of National Savings early in 1968, of savings currently held by people in different age bands showed that the higher age groups had higher savings, and equally, of course, that people who were younger tended to have less chance to accumulate any appreciable provision under occupational health schemes or things of that kind. Equally, of course, the older age groups, fortunately in growing numbers today, tend to have cover either through occupational sick pay arrangements or through occupational pensions themselves. So I think one can fairly say that on grounds of resources the needs of the younger group are greater than the needs of the older groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to commitments. I agree with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Melton. I think the whole Committee accepts that the commitments of the younger family man with young children are likely to be greater than the commitments of people who are older. The chances are that the younger people will have young children, and this
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
will make it more difficult for the wife to go out to work and supplement the earnings. The younger people are more likely to be buying their homes and will be entering the housing market later than older people and, therefore, at a markedly higher level of prices. Equally, they may have a lower stock of durable consumer goods than older people. So I think, too, that on grounds of commitment one can make out a good case for giving the higher allowance to the younger age group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, thirdly, the psychological factor, and the right hon. Lady conceded at any rate that the psychological effect of disability tends to be greater on a younger person than on an older person. This was well illustrated in the experience of the attendance allowance. Although the attendance allowance is available to all age groups we found it very much more difficult to persuade older people to apply for it, even after a substantial publicity campaign had been put into operation. This is probably because as people get older they accept more than younger people do that disability in one form or another is likely to be their lot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not wish to misrepresent me in any way—or perhaps I did not make myself clear. I agree, of course, that there may be the psychological factor—the shock factor—in the younger person. What I was trying to show was that if we give the older person 35p a week there is an equally difficult and important psychological factor—the psychology of desperation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there are these factors which the right hon Lady has fairly pointed out, but here again one has to weigh them against the point I have made that the likelihood is that older groups will have more adequate resources and lower commitments. The experience of the attendance allowance probably suggests fairly strongly that the younger age groups are hit hardest psychologically by the onset, very often sudden, of disability—harder than the older groups are who are moving towards retirement or have actually retired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the three main reasons why we feel, after the experience of 12 months of the new allowance, that this is the best allocation of the resources. We have had very few complaints about the dis-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
tinction. Clearly, there are problems in such decisions, and I freely admit it, but we have had no strong body of opinion coming forward to suggest that the balance between these three is the wrong one. In view of that it would be wiser to continue with the existing pattern of the allowance while keeping our minds open as to whether this is the right balance. If it proves later on that we could use the resources available more effectively in a different way we would be the first to propose that that should be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of the proposals contained in the Amendment would be about £10 million gross, £7 million net, allowing for the offsetting of supplementary benefits. In other words, it practically doubles the amount of money made available for invalidity allowances. This inevitably raises the question of resources and relativities. The right hon. Lady said that this was only a little bit extra, but it is a little bit on top of a substantial additional bill for pensions and other benefits which will have to be borne, rightly, by the existing contributors and taxpayers. It would be in addition to nearly £500 million which has to be found for the improvements in this Bill and which will mean substantial increases in contributions, particularly for the higher-paid. It will mean increasing contributions from employers and an increase in the Exchequer supplement from the taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for these reasons that I cannot advise the Committee to accept the Amendment, although I give the assurance, which I gave last year, that we shall certainly continue to watch the workings of this allowance to satisfy ourselves that whatever money is available for the allowance is used in a way which appears to be the most effective way of relieving the needs of those eligible for the allowance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister invariably makes an attractive speech, but always in Committees of this kind I feel that they are probably not the best machinery with which to examine such problems. For many years now I have served on Select Committees of investigation in which we can now examine Ministers in greater depth than in Standing Committee, in which the Minister makes a ten minute or quarter of an
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
hour speech and that is the end of it. My right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) makes a rather more lengthy and pungent speech, but the end result is foreseeable: the vote will be taken, we know what the result will be and the whole thing seems to be very unsatisfactory. In Standing Committee we cannot discuss these problems in the depth which they merit. Of course the hon. Member for Melton (Miss Pike) is right. When we are discussing these problems invariably the Government stand by their proposals and the Opposition ups them. It is a kind of political auction. We know the drill, we know the end result. It is all so predictable as to be completely boring in that sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing this, as we would discuss other Amendments dealing with the question of allocation of the national resources, on the basis of political judgments. We can differ. That is why we are in Parliament—because we differ in our political judgments about the distribution of national resources. I was astounded by the last few sentences of the Minister's speech when he said that the net effect of the Amendment was £7 million. That is a rather different figure from that which he gave my right hon. Friend in Answer to a Question a few weeks ago. However, that is a relatively minor point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly argues that if he concedes this Amendment, because it is just a little one, then he destroys any argument he has on subsequent Amendments when we say that it is just a little more. There is something in that, but when we look at the Amendment in the context of the whole of the Government's economic strategy in the fiscal and social spheres since they came into office we are bound to wonder what is the basic philosophy behind their thinking. We get the impression, and I think it is the impression in the country, that they are, by and large, redistributing the resources in favour of the better-off section as against the people who are the poorer section of the community. It is perfectly true that they have increased retirement pensions and that they are to be reviewed annually instead of biennially. All of these things are improvements, but compared with what has been given at the other end of the scale there is no doubt that over the last two years the gap
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
between the very poor, about whom we are now talking, and the very rich has widened and is widening. This Bill, taken in the context of the Government's economic strategy, will do nothing or very little to narrow the gap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are we talking about in this invalidity allowance Amendment? The biggest increase in the Schedule is 15p. The Minister linked that with the invalidity pension, which is a valid point, but on the invalidity allowance the biggest increase per week is 15p. Today that amount will not buy quarter of a pound of beef. That is what we are talking about. This is not to be given to millions of people; it is not millions of tons of beef per week or year. There are fewer than 200,000 people involved. We are arguing that an extra £7 million should be given to them. One new Concorde will cost the mugs who buy it £23 million. There are the priorities we are talking about, and there is a basic difference of philosophy between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disclosing no secret when I say that I have never feared skeletons in the cupboard of the Labour Government. Every Opposition can claim that the previous Government did not do enough. They always do. Some of us, even when our own Government were in power, said that they were not doing enough. I went to meetings of old-age pensioners time after time between 1964 and 1970 and I said that we ought to be ashamed in society as a whole at the way we were treating our old people. We ought still to be ashamed. If I were on the Government side I would be defending what the Government are doing because it is in some ways better than what we did. When we get back at the next election we will do better than they are now doing. This is the way the social services have to advance, but there is no doubt in the mind of the general public that the Labour Party has got the edge over the Conservatives. The impression among the millions of ordinary men and women who work on the shop floor or who are retired is that they will get a better deal from this side of the Committee than from the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady the Member for Melton talked about family support for the old people and the support of voluntary organisations. I pay tribute to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
voluntary organisations. My own wife died in the cause of serving in a voluntary capacity in the East End of London. I pay tribute to these organisations, but basically poverty and hardship is touched only marginally by such organisations. They are a very small supplement to what the State can and must provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Lady talked about old people being looked after by their families my mind went back—I am old enough to remember it—to the time when the old Poor Law insisted that the family should take the groceries along to the old folk. They were compelled to disclose their resources, to ascertain whether the younger people could support their families. Opponents of the Welfare State argue that it is a regrettable fact that we have made such generous State provision that we have obviated, or at any rate reduced, the necessity for a family to look after its old folk. Increased mobility often means that a family moves from Scotland or the North-East down to London and the old folk are left behind and are told, "The State will provide for you." In that respect we are less civilised than the most ancient civilisations in Africa and Asia. There the family is a unit and remains a unit. The younger members of the family still regard it is a paramount obligation to look after the old—much more than we do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This development which has taken place will continue over the years. Because of increased mobility, increased welfare provision, for which we should not apologise, the older and more poverty stricken members of the community must depend to a far greater degree on the State than on voluntary services or on the younger members of their families. I do not like the reproach that we have increased reliance on the State for family provision, nor do I like the idea that voluntary societies, although I have the greatest respect for such associations—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come at once to the invalidity allowance. The Minister adduced three basic arguments for the division of this into three categories. First, he made a general proposition which he supported by quoting a report, which I have not seen, which suggested that older people tend to have more savings than younger people. A generalisation of that kind, however backed up by authoritative sources, is not enough. We must look at the social classes within that generalisation, because it is simply not true to say that older people—in mining communities, for example—tend to have more savings than younger people in Social Group 1. Those in Social Group V, the lowest social group, whether they are old or young, will have little or no savings. In Social Group 1 a man aged 35 will have more savings than the older man in Social Group V. So that a generalisation like that is pretty worthless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could just put this point to the hon. Member. I think he would concede that at least some of the older people, and a growing number, will have savings in the form of occupational pension or sick pay schemes which are available to them from their employers, whereas the younger persons will almost invariably have much more limited resources from that source, if any.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Generalisations of that kind are extremely dangerous and they are not good enough for a Ministerial statement. I represent what was a mining community. It consists in large measure of old miners. They have an occupational scheme, to which I have
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
referred in the House many times, and which is completely worthless. I attach no blame to Ministers for that because it was negotiated between the National Coal Board and the National Union of Mine-workers. It provides a basic pension of £1.50 a week, and a man could have worked in the pits for 50 years to get that basic occupational pension. So the Minister should not rest his case too much on the occupational schemes from which the older people are benefiting. Manual workers by and large have hopeless occupational pension schemes. One of the great weaknesses of strategy for pensions is this increased reliance on occupational schemes, especially for manual workers. As I said on Second Reading, the unions should seek to negotiate much more generous occupational schemes for workers on the shop floor. The Minister embarrassed me by supporting me in principle on that point, and I was chastised in my constituency for it! [	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can ride that one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second argument the Minister used was the suggestion that the needs of the younger groups are, generally speaking, greater because of children, hire-purchase commitments, mortgages, and so on. This is a generalisation which is right, but again it depends upon the social groupings. Among the wealthier 5 per cent or 10 per cent. of the community it is not true. In the lower groups, Social Groups IV or V it is, of course, true, particularly now that housing accommodation is so difficult to buy or rent and when the Government's new rent schemes will make it increasingly difficult for these people to acquire accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third argument was the most valid of the three. The psychological effect of invalidity is very much greater on younger people, I would have thought, than it is on older people. I suppose there must be some authoritative research on this matter. This is the kind of question we could examine in depth in a pre-legislation Select Committee which would be ideal for discussion about a Bill of this kind. But I will not develop that argument now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that his mind was not closed yet. I do not know when it will be closed. In new proposals, when drawing lines on age and allowances, a degree of arbitrariness is involved. For example, why choose the age
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0577">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
of 35? Why not 36 or 34? There is no scientific argument for 35. Who decided 35, who decided 45, and who decided 60? Was it the civil servants? Did someone in the Ministry say that 35 sounds like a good age at which a psychological barrier will be erected, while at 34 it will not? Did someone say that at 60 that psychological barrier will be less than at 61 or 59? There will always be someone who is one day on the wrong side of the line, wherever the line is drawn. The more we can eliminate these arbitrary lines the better. This is one of the reasons why I support the Amendments. I would be acquitted of the charge of being called a non-party politician, but in matters like this we must try to be as non-party as we can. I support the Amendments because I am against the drawing of lines, and the flat-rate allowance would eliminate the problem. My second reason is that the £7 million proposed is a derisory figure in terms of the national income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend noticed the gross sex discrimination in subsection (3,	<i>c</i>)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am hoping we will come to that later. I, too, have strong views about discrimination between the sexes. This is hardly defensible, and the Government are also coming round to the view that it is indefensible, but the provision is in the Bill. The Under-Secretary did not touch on that point, but may be my hon. Friends will when they speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a useful debate, and I do not want to delay the Committee any longer. If we can carry the spirit of this debate throughout our discussion, it will have served a useful purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any reasonable person who listened carefully to what the Minister said would be embarrassed by the threadbare nature of his arguments against the case which was so eloquently and passionately put by my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle). It seems extremely curious that the main argument which the Minister sought to use was based on the question of priority. This is certainly the right context in which to argue this and other Amendments to the Bill, but it seemed to me quite extraordinary that the Minister should argue the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apology for adopting
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
exactly the kind of approach which he initiated. He said it was unreasonable to look simply at the increase in the cost of the invalidity allowance, and that we had to take into account the cost of the invalidity benefit in general and the other various upratings and improvements for the disabled. To be even more generous to him we could include also the extra assistance which is being given by the Bill to the elderly, because it is all meshed together, and it is in this context that we must consider it. If we are to argue the language of priorities we must look not only at the amount of money the Government have made available, on the welfare side, because this is only one means of assisting members of the community, but also at their fiscal measures, because these are equally forms of assistance. We must make a direct comparison between the fiscal aid which the Government have been able to afford, and the assistance to the elderly and the disabled under the Bill. We must clearly take into account the Exchequer contribution towards the cost of the increases, as opposed to the increase paid for by higher contributions. If we are to make a comparison with fiscal aid, it is the Exchequer contribution which counts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first National Insurance Bill Exchequer contribution was around £100 million. In this Bill it is around £85 million but we must add in the £15 million tax concession, which is made for this year alone and under which the increase will not be taxable. Let us assume that there is a round figure of about £200 million, and about 8 million persons will benefit from the Bill. A significant section of these are directly affected by the Amendment. Simple arithmetic shows that they have gained about £25 each. In contrast, the tax relief given to those at the higher end of the income scale, conveniently determined as those earning more than £5,000 a year, amounted in this Government's first Budget to £350 million and in the second Budget to £145 millions. These people number slightly more than 250,000 and this gives a gain per person of £1,900 per year. This must be compared with the Government's intention to spend £7 million to lessen the admitted hardship of the people covered by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that the in-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
crease was not to be taken as purely 5p, that we had to consider the 75p uprating in the invalidity allowance, making a total of 80p. The hon. Gentleman called this "fairly substantial". That is rich coming from a Government spokesman who has given £1,900 per year to those at the top end of the scale and who has given £600 extra per year to those in the range of £2,000 to £5,000 a year. To compare those sums with the tiny sum which is involved in this argument is adding insult to injury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that we must look not only at the question of uprating but at the basic amount. I disagree with this argument because I feel that we are looking at the extra resources which are put into people's pockets. This is what the Bill, and, indeed, Budgets as a whole, are all about. The basic amount is not at issue. We are talking about an extra amount, and are considering whether it is adequate. Even accepting the hon. Gentleman's argument, which I do not accept, when one compares the amounts which are being given to these groups with what the Government say they are able to afford, they surely are tiny sums. They are an insult to those to whom the Bill is supposed to be directed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the £7 million could be better allocated as between the different age groups. He blocked the question as to why there should be a definite total of £7 million. I wish to refer to a Written Answer given by the Secretary of State on precisely this point in which he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At the rates proposed in the National Insurance Bill the annual cost would be about £15 million gross or £10 million net after adjustments of supplementary benefit had been taken into account."</p></blockquote>
I do not understand the discrepancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I can clear this up. I have not the Answer before me, but I am fairly certain that it gives the total cost of the increase. The figure I gave was as to the cost of the two Amendments taken together.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will hand the Written Answer to the hon. Gentleman. It seems clear that the Question sought to discover the total cost, and it was the hon. Gentleman himself who spoke about a cost of £7 million. We are dealing with relatively small sums, and one hopes that the Department can get its sums right. Perhaps if we table a further Question the cost will drop to £5 million. I am wondering at what point the cost will fade almost to zero.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have now got the matter sorted out. Now that the hon. Gentleman has handed me the Answer, which I did not have before me when he raised the matter, I think I can clear up this point. The difference between the two figures is that the Answer given by my right hon. Friend on 5th June embraced the Opposition Amendment which we are now discussing, plus additional Amendments which are Starred and which we are not discussing with the other Amendment, which would add to the cost. Therefore the figure given by my right hon. Friend relates to all the Opposition Amendments, including those relating to persons above the age of 55, whereas the figure I gave was directly related to the Opposition Amendments which we are now discussing. That explains the difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are getting more confused. Is the hon.

The Secretary of State was answering a simple Question about payment of invalidity allowance and a higher rate to all the beneficiaries and referred to a figure of £10 million. Now the hon. Gentleman is saying that the Secretary of State is not taking into account all our Amendments and that the cost is higher, namely, £7 million.

Apart from what the final figure turns out to be, the point remains that £7 to £10 million is a tiny figure in comparison with the sums of money which the Government have felt able to give to other groups in the population. The Minister specifically excluded any consideration of why the figure should be only £7 million. Why is the extra amount so impossible when so much is given to other groups? We want an answer to this crucial question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is obviously a limitation in terms of the global sum, but within the total it cannot be said that £7 million is completely ruled out, nor is it a proper question of priorities merely to ask how within this tiny total it is better to distribute these resources. We are being put in an artificial position by the hon. Gentleman, who has put himself in a position of having to answer in an inappropriate way. We are not in the agonising position of having to decide whether there is a greater
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
psychological shock to those under the age of 35 or to those between the age of 45 and 60. It is a question of priorities, and plainly, the Government have decided that their priorities do not lie with the elderly and disabled. If the Minister wishes to disagree with that I should be glad to give way. I see that he does not wish to do so. I take it that he accepts that, although these increases are welcome, they are not the priorities upon which the Government chiefly have their eyes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the points raised by the hon. Member for Melton (Miss Pike). She emphasised that we were not merely concerned with money but with the provision of services in kind which could mitigate the niggardly offer in the Bill. The point about voluntary and community services is that they are extremely varied. They often depend on one or two persons in an area who devote their lives to a particular group. The situation depends on whether such groups exist. The problem is that there is no rationalisation of what otherwise is a haphazard operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady mentioned sheltered housing and other services. These are extremely important, but are in no sense an alternative to an increase in money. They are aside from the real issue which we are debating this morning. Money—perhaps unfortunately in our society—remains utterly essential, and it is unreasonable to suggest that the provision of certain voluntary services in certain areas can in any way diminish the reasonableness of the demand in these Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was scraping the bottom of the barrel for the Minister to suggest, as a reason for not being able to afford £7 million, the psychology of shock and, therefore, discrimination between old and young. Such an argument cannot be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard the argument that older people have more savings and that, therefore, in terms of concentrating resources on those in greatest need, they need not be given so much, indeed the hon. Gentleman quoted a survey containing evidence that the old have greater material resources. We know how small are those resources and would ask the Minister to quantify his evidence. Will he say the amounts by which they exceed resources available to the younger generation? Will he give the absolute amounts?

Is it a figure of £50, £100, £300 or £500? At what point are people expected to use that capital? Is it not reasonable that if they have the security of a few hundred pounds they can keep it, rather than have to spend it on the disabilities which are no fault of theirs and against which they may not have had the opportunity to protect themselves?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also said that the older worker is better protected by occupational pension schemes or employers' sick pay Schemes. I am quoting from the Department of Employment 	<i>Gazette</i> for August, 1971, which provides the latest information available about the distribution of employers' sick pay and capital benefits. This relates to April, 1970, and it makes interesting reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among lower paid manual workers—say, those earning £15 to £17 a week; I am not being particularly selective—the coverage of occupational pension schemes is 35 per cent. So the first evidence is that the lower earning grades are very poorly covered. To suggest that if they are also older members of these grades they will be properly protected is unreasonable. The facts do not substantiate what the Minister has said. When one considers membership of occupational schemes by age, it is true that for manual workers the proportion rises. For the 21 to 24 age group, it is 21 per cent. It rises to 41 per cent. in the 60 to 64 age group. So there is a rise, but even at the higher end it is still only two-fifths who are covered and three-fifths who are not. Among non-manual workers the proportion covered by these schemes is 44 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not true that the proportion covered by employers' pension schemes rises with age. The exact opposite is true. In the 21 to 24 age group the proportion is 58 per cent. It drops to 43 per cent. in the 40 to 46 age group, rises to 48 per cent. in the 50 to 59 age group, but drops to 33 per cent. in the 60 to 64 group. So there is a decline, with a peak towards the end, in the membership of employers' pension schemes by age. It just is not true, if one combines manual and non-manual workers, that older workers are necessarily better protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence with regard to sick pay pay schemes is that the coverage is higher—on average, about 70 per cent. For manual workers, the proportion rises from
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
64 per cent. to 77 per cent.—not a lot of difference between the bottom and the top of the age group. That is for men. For women, the proportion is hardly different at all. For those under 18, the proportion who are members of employers' sick pay schemes is 65 per cent.; it rises to 67 per cent. in the highest age group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it is not true that older workers have more resources and the second main arm of the Minister's argument collapses. They do not have significantly more resources either of the private pension or of the private sick pay scheme kind and I suspect, without knowing the hon. Gentleman's source, that the amount of extra resources in their private homes which they have accumulated over the years is tiny in amount and that the difference between them and the younger generation is relatively very small. There is no justification on those grounds for providing more for the younger than for the older disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Going further with his argument, it is only fair to ask how far workers can save. The basic idea, which, I suspect, is another of the middle-class ideals in which all good workers are supposed to indulge, is that they all save. What sort of level are we talking about? Is it considered possible to save on under £20 a week, the wage of the lowest tenth of workers? It is not possible. It is precisely these people who are not members of employers' sick pay and pension schemes, because it is not worth the employer's while to enrol them: it is more trouble to him than it is worth. How does the Minister expect us to take the argument that older workers should get less because they have had more opportunity to save? At what level can we start to save significantly in today's society? We may regret this, and may want to encourage people in the virtues of thrift, but can one start laying aside significant sums on wages of less than £25 gross a week? I doubt whether there is any significant saving for old age below that level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not yet had the answer to the point raised by my hon. Friend, the Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones) that people save for old age if they save at all and not for the extra and unforeseeable effects of disability. It is not possible to put aside enough money for what may be a long old age and at the same time to cover oneself against the increasing effects of infirmity or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
sudden disability caused by industrial injury or accident. It does not make sense, considering the situation of manual workers making out in today's world, or in past years, to suggest that they can do this. There is no justification on these grounds for discrimination by age. I should be grateful if the Minister would apply himself to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Marsden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should realise that people on £25 cannot save. If they are paid on a Thursday, their money is all gone by the following Wednesday, and they are waiting for their pay on the Thursday night. I am surprised that anyone in this Committee can be so naïve as to suggest that a man can save on that figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that corroboration. I am sure that the Minister would agree that it is the Government's philosophy that people should now spend, if we are generating a consumer boom, and that we do not want them to save—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is anti-social.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, highly undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But even if someone has saved, the Minister has not said how far he expects capital to be wound down by these accidents and misfortunes of life in later years. There is a discrepancy here between the arrangements under the supplementary benefit regulations and what the Minister now suggests. Under those regulations, a man does not lose supplementary benefit so long as his capital does not exceed £325. He only loses a small extra amount as his income rises towards £800 and later on towards £1,000. Under the Minister's suggestion, the man is being expected to use his capital. He has been given 30p, now to be raised to 35p, which any reasonable person must regard as miserly. The amount of extra benefit in invalidity allowance is such that there are very few people here who would bother to stop to pick it up. Yet the recipient is at the same time being expected, because he has allegedly saved, to run down his capital resources. How fast does the Minister expect those resources to decline? Does he expect the man to spend to the limit of his capital? After all, if he is not claiming supplementary benefit, there is no protection in terms of his capital by the Minister's argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
The corollary of this argument is that, because the younger worker is not expected to be able to save, the £1, now increased to £1.15p, is regarded, presumably, as a substitute for saving. How can one seriously regard that amount as a substitute for the saving of the elderly worker? Does it seriously compare with the cost of disability? I appreciate that it is on top of the invalidity pension, so we are talking about a total of £6.80p, but is that itself adequate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) asked how these figures were reached and raised the question of the age discrimination. I presume that the Minister's answer, although not ours, is that, administratively, one must draw the line somewhere. I would ask who decided these amounts. On what research evidence are they based. Did the Department take into account the very important findings of Sally Sainsbury's study? Did it take into account the evidence of differences between the handicapped and the impaired in Great Britain? Or was a decision taken that assistance of £7 million would be given and that it could best be distributed by this means, without being based on any research findings at all?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has given no justification. I take it that the Disablement Income Group has impressed on him many times that, for the disabled, even the simplest things in life cost a great deal. It costs far more to travel. One cannot go out and get a bus—one may have to order a taxi. One goes through clothes at a faster rate. Because of immobility, one needs extra clothes and one needs them more often. How far can it seriously be maintained that even the highest of these sums is related to what are known empirically to be the costs of disablement? One cannot pluck a figure out of the air and distribute it in this way without relating it to a target. What are our targets? What are the extra costs of disability? How far has the Minister considered the extra economic expenses of the disabled, from the mildly disabled to the appreciably handicapped and the severely handicapped? There are great differences between these groups. How far have these figures been decided on this kind of rational basis?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not be asked to accept a mere uprating of these figures. As my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
right hon. Friend said, that merely perpetuates relative deprivation, if one starts with a figure which is based on no empirical findings. How were those basic figures originally determined? We have not had an answer to that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned priorities, without saying why we have a total of £7 million only to play with. He mentioned saving, but I would contend that, if he read the Government's own publications, he would see that the evidence goes against his argument. On the question of the psychology of shock, he cannot honestly expect us to accept a discrimination like this sheerly on that basis, when we are talking about so small a sum as £7 million. I hope that he will
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
seriously consider our arguments. This is not a small matter; it is of desperate concern to the people involved.

One of my constituents was aged in the bracket in which he would be eligible for merely the 30p, but it turned out, when we investigated, that he was not eligible, because he had been back to work for a very short period.
