	<p>[Sir STEPHEN MCADDEN in the Chair]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Stephen. In the OFFICIAL REPORT of this Committee's proceedings on Tuesday morning, 1st February, 1972, in column 1142, a paragraph in my speech has been repeated, and some words which I used have been omitted. Whilst I am fully aware that I talk nonsense on many occasions, I prefer to be responsible for my own nonsense. May the record be corrected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to tell the right hon. Gentleman that I have already drawn the attention of the OFFICIAL REPORT to this error, and it will be corrected. It is a case of double printing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brynmor John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. During the course of the last fortnight, draft proposals for the electoral divisions of the proposed Welsh authorities has been coming out. Those who are Welsh Members are able to read the details in the Press. However, none are supplied to hon. Members in this Committee or to any hon. Member whose constituency is affected. There is one copy placed in the Library, but if a copy needs to be taken, it involves a long and arduous process of photocopying. Since some hon. Members from English constituencies appear to have been supplied by the Home Office with these draft proposals, should not hon. Members in Wales whose constituencies are affected by the proposals receive the relevant one? Welsh Members in this Committee should be supplied with copies of each of the proposals so that they may give them due consideration before debating the Clauses relating to Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have an advantage which the English Members were denied, in that the draft proposals are coming out before we
	<span class='label label-info column'>1218</span>
consider the boundaries. Therefore, I hope that some instruction or direction can be given that they be supplied to Welsh Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Richard Sharples)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. I take note of what the hon. Gentleman says. I am sending a copy to every hon. Member. It is simply a matter of machinery, and I am distributing copies as fast as I possibly can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 43</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>RETURNING OFFICERS AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Having looked at the provisional selection of Amendments to Clause 43, could you tell us, Sir Stephen, what has been the fate of Amendment No. 642, in page 21, line 28, leave out from beginning to "and" in line 30 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"The returning officer for an election of councillor for the county council shall be the registration officer of the district council covering that electoral area"?</p></blockquote>
This Amendment has considerable authority support, if I may use that phrase, and it seems to have been left outâ€”unless you have not selected it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand it was taken on Tuesday with Amendment No. 641, and that is why it does not appear on the list today. It was withdrawn by the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you very much, Sir Stephen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now we get on with the Chairman's provisional selection of Amendments, which is on the table. Perhaps I should draw attention to the fact that the page numbers showing where the Amendments are to be found are not mentioned on the long list. A shorter list is also available on the table, from which hon. Gentlemen can trace the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first Amendment is Amendment No. 733, with which it will be convenient to discuss Amendment No. 734, in Clause 50, page 26, line 22, leave out from "it" to end of line 23.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0663">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1219</span>
	<p>Amendment No. 735, in page 27, line 16, leave out subsection (6).</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 725, in Clause 79, page 50, leave out lines 9 and 10.</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 726, in Clause 93, page 59, line 34, leave out paragraph (	<i>a</i>).</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 727, on page 67, line 32, leave out Clause 106.</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 720, in Clause 174, page 108, leave out lines 14 to 17.</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 721, in Clause 198, page 137, line 24, leave out "the Common Council".</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 722, in page 137, line 29, leave out "and the Common Council".</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 723, in Clause 207, page 140, line 29, leave out "or the Common Council of the City of London".</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 724, in Clause 248, page 176, leave out lines 26 and 27.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 733, in page 21, line 38, leave out from "held" to end of line 40.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Stephen. There does not seem to be a list of page numbers on the table.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a small sheet. I can see it from here on the table.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment and the consequential Amendments attempt to delete from the Bill references to the City of London with a view to removing this anomaly from local government. The Report of the Royal Commission on London Government makes it quite clear. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If we were to be strictly logical we should recommend the amalgamation of the City and Westminster."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to sayâ€”the hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed) may appreciate these wordsâ€”that
	<br><blockquote><p>"logic has its limits and the position of the City lies outside them."</p></blockquote>
That was the view of the Royal Commission on London Government. I hope that the Committee will agree this morning that we are trying in the Bill to ensure that we have a logical structure to local government throughout England and Wales, and we should ensure that this
	<span class='label label-info column'>1220</span>
remaining anomaly in the City of London is dealt with accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that the City of London must, for various reasons, be treated with respect by hon. Members. The City sustained the House in the 16th century, and at other times in constitutional disputes, but as a form of local government in this kingdom in the 20th century I do not feel that it should be tolerated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would only be fair to say that, as in some of my earlier excursions into Wiltshire, I cannot claim to have the full support of the local authority for this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Morrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As Wiltshire has made such an impression upon the hon. Member, I hope he will not forget it in his further discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's speech and that of his hon. Friend on that occasion made it quite clear that I should make an early visit to his county to carry my researches further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill as it stands will maintain the City of London with its antiquated and undemocratic government and also maintain the rather unfair influence which I shall show it can play over the government of other parts of London. The City's undemocratic form of government is being preserved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be worth refreshing the memory of the Committee with some details of the rather undemocratic structure of government in the City, because it does not fit in with the pattern and the structure of local government which we have been discussing for the rest of the country in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prime instrument of government in the City is the body known as the Court of Common Council, referred to time and again in the Bill and references to which are deleted in the consequential Amendments. On frequent occasions in the Bill the Court of Common Council is equated with the council of one of the London boroughs. The Bill provides in various places for things that can be done and certain powers exercised either by a London Borough Council or by the Common Council of the City of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Court of Common Council is a body not of the relatively modest size which Ministers have suggested is appropriate for the size of county councils or even district councils with populations up
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0664">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1221</span>
to 200,000. It is still a body consisting of 159 members. I understand that there are mumblings and grumblings in the City and suggestions that it should be reduced to 130 members, but it is considerably larger than any of the councils which we are proposing to set up under this Bill in the recommendations from the Home Office referred to earlier by my hon. Friends. The Minister and the Redcliffe-Maud Report were reluctant to see councils much larger than 60, 80 or 100 members. Here we have a population of 7,000 in the control of a council of 159 members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other anomaly is that while there are only 7,000 electors for parliamentary purposes in the City of London, when it comes to local government elections or elections for the Court of Common Council, there is a considerably inflated electorate consisting largely of businessmen, many of them fairly well-off, some very wealthy, who swamp the total residential population of the City. What is more serious is that in the situation where there are a large number of influential people and a small number of people who live in the area, instead of having a secret ballot where people can make their vote without it being seen, the procedure for elections for the Court of Common Council still follows the traditions of the ward mote, where initial election is by show of hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Michael Stewart) has pointed out the difficutlies that he found on one occasion when he attended a ward mote. On arrival, distinguished people told him, "Quick, put up your hand". Thinking that this was an instruction for something he had to do, he found himself voting for a councillor without knowing the name of the candidate. This system of ward motes is surely outdated in this day and age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even more extraordinary is the system by which one becomes a candidate for the Court of Common Council. As I understand it, even under the amendments in the City of London (Various Powers) Act, 1967, one can only become a candidate for the Court of Common Council if one is a freeman, either by inheritance or by purchase. It costs Â£3.15 to become a freeman, or Â£2.10 for members of livery companies, because in those cases it is assumed that they have paid enough to their livery company already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1222</span>
It seems monstrous to tell people that in order to exercise their democratic rights to stand as candidates for the council of a local government in this country, they must pay Â£3.15 before they can stand for election. In fact, however, the position is worse than this. Not only must one pay Â£3.15, but one's application to buy a free-manship in the City of London has to be approved by the Court of Common Council itself. So there is a situation where the existing councillors, by their power to veto applications for the purchase of free-manship, are able to decide who can or cannot be candidates to stand against them in an election. This power, given to the Court of Common Council, seems to me most undemocratic and to be another reason why the City, as it stands at the moment, should disappear. It could become a rural borough under the Clauses which we considered earlier but, in its present form, it is totally undemocratic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Court of Common Council is not alone. There is a two-tier, or perhaps a two-sphere, system of government in the City as eslewhere. There is also the court of aldermen, which includes the Lord Mayor and consists of 26 aldermen. There are 26 wards in the City and one would imagine that each ward would have one alderman. In fact, that is not the case. The wards of Cripplegate Within and Cripple-gate Without are combined, for the purpose of electing aldermen, into one ward. but to make up the 26 there is also an alderman who sits for the ward of Bridge Without. The ward of Bridge Without is so much "without" the City that it is not even in the City of London, but is in the London Borough of Southwark. Therefore, a special procedure has to be devised whereby an alderman from outside the City can be elected for this notional ward in order to make up the court of aldermen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned a little earlier the Lord Mayor, and here again we might assume that, as provided in this Bill, the Lord Mayor would be elected by the members of the Court of Common Council, perhaps together with the aldermen. But no; in the City there is yet another body, the Court of Common Hall, which is not elected at all, and which in turn elects the Lord Mayor. This council consists of the Liverymen of the City Companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to stray out of order on this Amendment, but I thought it was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0665">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1223</span>
important to give some indication of the rather curious system by which the City of London, a local government body which we are perpetuating by various references in this Bill, operates. It seems a very curious charade, and if it was only raising large sums for charity or holding dinners to entertain Cabinet Ministers or visiting royalty, we would not be too worried about it. There are some aspects of the City of London powers, as far as planning and education are concerned, where this totally undemocratic, unrepresentative body can play an important part in the government of the Greater London area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, in the papers this morning, there is reference to the fact that the City of London is deciding to construct a road running through the city, which in almost any other borough would be the responsibility of the Greater London Council. This is being done because if it were made a principal road, an area 220 feet on either side of it could be planned by the Greater London Council. The City of London, of course, does not wish the Greater London Council to start planning on a coherent overall basis the internal parts of the City of London. The City, therefore, using its great wealth, is building this road and going on with plans which are not in keeping wtih those of the rest of the Greater London area, creating distortions which may well be of a serious character. Because of its undemocratic nature and its great wealth, it canâ€”perhaps these are too strong wordsâ€”even cock a snook at the Greater London Council in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is the extraordinary anomaly as regards education. The Inner London Education Authority is one of the most important education authorities in this country. Its present constitution is such that one member is nominated by each London borough together with one member from the Court of Common Council. The London boroughs in the Inner London area have 200,000 or 300,000 people; the population of the City of London is only 7,000. As far as those nominated members are concerned, therefore, there is a totally unbalanced represenatation by population. It could be, in a situation where the political
	<span class='label label-info column'>1224</span>
power in the Inner London boroughs was closely divided, that this vote from the Court of Common Council could tilt the balance, and seriously and in an undemocratic way affect decisions about the whole pattern of education in the capital city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons I feel that the Committee should take advantage of the opportunity in this Bill to remove this illogical anomaly from our pattern of local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr, Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of these Amendments would not be to abolish local government of the City of London. That is established as part of the London government system by the London Government Act, 1963, the relevant parts of which are not affected by this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure the Committee is greatly indebted to the hon. Member for Farn-worth (Mr. Roper) for his fascinating explanation of the constitution and government of the City of London. The more he delved into the very interesting and ancient traditions, the more determined I became to resist his Amendments to destroy them. He said that it was an undemocratic form of governmentâ€”undemocratic, when there are 159 members elected by show of hands, representing 7,000 residents of the city and a mass of business interests throughout the City of London? It seems to me an exactly appropriate type of government for those who have both their homes and their important work within the city. Undemocratic, if the aldermen are elected? I thought that was what we were fighting about over London recently. Undemocratic, just because one has to be a freeman of the city in order to be a candidate for the Common Council? The freeman-ship of a city is held in great regard and treasured in many cities in the country, and it represents the loyalty of citizens to a city. In the City of London, the requirement that a candidate shall exhibit his loyalty by being a member of the guilds of London shows the freemen's great tradition, dating back for centuries, of declaring their loyalty to their area by the formalities through which they go to become freemen and be enrolled by the Lord Mayor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the hon. Member for Farnworth means this seriously
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0666">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1225</span>
or whether it is just a leg-pull for the Committee. I have tried to deal with it seriously in reply. I think this is a perfectly appropriate form of government for an area unique in the whole country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that the Minister put up a most remarkable defence to an extremely logical case. We are all agreed that the City of London is an anachronism. It was interesting that the Minister made no attempt whatever to depart from that proposition. Indeed, his justification is that this anachronism is so hallowed by time and tradition that it should be continued. One imagines that, as part of the tourist season, large numbers of people arrive from overseas, take in Buckingham Palace, the changing of the guard and the Tower of London, and automatically gravitate to Guildhall and the Cityâ€”the "Cheshire Cheese" and "Dirty Dick's" too. I am glad that I am carrying the Minister with me on a short Cook's tour of the capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be fair to the Minister, that is the only basis on which the establishment of the City of London can be justifiedâ€”that it is exceptionally provided for in the history and tradition of our local government service. It cannot be defended on any grounds of logic but, because so many British things cannot be defended, it had better be left as it is. I must make it clear that this is a serious Amendment. The sort of defence which has been outlined could not be embraced by any serious student of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had, for example, the remarkable statement of the Minister that the City of London has 159 members elected on a show of hands, and that they represent 7,000 residents and a mass of commercial and City institutions, and that this was evidence of democracy. At the very moment that the size of every large provincial city in the country is being cut down, 159 members to represent the City of London is something apparently that can be justified although it is in complete contradiction to everything else that he and his colleagues have said about the government of every other city in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister tells us that we have to hallow these traditions, because it is the City. We do not hallow these traditions when they are found in Plymouth, or when they are found in Birmingham, Manchester. Cardiff or anywhere else. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>1226</span>
cries of his own hon. Friends in those cities to leave things as they are, even to allow aldermen to be made, is a cry which we do not support. They support the abolition of aldermen in respect of these cities but apparently this anachronism is to continue in the City of London on the grounds that the aldermen are elected. That is a very interesting proposition. If aldermen can be defended if they are elected, one wonders what Government thinking was on the proposition that if aldermen are so important they might have been elected in the rest of the country. There might have been some system for the election of aldermen. Again, this would only have underlined the anachronism, if we sought to elect both aldermen and councillors throughout the country, and therefore this had to be defeated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, I find the Minister's comments about freemen for the City of Londonâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves the question of aldermen in the City, there is another undemocratic element about aldermen of the City of London. Once they have been elected they are, I think, elected for life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that, indeed, is true. If it is true, it only heightens the anomalies and inconsistencies, and the indefensibility of the system in London. That anybody could be elected to any public position for life is something, Sir Stephen, which you or I would like to think possible so far as we are concerned, but we have a much greater respect for democracy than to think this possible. In the City of London this is possible. All things seem to be possible in the City of London, whereas nothing is possible outside the City of London. This seems to be the philosophy of the Government in this respect.

Turning to the question of freemen, the Minister made some play of the fact that freemen of the City can be elected to the Court of Common Council, and he felt that a city can show no greater affection, or make no greater acknowledgement of the loyalty of a supporter or of a citizen than to elect him a freeman. I am not quite certain about this, but I think there are many freemen of the City of London whose association with the City is extremely tenuous. I will not put it any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0667">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1227</span>
higher than that. I have known one building trade worker in my own constituency who turned out to be a freeman of the City of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is wrong with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly delighted that a working class man like that became a freeman of the City. He served all his life on the Birmingham City Council and gave great distinction to our city. But it convinced me that this was not so much a reward for service as some title to be bestowed upon people as the City thinks fit. If that is the case, it hardly seems to coincide with the explanation given by the Minister, as to the traditional reasons why most of our cities make freemen. In most of our cities the honorary freedom is very generously given. It is not given lightly or in large numbers or as part of a package deal, as I think my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. George Thomas), who is a freeman, would agree. He earned it by his great loyalty and devotion, and he would certainly not wish to see the value of his freedom devalued by the wholesale distribution of such an honour, such as seems to be going on in the City of London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend and the other freemen of ancient cities throughout the country do not have the extraordinary privileges of freemen of the City of London, of being able to vote on the election of aldermen and on other important matters. The freedom of our cities, which is graciously given and is no doubt extremely well earned and deserved by the recipients, is a great honour, but it is not an honour which is given in order to undermine the democratic processes of our city government. The Minister has no logical case to defend the proposition. He resorts to the hallowed case that it is time-honoured by tradition, that it is indefensible in logic, but that it had better stay as it is, mainly because our friends and financial supporters like it that way, and nothing should be done to cause them any distress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true, as the Minister said, that if we pass the Amendment, in so doing, we do not cancel out the London Government Act, 1963. This would require to be amended or repealed in order to abolish the City of London. By pressing the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1228</span>
Amendment to a Division we can register the belief of hon. Gentlemen on this side of the Committee that the City of London, whilst it has many traditional values which we admire, is an anachronism in terms of the democratic conduct of local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment is a piece of mischievous meddling nonsense. It is based, as are so many of the arguments of hon. Gentlemen opposite, not on an understanding of the situation but on envy of something they do not understand. Furthermore, it is based, not on objections to the system, but on objections to certain people who happen to benefit by the system. This was given away by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) who gives away so much in his speeches, when he referred to the people who supported the Tory Party and all that rubbish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So often during the proceedings of this Committee hon. Gentlemen opposite have displayed a lack of a sense of history. No one could accuse me of inconsistency in my defence, during these proceedings, of local traditions and local values. This is not the London Government Bill. This Bill is not designed to reform the structure of local government. As I said the other day, I should have preferred all reference to London to be deleted from the Bill. It would be absolute nonsense to delay further on this mischievous and meddling Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very surprised at the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack).

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was my privilege, too, to be a history master, but not in Cardiff, I am afraid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot have everything. He is young yet. He may be glad of such a post again. He has a mining seat.

The hon. Gentleman touched me on the raw when he said that we had no sense of historyâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would never include the hon. Gentleman in that accusation. I am sorry if the blanket covered him. He

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much obliged, but I do not want my speech spoiled. I want him to include me for the moment. I want to make it quite clear that the great traditions, of which our people are so proud, are part of our history, just as they are part of the history of the party opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our history is one of fighting against the entrenchment of privilege for the few. Our history is of making possible the advancement of real democracy in these islands. No step towards real democracy has been made without opposition from the party opposite. They have never changed, and I believe they never will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I deplore too frequent interruptions. I am trying to follow the right hon. Gentleman's speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is such a good speech, Sir Stephen, and the right hon. Gentleman is such a good historian that one must remind him that the Reform Bill of 1867 was not exactly passed by the hon. Gentlemen opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know where the hon. Gentleman was teaching history, but if he would look at the book again he would find that there was no Labour Party at that time. We came in at the turn of this century and democracy made great strides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evelyn King</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also have been a history master. I must refer the right hon. Gentleman to what he actually said. He said nothing about the Labour Party; he said that no Tory Government had introduced a democratic Measure. If he casts his historical scholarship and accuracy back to the year 1867, he will wish to withdraw that statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not a history master but I am the Chairman of the Committee and the debate is getting very wide of the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply grateful for your protection, Sir Stephen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1972 there is something ridiculous, if not obscene, in wanting to cling to the privileges of an old form of society that belongs to the history book. It is absurd that the City of London should have privileges that are denied to the burgesses
	<span class='label label-info column'>1230</span>
in the rest of the country. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) was kind enough to refer to the fact that I am a freeman of the Borough of the Rhondda. I am a son of the Rhondda and I am more proud of having the freedom of that mining valley than I was to hold the office of Secretary of State for Wales, and I was very proud of that. Any Welshman would be proud to hold that office. But to have the freedom of one's home is something beyond expression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should the freedom, which is the ultimate accolade that one's community can give, have one meaning in one part of the country and special privileges for those who are rich enough to be in this favoured group of the City of London?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A bricklayer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And a rich one too, was he not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to say that my friend is no longer with us on this earth and, therefore, he is rich indeed. In the years when he was a loyal constituent of mine, he was the national President of the Plasterers' Union and served the trade union movement with great distinction, but not with great wealth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has received the freedom of another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing of envy in this. I do not know the people concerned. I am not envious of any man's receiving such honours as may come to him in life. Life has been very good to me. In politics there is no purpose in being envious of people but, equally, politics are nothing unless we remain true to the principles which are part of our very being.

This morning we are revealing the gulf that divides us, the party of the democrats, from the party of patronage and privilege. My hon. Friend, in moving an Amendment which might not have been thought by some hon. Gentlemen and right hon. Gentlemen opposite to be a matter of great moment, is hoisting a flag of principle for the Labour movement in this country. We believe that the tide of democracy cannot be held back in these islands, where all are treated alike. That is a lesson which hon. and right hon. Gentlemen will have to learn and had better bear in mind when considering this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0669">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1231</span>
question of the City of London this morning. The Committee knows that I come from the Principality of Wales but, whether we come from Scotland, Ireland or Wales, all of us in these islands have a special pride in London and the part that it plays in our history. We should like to see London the most democratic city in the world, and that it cannot be unless the Amendment is accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that every member of the Committee would rather be a freeman of the Rhonddas than of the City of London, given the points made by my right hon. Friend. I was very disappointed to hear the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) say that the points which the Opposition have put this morning were meddling and mischievous. Like my hon. Friends, I feel that a great matter of principle is at issue. If nothing else comes out of the Committee today, surely we could say that our hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) gave us a speech which was not only astonishing in what it revealed but was also first-rate and made many of us on this side of the Committee realise for the first time the anachronisms which exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was amazed to hear of ward motes, of elections, of freemen by inheritance and by purchase. One would think that in the memory of Lord Morrison of Lambeth, the continued existence of the City of London is something of a slur. It is amazing to hear of vetoes on applications for the office of freemen; I felt myself that it was a tale of privilege, a recitation of mediaeval mumbo-jumbo and bric Ã  brac, that in the heart of the greatest city in the world we have some mediaeval nonsense, well ready for obliteration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth mentioned the abilities of the City of London concerning education and planning. I should have thought that in this part of the 20th century this was a blot on the development and existence of local government with its proud reputation. When I think of the City of London now, I am not unaware of the annual Lord Mayor's Show, the gilded coaches and the liveried flunkeys. These, in a way, are offensive and grotesque. In my opinion, they should not be allowed to co-exist with all that is good in our local government system in the Principality, in Scotland, and England as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1232</span>
I reject the hon. Member's assertion that this is mischievous, meddling nonsense. I think it is the righteous indignation of social democrats who want things changed, who want to do things for the good of the ordinary people of this country. We should not want to retain these remnants of the oligarchic orders of yesteryear. The reason why our country has great problems today is that we look back too much and not forward enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Committee can see its way to support entirely what my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth has so interestingly and effectively put forward today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must spring to the defence of the motes. Hon. Gentlemen opposite are anxious to eliminate them. Personally I should like to see their elevation to greater political influence. It is surely unfair to say that the ward motes are undemocratic. They are truly democratic in the old Athenian sense, in that voting is by show of hands. The right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) quoted with approval the Greek democratic practices, and this is a Greek democratic practice at its best. I believe there are still two cantons in Switzerland that conduct their election in this way, whereby the eligible voters come together once a yearâ€”or more frequently for referendaâ€”and vote on decisions by show of hands. In a small community of 7,000 electors, this is surely not an undemocratic way of election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The parliamentary electorate is 7,000 but the local government electorate is very much greater than that because of all the business votes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that point, because it demonstrates the uniqueness of the City of London. With 7,000 residents and a business population so vast that several hundred thousand people, at least, come into the square mile itself every day of the working week, that is something unique in the British Isles, and there is a good case for having a unique system of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen with a sense of sadness the Bill deprive many of our ancient cities and boroughs of traditions that I think hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would have liked to see retained, if only for traditional functions. But the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0670">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1233</span>
City can be retained; it is not necessary, in a great reform of local government, to bring the City within the scope of such a reform. The status of other cities could not be retained without wrecking the principle of reform, but the City of London can be retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was concerned when the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) suggested that it could be reduced to the level of a rural borough. That would presumably mean that the Lord Mayor would lose his title and become the chairman; and in that case one could not imagine the City of London being the tourist attraction that it is. Even the right hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. George Thomas) said that the whole country has a special pride in London. He is right; the world has a special interest in London and its traditions. It would hardly be the same if the Lord Mayor were called chairman of the council. One would have the Chairman's Show once a year. It would not have quite the same ring if the cry had gone out "Turn again, Whittington, Chairman of the Greater London Authority."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These things are worth preserving, not just for the sake of London itself, because there is little benefit from the entrenched privileges of this City Council. One gathers that it costs those who participate in it a great deal of money; there is little financial advantage accruing to them as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that we shall continue to recognise the unique position of the City of London in the light of the history of Britain, and also as one of the great traditions of the world. We should be doing a great disservice if we used the Bill to destroy something of which, I think, secretly every hon. Member opposite and on this side is very proud indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like first of all to deal with one curious part of the Minister's speechâ€”that any discussion on the City of London, when we are discussing the reorganisation of local government in 1972, must be either a leg-pull or inappropriate. The hon. Gentleman uses London as an illusionist uses his rabbitâ€”"now you see it, now you don't". If we move an Amendment concerned with London, we are wrong and out of order; the rabbit has disappeared into the hat.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1234</span>
But the Minister is perfectly prepared to put into the Bill page after pageâ€”if he will excuse the use of that wordâ€”and Clause after Clause, that concerns London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take his point that the Amendment may well not achieve the effect that my hon. Friends and I would like, but as I have repeated to the extent of boring the Committee to tears, we are not paid to draft the hon. Gentleman's work for him. There are people perfectly capable of doing that much better than we can. The Minister was well aware of what we were after, because he said so, but that was perhaps a 	<i>proforma</i> point. When he asks whether this a leg-pull, let us be perfectly clear about it. On the Opposition side we have always been in favour of the abolition of the City of London as it now is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised the Minister has forgotten that the London Government Act acquired a certain amount of interest and notoriety from Members on both sides of the House. At that time my right hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Michael Stewart) made what I have always thought was a very remarkable speech and a promise that the day would come when a Labour Government would abolish the City of London. As far as I know, nobody accused him of indulging in a leg-pull. Indeed, some of us wondered whether my right hon. Friend the Member for Fulham ever would indulge in a leg-pull. Certainly you would grant, Sir Stephen, that I am incapable of a leg-pull. This is a very serious Amendment because it is designed, first of all, to achieve what we know it will not achieve because it will be voted down 	<i>en masse</i> without thought by hon. Members opposite. Secondly, it will show one day what ought to be done, and it will show clearly to ordinary people everywhere where the real difference lies when it comes to a last ditch assertion of ancient but undemocratic rights. There is a clear division between the parties; we know there is. Why is there?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister tries to tell us that the City of London is governed in a democratic fashion, one notes the anger in his voiceâ€”"Undemocratic?" he says; "it cannot be. Good heavens, freemen by purchase, freemen by inheritance; this must be a democratic system." he says. "It is an honourable title, freeman." Indeed, it is. We are not talking about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0671">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1235</span>
that. We are talking about power and how power is operated. It is as simple as that. Is power really operated at the behest and by the right of the ordinary voters of this country, or is it operated in a different form altogether?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of us, on both sides, accept that so far as the City of London is concerned, it is operated in a different manner. I have frequently remarked on the common sense of the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), but I must take him a little to task on his memory, because I was not commending the Attic system of democracy except in Athens at that time. I mentioned the point in answer to a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) and I said that, alas, it would not work in a modern industrial society and nor will it. Even if it really were a democratic and a practicable method of democracy to have a show of hands in electing one's councillors, these are not democratic councillors; these are not the normal democratic candidates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman supports voting by a show of hands among trade unionists, with all the consequences that that brings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was, I thought, dealing with local government, but I am perfectly willing, if the hon. Gentleman likes, outside, to discuss the trade unions. I do not think if I were now to discuss the trade unions, you would approve, Sir Stephen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly would not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So this is the situation. We all accept, on both sides of the Committee, that this is not a democratic method of using powers. The Minister's synthetic indignation we all took with a large pinch of salt. He himself does not feel it either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is to my mind, first, an absolutely vital reason that this system should not be continued, and secondly, an alternative which seems to me to meet most of the points of hon. Gentlemen opposite and all the points made by my hon. Friends on this side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, how many of the so-called elected representatives in the City of London actually live in the City of London? I agree that there is a division between the two parties on this. The party oppo-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1236</span>
site says that one has just as much interest in one's local authority if one works there as if one lives there. We take a contrary view on this side of the Committee, but they are both respectable arguments and one comes to a difference of opinion. In how many councils in this country, however, does nobody live in the area which he represents? Even the Minister will say that if one works in the area one should be a councillor, but does he wish to exclude the people who actually live there? In how many local authorities do the majority of the electors not live in the area? This is why this anachronism sticks out like a sore thumb and should be abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to return to the other point, as it seems that two arguments have been inextricably linked up. There is the question of democracy and powers: my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth, in a fascinating speech, gave us some examples of those very important powersâ€”planning and education, and he might have added police. That these powers should be democratically exercised is the purpose of local government. This Bill is not about local government alone; it is about local democracy as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the point about the traditions, and I personally find them very amusing and would want to keep themâ€”Lord Mayors and coaches, the Worshipful Company of Fanmakersâ€”although I do not suppose any of them have made a fan in 150 yearsâ€”or Fishmongers or Gardeners and all the other rather curiously-named chaps who exist in companies in the City of London. I want to keep all the tittivalatium, because I find it amusing and interesting, and no doubt it will bring foreign currency in the way of tourism.â€”[An hon. Member: "And irrelevant."] No, it is not irrelevant. It is just irrelevant to local government. There is no reason why all this should not go on as a fairytale charade, but be divorced totally from local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If tomorrow we were to abolish the local government powers of the City of London, does anyone imagine that suddenly the Lord Mayor's procession and the Lord Mayor's coach would come to an end, or that suddenly the amount of turtle soup digested in the City of London would fall drastically, that the Prime Minister would not be able to give his words of wisdom as November comes in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0672">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1237</span>
the City of London, that visiting monarchs would never be seen again in the City of London? Of course, this would not happen. We all know that those traditions of the City of London cost the people of this country, in actual money, very little. It is the individuals who like to see themselves dress up and take a part in this fairy-tale who mainly provide the money. Incidentally, I wonder why it is that when grown men want to make a show, they dress up as women? There must be some psychological reason that I do not understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that we ought to pursue this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a bit of a drag.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that you are wise, Sir Stephen. I shall not carry on with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is a show, and it ought to be preserved, but it has nothing to do with the police; it has nothing to do with education, or with planning, or with those appalling monstrosities, the high buildings, that have been put up in the City of London and take away the light. Those ought to be administered properly and democratically, and they could be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully understand the reasons why the Minister does not want to accept the Amendments. Perhaps his best reason was the first. I said that he was an illusionist, that perhaps this Bill is not the place to carry out the abolition of the City of London. As my right hon. Friend said, it is a place, and a just place, for a flag to be hoisted. Nine years ago my right hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Michael Stewart) last raised the point. The hon. Gentleman was learning history then, not teaching it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of fact, I was teaching it then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of fact, I am still learning it. At any rate, it was nine years agoâ€”a long time agoâ€”and it is right that the matter should be raised again. It is right that not only our generation of parliamentarians should be aware of where the Labour Party stands on this, but we should also be aware of where the Conservative Party stands on it. One day there will be a Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1238</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State does not believe that there will ever be anything other than a Conservative Government? I begin to believe the rumours about the Minister of State. It will come. When the abolition of the City of London comesâ€”as it will thenâ€”it will be done in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not support those of my hon. Friends who dislike all the traditions. I find them quaint, amusing and, above all, dollar-earning. I want to keep that part of it. If we can separate them, as I believe they can, then we will have the best of both worlds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, my hon. Friend ought to say what he feels about the various arguments put by the other side. I and most of my hon. Friends will support my hon. Friend if he presses the Amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend did deal with freemen. In other parts of the country this Bill gets rid of the freemen in some of our cities who still retain certain powers. Why should we not also get rid of comparable powers in the City of London?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will interject at once. I should not wish it thought that a Clause later in the Bill, which looks as if it destroys freemen in the rest of the country, is not receiving full consideration. We are in consultation on this matter and I may introduce Amendments to it later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I had been aware of that, my speech would have been twice as long, and that would have been a tragedy both for you, Sir Stephen, and for my reputation for reasonable brevity.

Whether the Minister has second thoughts about late Amendments, this is an anomalous position that ought to be changed. It is anomalous because it is not democratic, and it is democracy that we are talking about. To that extent, I agree absolutely with everything my hon. Friend has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to pursue that point very shortly. I discover that freemen in the rest of the country have no local government functions. I wish to retain their dignities and the benefits which they receive from property held in trust for them. That is all I meant. We are looking at it from that point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0673">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1239</span>
different matters. Honorary freemen is one matter, and we understand that they will be retained, or some efforts made to do so, but there are other casesâ€”including Newcastle, where I liveâ€”where freemen have certain powers and control over and possession of important property. This is a different matter altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. That is relevant to what we were saying about the Common Council of the City. The Common Council is the only case in which freemen exercise a local government function, in that they have to be freemen of the City before they can stand as candidates for local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not found this anywhere else in the country. In the rest of the country the freemen are entitled, as beneficiaries, to some property held in trust for them. That is so in Newcastle. I spent a very interesting afternoon with a freeman of Newcastle, in company with the President of the Freemen of England and a few others, and I learned a tremendous amount about this. In the rest of the country, apart from the City of London, I am convinced that they do not exercise a local government function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) said that this Bill is not the place to abolish the City of London. Indeed, I rest my case on that. Perhaps there never will be such a place, but it is not this Bill. I accept the sincerity of the speeches made and, if anyone wishes me to do so, I will withdraw the phrase "leg-pull" because, undoubtedly, speeches have been made with sincerity and a belief in principle behind them. I myself do not share that belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the intention of the Amendments was to abolish this form of local government in a certain area of the country, the City of London. I am surprised, if this is the official Opposition position and feeling is so strong on it, that this Amendment appeared at the eleventh hour before reaching the appropriate Clause, and that it was put on the Order Paper by the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must accept, since he acknowledges sincerity, and since we both accept that this is not the right place, that it is a little difficult to frame the Bill so that the correct Amend-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1240</span>
ment can be put in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was really making an excuse for myself. Had I had an opportunity of briefing myself fully on the defence of the City of London, my words would not have been so stumbling. Perhaps I could have chosen my words better. They are stumbling because of my sincerity in the belief that this is the right form of local government for the City.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not seek to change either the structure of London government, the distribution of functions between the London authorities, or the present constitution or electoral arrangements of the London authorities in order to bring them into line with the rest of the country. This is not the intention of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister agree that Clauses 174 and 198 would change the functions of the City of London very much along the sort of lines that my right hon. Friend said?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Where, of necessity, we have had to bring in from the general law of local government certain statutory provisions which apply also to London, we have had to mention London in the Bill. This is not a Bill to alter the structure of London government. That had very thorough parliamentary debate leading up to the London Government Act, 1963. At least 50 per cent. of my case in opposing the Amendment, is that this is not the right vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Deptford said that the power was vested in the wrong hands as a result of the electoral arrangements for the Common Council. He made the extremely interesting point that the pomp and ceremony was not necessarily joined with the power and could be separated. This is worth remembering. Perhaps I shall come to this when we deal with other parts of the Bill in trying to retain the dignities of boroughs in the rest of the country. We can think of the pomp and ceremony which people treasureâ€”and I do not say "pomp and ceremony" in a derogatory way; I value itâ€”and perhaps divorce it from local government functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is relevant in this connection, particularly with the City of London, to bear in mind the sort of local government functions which we would wish those who govern such a unique area such as the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0674">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1241</span>
square mile of the City of London to exercise. I would be prepared to argue that the structure of their local government is right for the kind of function which they have to exercise. I have no doubt that we shall come back to this, perhaps even in the lifetime of this Parliament, but at this stage I resist the Amendment because this is not the right vehicle for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard from the Minister the same old, tired excuse which was trotted out about aldermen and on almost every other Amendment: "There is a vehicle, but not now â€¦" We are now discussing local government. I hope that this amendment will be pressed because my hon. Friend will have a great deal of support on this side, if not on the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard an astonishing speech from the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate). We all remember having trudged through the lobbies night after night on the Industrial Relations Act. The hon. Member extols the virtue of public vote. On industrial relations his party, and spokesmen of his party throughout the country, have been going around very indignantly saying, "You can't expect a genuine expression of view in public by these strikers. They are all guided and swayed by one another. So let us have the secret ballot; let us have the whole panoply of the law brought into industrial relations." Now, in connection with the City of London, he says that people are not influenced by each other in a public meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is pursuing the analogy of the Industrial Relations Act, could we then find out from him whether he is in favour of a secret ballot?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I thought that we were getting into troubled territory when the hon. Gentleman embarked upon this subject. We do not want to discuss the forms of ballot or voting in the Industrial Relations Act. We are discussing local government, and I think that we should stick to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that I would say in passing is that the miners, who are so vilified on the other side of the Committee, have had a secret ballot for years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to abolish ward motes;
	<span class='label label-info column'>1242</span>
we want to demote them. [	<i>Laughter</i>]. I must say the same thought occurred to me in regard to this Committee, after the last speech of the hon. Member for Faversham. If the choice were merely a spectacle where we had to choose between taking our children to the pantomine or to the Lord Mayor's Show, perhaps it would not be so important. I can understand my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) saying that local government functions can be divorced from the pomp and the spectacle. To me, the acceptance of the pomp and spectacle and aura of privilege which surrounds it is anathema. Those of us who are egalitarian in our outlook must view it with similar distaste.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was really talking about statutory pomp, not what one might call private pomp. After all, no-one really objects to the Ancient Order of Foresters or Elks, and if the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers wants to turn themselves into latter-day Elks, I am all for them doing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never seen a fishy elk, but I accept that this may be so. I accept that, if the noble Lord, Lord Robens, had his way and turned the country into Great Britain Incorporated the City of London Show could have been rather like the fifth touring company of "The Desert Song". However, it represents an establishment in this country. The acceptance of an establishment and the privilege which is automatically conferred upon it makes nonsense of the uniformity which we seek to impose on our democratic institutions in other parts of our country, and makes nonsense of the efforts we are making to bring various spheres of activity which impinge upon society within the ambit of democratic control. That is the point and this is the answer to the Minister when he says that this is not the vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Local Government Bill is anything, it is an attempt to extend democratic control to all relevant social activity. If it cannot be extended to this one Ruri-tanian enclave that will make nonsense of the work of this Committee. Therefore, I hope that we will reject the City of London's privileged position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and hon. Members opposite say that freemen are voters and so on. Again I would remind the Minister of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0675">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1243</span>
State, Home Office that the Local Government (Qualification of Councillors) Act did not give non-resident businessmen the vote again, but only enabled them to stand. Here, the freemen will be able both to stand and to vote. This is quite an anomalous position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we, as a country, believe in democracy, if we as a Committee believe that that democracy should be extended to take account of the changing pattern of local government, we should take account of the fact that, in the nine years which have passed since the London Government Act, more and more of our countrymen, particularly in the younger age group, have come to believe that this pomp and ceremonial nonsense is no longer relevant to the Britain of the last part of the twentieth century. I hope that we will argue in favour of equality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Faversham said that the Lord Mayor of London would be reduced to Chairman of the Council; 99.99 per cent. of us are glad to live within that sort of system, and for him to denigrate it in that way is an insult to chairmen of councils and to the various men, many of them in straitened circumstances, who, because of a belief in public service, voluntarily take on that job. That is an insult to themâ€”[An hon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Member: "Rubbish."] The hon. Gentleman is again commenting on his own contribution, which is not relevant to my speech.</p>
	<p>We are glad to live within a system where the electorate are able to choose the man who ultimately becomes the civic dignitary for their area. I believe that what is good enough for the rest of the country is good enough for the capital city of this country, and therefore I hope that this Amendment will be approved.</p>

I hope that the speeches of my right hon. and hon. Friends convinced him. We on this side of the Committee are very concerned about the position of the City of London, and I believe that this group of Amendments, although there may be some technical deficiency, establishes an important principle. I hope, therefore, in view of the support which has been shown by my right hon. and hon. Friends, and in view of the rather inadequate defence of the indefensible by the Minister, that we shall press this Amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can deal with the Amendment very briefly. I hope that all I need to do is to congratulate the Government on putting down Amendment No. 647, which seems to cover the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proportion of contested parish council elections increases every year and in due course, no doubt, all, or nearly all,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0676">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1245</span>
such elections will be contested. There will be times, therefore, when the pressure of these simultaneous elections will be substantial. The returning officer ought not, therefore, to be restricted to one deputy recruited exclusively from his own authority. That is the reason for the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Amendment No. 647, which the Government have put down, meets his point. I am grateful to him for drawing it to our attention. Amendment No. 647 puts it more briefly. Perhaps my hon. Friend will withdraw his Amendment No. 444 and allow the Committee to accept Amendment No. 647.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The interchange between the hon. Member and the Minister of State is interesting. We may agree with them, but we should like a little more information. It raises an important point on the practicality of elections. In some counties, there will be up to 80 electoral divisions. The Bill does not deal with that administrative problem. As I have said before in the Committee, it is more than an administrative problem in terms of the conduct of elections. The London Government Act lays down that the proper officer for both the G.L.C. and the London borough elections is an officer of that borough. Some of my advisers wonder why that principle cannot apply to other counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had representations from the A.M.C. on this point, as, I assume, the Government have. They attach great importance to Amendment No. 444, which is why I raised it as a point of order, Sir Stephen. They say that all electoral registration functions will be carried out in practice by district council officers. The district council staff will be the staff with the greater experience of the electoral divisions, drawing up the register and the conduct of elections. They will, in most cases, have had more experience than the county council staff of conducting elections, but the Clause requires the deputy returning officer at county council elections to be appointed from staff of the county council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will Amendment No. 647, which the Minister of State is urging us to accept, mean that the returning officers in these
	<span class='label label-info column'>1246</span>
cases will continue to be drawn from the staff of the county council, or will they be drawn from the staff of the district council, the council that has traditionally had responsibility?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a county election the county will appoint the returning officer. I think that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) was referring in part to Amendment No. 642, which we have already discussed. This was the subject of discussion between the A.M.C. and the other bodies representing local authorities, and the C.C.A. asked for the solution which we have put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of Amendment No. 647 is to give the greatest possible flexibility to the returning officer to appoint deputies. He will be able to appoint district officers as his deputies and he almost certainly will do. One has to take this in conjunction with the discussion on Amendment No. 642 which, without Amendment No. 647, would have placed an undue rigidity upon the returning officer. As the hon. Member rightly says, there will be a large number of divisions in order to give the greatest possible flexibility to the returning officer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not at all happy with the Minister's explanation. I can understand his telling us that the C.C.A. is happy with these proposals. I should be happier myself if he could have told us that the A.M.C. was happy with them. What he has done here, however, is to say that the county councils should control the situation, not only in respect of county elections, but in respect of district elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a proposition, if one takes into account the administrative size of the problem. The advice that I have had from political quarters is that in some of our counties there could be up to 80 electoral districts. In those circumstances, it would be wrong for the county council to appoint the returning officers for all those districts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a certain misunderstanding. If the hon. Gentleman reads subsection (1) he will see that it provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every county council shall appoint an officer of the council to be the returning officer for elections of councillors of the county and every district council shall appoint an officer
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0677">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1247</span>
of the council to be the returning officer for the elections of the district."</p></blockquote>
That probably makes the position clear. I think that we are arguing on a point that is not relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are arguing on an irrelevant point I am rather pleased, because it means that my concern is to some extent abated. However, since I received this letter from the Association of Municipal Corporations only this morning I have not had time to talk it over with the Association, and I am not sure whether its concern is abated in the way that the Minister has indicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not resist the Amendment. I know that it is difficult for Ministers and Members of the Opposition to be totally seized of the complications of a technical point of this sort, but when it is raised with us it clearly suggests concern by the appropriate authorities, and no doubt the Minister could undertake to continue discussions, through his officials, with the A.M.C. I shall be happy if I can be sure that if the A.M.C. finds anything which I have missed, or which I have misunderstood, it will be able to pursue the point with the Minister through the normal discussions between the Government and the local authority association. If the Minister is happy with that, I am quite happy to leave it with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the returning officer may appoint one or more personsâ€”that the returning officer mentioned in the Clause could appoint another officer of the council, or a member of the council, or someone who is not connected at all with the council, to act as his deputy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. This situation is likely to arise mainly in parish council elections. Normally the chief officer of the county council concerned will be the returning officer in county council elections. In districts, the district council appoints the returning officer. The real issue arises in parish council elections. There we feel it is right to provide a fairly wide degree of flexibility. An official will always be appointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see any point in laying this down too rigidly. As the hon. Gentleman said, in a single county one may be deal-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1248</span>
ing with a large number of elections when parish council elections take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then I am right in saying that nothing will prevent the returning officer from bringing in any personâ€”with or without a connection with the councilâ€”to act as his deputy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Goronwy Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I emphasise that the point of view expressed by my hon. Friend is fairly generally held at all levels of local government. From time to time, especially in rural areas, the official who would seem to be the obvious choice is either not available or not quite suitable. In these cases difficulty has been experienced on the question of authority to appoint another person to fulfil that role. The Minister of State's explanation satisfies my hon. Friend and the rest of us that at all levels there is authority for the appointment of anybody who is judged to be the most suitable for county, district or parish work. That is an open-ended availability to returning officers. Anybody can be appointed, whether or not he holds an official position. I am very glad to have that assurance because, like my hon. Friend, I have come across cases where difficulty has arisen in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with the question of the appointment of deputy returning officers, where no returning officer is appointed by the county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join in the advocacy from the other side of the Committee that where a county clerk is responsible for the appointment of a deputy returning officer, in the case of an election of a councillor to a district council it is a happy arrangement if the deputy returning officer appointed comes from the area of the district council in which the election is being held. It is courteous, for one thing. It is an arrangement that has all the merits that we require for a determination to be made within the wording of the Bill, without necessarily leaving it open to the county council clerk who will be responsible for the appointment. It would be a happier arrangement if the appointment of a deputy returning officer within the area of the district council were required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 620, in page 22, line 25, after "Act", insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"including in particular Rule 29 relating to the issue of official poll cards, but otherwise".</p></blockquote>
I have read out those words, rather than merely saying, "insert the words on the Order Paper", because the Amendment simply makes mandatory the provision of poll cards at local government elections as well as parliamentary elections. If the Amendment is accepted it will be the first time in our history that poll cards have been issued free over the whole country in local elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision that we shall have to make on this Amendment is an interesting one. There have been arguments for and against it. I want to tell the Committee a little about those arguments, because this is a matter of judgment, and in the end our decision must relate to the question whether we think that local democracyâ€”I am sorry to keep pressing those two words, but they seem most importantâ€”is better served by a free system of poll cards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major argument against the issue of free poll cards at local elections is that the danger arises that those who wish to engage in political activity during those electionsâ€”obviously the political parties, but independents as wellâ€”may be so coddled by the process of having their poll cards sent out for them that our practice of trying to energise the electorate at the time of an election will lose something in the process. There is something in this suggestion; I would not deny it. The more that central Government or local authority pays forâ€”and the less the political parties have to pay for and the less work they have to doâ€”the less likely it is, certainly in local elections, that the electorate will be energised and activated
	<span class='label label-info column'>1250</span>
into thinking seriously about the issues involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second argument that has been put forward can also be taken both ways, namely, that the issue of free poll cards would tend to make for the growth of many small minority partiesâ€”perhaps lunatic fringe partiesâ€”for independents, crackpots, and general eccentrics. It seems a rather unattractive argument, particularly as this Committee consists of two large political parties, and remembering the responsibility that we have to minorities as well as to ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the main argument in favour of the Amendment. We are dealing with large areas and distances. The more we can make our ordinary electors aware that an election is on, the better it is for local democracy. I emphasise "local democracy" because, as we said earlier, we accept Pope's words:

But we are concerned that ordinary people should be made aware that they have democratic rights in local government and should take advantage of them. In the many Sittings of this Committee we have occasionally found ourselves agreeing that not too many of our fellow citizens are aware of local government elections or willing to take their part in local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and I seem to share the view that anything we can do to awaken an interest is wholly for the good of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are therefore bound to appreciate and to weigh heavily, the argument that the issue of poll cards would enable electors all over the country to know that an election was about to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter was last discussed in the Home Office in 1963 at the Conference on Local Government Elections Law. It is interesting to note that at that conference were representatives of local authority associations, officers, and probably all the political parties, and that the majority were against the idea of poll cards, although they said that if there were to be poll cards, 1963 was not the year to issue them and that we should wait for a reorganisation of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That reorganisation is coming now, and the second part of the argument against poll cards therefore falls to the ground.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0679">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1251</span>
Considering all its implications, I wonder whether the greater part of the opinion was not simply because local government was not then being reorganised; I can appreciate that in a static local government situation, the sudden introduction of poll cards might have created the most appalling administrative difficulties to local government officersâ€”and the political parties might not have been so keen on it, either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everything is now going into the melting pot anyway. We are considering an entirely new system, starting, as it were, from Year One. What might have been a strong argument in 1963 has lost some of its force as the years have gone by; indeed, we now have to face rather stronger arguments in favour of poll cards than we had then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cheshire has been able to experiment, and the Home Secretary of the day encouraged the experiment. Cheshire issued poll cards. My hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) knows a good deal more about Cheshire than I shall ever know, and I hope that he will give us some information on the way in which the experiment has gone. I believe that it has shown that a larger proportion of the electorate seemed to vote continuously in Cheshire elections than across the border in Lancashire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the arguments in favour of poll cards. An argument against might be to ask, "Where is the line drawn"; if poll cards are to be supplied, why should the system not be extended until the whole of the democratic apparatus is paid for by the State, so that the State issues election addresses for the parties, runs the newspapers, and so on, or we end up with the West German system under which huge State grants are made to the political parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a profitable line of argument against a very small reform but worthwhile reform. It has proved its point, and now, after nine or 10 years' consideration, we ought to move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Edmund Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the major difficulties of operating mass democracy in modern society arises in terms of communication between the individual elector and the authorities concerned or, in an election, the candi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1252</span>
dates. We are all aware of the difficulties facing parliamentary candidates. We are also aware that at those times some advantages are not enjoyed in local government elections. At the time of a General Election a great deal of information is to be found in newspapers and other mass media concerning the holding of the election and the presentation of the viewpoints of different parties and candidates. That is much less prevalent at the time of local government elections, especially when polling is held on different days throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another advantage of a parliamentary election is the free post, which is available to candidates for distributing litera-tuency. I have always felt that ture to all the electors in their consti-communication between a candidate and individual electors was the most important part of any election campaignâ€”more important than advertisements in newspapers or the holding of public meetingsâ€”because, above everything else, it was a personal link with the electors. It also ensured that electors knew that an election was being held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my experience of helping at local government elections in scattered rural areas, I have come across the difficulties that face candidates in the absence of advertisements and information through the mass media, and the free post. I recollect helping in a county council by-election held in the middle of winter in a rural division of Lincolnshire. The parishes concerned were scattered over a far-flung marshland area, and the only way in which one could be sure that electors were informed that an election was to take place was by the sheer foot-slogging of the candidates' helpers from hamlet to hamlet and farmstead to farmstead, delivering election literature. The problems involved are so great that one can appreciate them properly only by first-hand experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recollect trudging a long distance up a farm drive in order to get to a farmstead and the cottages near by, to deliver literature, and finding great difficulty in making contact with anybody. If nobody was at home one had to find the right door through which to put the literatureâ€”and it was often baffling to know where the letterbox was or, in its absence, the right place to deposit such communications. I thought at that time how much
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0680">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1253</span>
easier it would be if the notification that an election was being held was done officially. The facility of having poll cards in local government elections would go a long way towards doing this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One wonders whether it would be possible for the wording of poll cards somehow to be amended in order to give more information to the elector concerning the election, in particular who the candidates were. I appreciate that there are difficulties of timing. It seems to me, however, that after knowing that an election is to be held, the next most important piece of information for the elector is the list of candidates. Cannot some means be devised by which names of candidates can be included on the poll card, possibly on the reverse side? I hope that some attention can be given to this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred a moment ago to my experience at times in county council elections in rural areas covering large geographical divisions. It is a feature of the reorganisation of local government now going through the electoral divisions that wards for both counties and districts in the coming years will be over larger areas than in general they have been in the past. In particular I see the linking up of what are now urban districts with parishes in rural districts in order to form new wards. Therefore, the difficulty that I had in making contact with electors over scattered rural areas will be an experience which more and more people will have to face under the reorganised system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think, therefore, that we need to look into all possible ways of facilitating the communication with the individual elector. One of the most valuable features of local democracy is the way in which people can make contact with the individual elector to inform him that an election is to be held.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Janet Fookes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe this to be a most constructive and practical suggestion. I, too, speak from experience of conducting my own election campaigns. I have fought seven or eight, and I recall that on occasions where electors have, for some reason, not received an individual election address, they have believed themselves to be not entitled to go and vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was considering whether it was possible to reduce expenses by sending an election address to each household rather
	<span class='label label-info column'>1254</span>
than to each member, this was the one thing which made it at that time impossible to do. It is difficult to make sure that election addresses are sent out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the hon. Lady will not mind my correcting her. We are talking about poll cards, not election addresses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Fookes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is germane because I am suggesting that poll cards are very useful to have because of the impossibility sometimes of sending out election addresses to individual people, who may thereby think they are not entitled to vote. The two are connected. May I, therefore, ask my hon. Friends to give this particular point their very sympathetic consideration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow the hon. Lady on one point which she made, because I was in general agreement with what she said. There is a feeling among the electorate that they have to know their number in order to be able to vote. We have all found this when conducting elections, and, because of the difficulties about people not receiving election addresses, which my hon. Friend referred to, electors sometimes feel that they cannot go to vote because they do not have a piece of paper with their polling number on it. That argument, which was the point the hon. Lady was making, makes a very strong case for adopting the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall), which strengthens the argument for this at a period of transition. Whereas people had. some idea of their wards, of their electoral areas, in the structure of local government which is departing, they are moving into a structure which is new. In order, therefore, to give information to the electorate, to clarify what will be a rather confusing situation for those who have not devoted as much time to local government changes as the Committee has, it is necessary to give to them some idea of the new structure and of what ward they will be voting in. I believe that poll cards would help in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) referred to my links with Cheshire. I would certainly not on every occasion support all the activities of the Cheshire County Council
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0681">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1255</span>
but I think that the initiative which they took on this matter, as far as poll cards were concerned, in their private Act which enabled them to issue poll cardsâ€”I received a poll card as a Cheshire elector in 1970 for the county council electionsâ€”has shown that there is some value in this procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whereas in 1964 and 1967 the polls in Cheshire and Lancashire were roughly comparable, in 1970 when Cheshire issued poll cards but Lancashire, not having that power, did not, there was a four per cent. higher poll in Cheshire than there was in Lancashire. It is true that in terms of the absolute figures, there was a marginal decline in Cheshire as there was throughout the country, but I think the important argument is that there was a much smaller decline in Cheshire than in the roughly comparable county area of Lancashire next door. There is evidence, therefore, from the Cheshire results that this is effective in promoting democratic participation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, as far as the Cheshire experience is concerned, all the members of the Cheshire County Council, irrespective of party, have been very pelased with this operation of poll cards and would wish to see it continued. It is interesting to note that while the County Councils Association and the other local government associations expressed some doubts in 1963 and even more recently, the County Councils Association have now gone on record in support of an Amendment of this nature, the introduction of a system of poll cards throughout local government elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in the light of that fact and the fact that in 1963 the Secretary of State of that day was in general support of the idea of poll cards in local elections, we may have a sympathetic response from the Minister of State this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the comments which have been made on both sides of the Committee in relation to poll cards. Anybody who has had experience of delivery of election material and polling numbers in rural areas will appreciate the difficulties concerned, particularly when one is faced with the problem of an alphabetical register. Perhaps I may give an instance of this. In an area with which I was associated at one time we were astonished when a name appeared on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1256</span>
B list of a gentleman called Lavatory Barney. The only information given about his residence was that he lived in Lower Ham. We searched high and low but could not locate him. We spent some time on this because I was anxious to know the name by which his friends knew him. But unless one can get somebody to put the polling material into working order, it is an extremely difficult and time-consuming job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the importance of local democracy and participation. I should like to point out one danger which was mentioned particularly by the hon. Lady the Member for Merton and Morden (Miss Fookes). That is the fact that the poll card, bearing as it does the number of the elector on the register, is a statement that the elector is entitled to vote in the election which is to take place, but the poll card is not of itself a ticket entitling somebody to vote. There is a very real danger, for which both major parties must take a full share of the blame, that people think that unless they have a poll card they are not entitled to vote. Hon. Members on both sides will have had people say to them that they cannot vote because they do not know their number. Indeed, the pestering for pollcard numbers outside election station polling booths enhances this point, and there are very good organisational reasons why this is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put one point to the Minister about this issue of poll cards, if he can see his way to agree to this Amendment. If he will bear in mind the strong pressures brought on people to know their polling number from the poll card, would he think very carefully about arrangements inside polling stations. In the instance of Bristol the arrangement inside the polling station completely confirms the impression which people have that they must know their number before they can vote. The tables are laid out in such a way that the sections of the register are split up with the numbers headed up, and people are expected to go to the clerk who deals with the section into which their number falls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had a long correspondence with the former Town Clerk of Bristol about this, as not only was the polling station arranged in accordance with the polling numbers, but the first question asked when people went to the table was what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0682">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1257</span>
their number was. I made them issue an instruction that people should not be asked this as the first question, but should be asked their name and address. Recent experience, however, has shown that this is not always done. It is very hard to make the clerks agree to this, as from their point of view the use of polling numbers is far easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The excuse given to me by the Town Clerk at the time, that it was too expensive to use any other method, is not valid, as I know of other authorities where polling numbers are not given this priority and the table are laid out with the street names of each section of the register. If the Minister is prepared to concede this point, would he bear these other points very much in mind? I think we need some counterbalance to the widespread impression abroad at present. With that reservation I wholeheartedly support this Amendment, and I feel that if this Amendment can be accepted we shall be taking a positive step forward in encouraging more participation in local democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have contributed to this debate argues in favour of the Amendment. It indicates quite clearly that, certainly on this issue, there is no party difference between us. The arguments in favour of this Amendment have been put forward, sometimes for practical reasons, like those given by the hon. Lady the Member for Merton and Morden (Miss Fookes) and sometimes for reasons of principle, such as that given by my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin), with his heavy emphasis on local democracy. This emphasis on local democracy has been the central theme running through so many of my right hon. Friend's speeches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea of local democracy, which I share with my right hon. Friend, can only survive provided we encourage and persuade people with everything in our power to take part. I do not think that merely by passing a vote this will be the end of local democracy. I believe that the use of the vote is one of the most valuable parts of our democratic process, and that we should therefore take the opportunity in this Bill to make it as easy as possible
	<span class='label label-info column'>1258</span>
for people to vote. The system existing at present in local elections, whereby public notices are put up outside churches, toilets and all sorts of peculiar public buildings, is not sufficient machinery to inform people even that an election is taking place. I know that this is a very sore point, but nevertheless the idea that we should issue a poll card is one to which I can find no reasonable objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of us, as democrats, are concerned with the low polls at elections. In our own elections, we sometimes become frightened if there is a low poll. So far as local elections are concerned, none of us can be satisfied with a low turn out, whether we win or lose. I would have thought that the use of the official poll card, such as Amendment No. 620 suggests, will play a major part in increasing the turn-out, which can do nothing but good: for the people concerned, in encouraging them to express their judgment on the past activities of candidates and councillors; for the councillors themselves, who then feel either that they have the support of the people, or that they have lost that support. It is essential, above all, if we are to preserve the right element of democracy in our local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This problem of low turn-out does worry us. Most hon. Members have at some time played a part in local elections. I have certainly found in Rhondda that oftentimes, when one goes round canvassing, the first thing that people say is, "Is there an election?" If the party representative happens to miss a house, the people in that house are often completely unaware that an election is taking place. I accept the principle that in the main it should be up to the candidates and parties to make people aware of the claims and policies of their party, but I believe it is necessary to use the machinery of local government to make them aware that a local election is taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that this can be done in any more effective way than through the issue of an official poll card. I use the word "official", as this raises another point that I would like to make, that in the absence of the official poll card there is a tendency among all political parties to issue party poll cards. In this instance party poll cards do not really solve the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0683">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1259</span>
problem, as I suspect they sometimes deceive the electorateâ€”not deliberately, but they have the effect of deceiving people into believing that only one person is standing, and not another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The official poll card is the one that should go out, so that people know that there is an election, that they have the right to vote and they know where they should go to vote. It should then be left to us as parties or candidates to make our own spiel in defence of our policies. If we say that an official poll card is necessary in parliamentary elections, it is equally necessary in local elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most people would accept that parliamentary elections are the most important, but local elections are desperately important. Local councillors play a very important part in our public life, and their decisions impinge on the daily life of our people, often more greatly than many decisions made here. I therefore believe that we should do all possible to encourage people to participate to the fullest in local democracy. We can only do this either by accepting this Amendment, or by saying that the Covernment will consider it at some later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sense of this short debate, with which I have considerable sympathy, is that we should look very carefully indeed at the whole question of arrangements for local government elections. There is a feelingâ€”certainly I get it in my own areaâ€”that we have first and second class elections. If we are to make people take a more active part in local democracy, it is necessary to see how we can remove this difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has ranged rather wider than one would expect on the simple question of the official poll card. It ranged over questions of free post, arrangements of polling stations, and wider fields. I undertake personally to look with my advisors at all the questions raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the question of the polling card, I have personally a considerable sympathy with the point of view expressed on both sides in this Committee. There are problems as to how far one should go: for instance, should poll cards come in for parish council elections? Should it be made compulsory, or is this something that local authorities should have power to do with a discretion which they could
	<span class='label label-info column'>1260</span>
exercise? The cost of the issue of the poll-card falls upon the local rates. One will want to consider various questions of this kind, and to take them into account in considering the other suggestions put forward in this short debate this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An Amendment to the Bill is probably not the right way to do this. Clause 44 gives power to the Home Secretary to draw up election rules. This is the right place for these matters of detail. It would be easier, then, for them to be amended or altered in the light of experience. If the Amendment is withdrawn, I will ensure that these matters, particularly that of poll cards, are considered in the machinery which exists. We should take into account views of the local authority associations, which no doubt will take account of this debate, and the views of the various political parties, one of which is not presented here. In drawing up the election rules I will consider sympathetically and carefully the proposals which have been made in today's debate. The right way to do it is with consultation, through the machinery which exists, and, with that assurance, I invite the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I propose to put the Minister of State, Home Office, out of his agony straight away by telling him that I shall ask leave to withdraw the Amendment. However, I want to raise a few points first, to which he need not reply now, unless he knows the answer without advice. They are by way of shading on the particular question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When he says, "How far ought we to go? Ought we to go down as far as parish councils?", I have great sympathy with him. I can see that a lot of arrangements may have to be made. On the other hand, one must accept that a principle is a principle. If it is right for Parliament and right for county council elections, then it is equally right down to the level of parish council elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will recallâ€”and I chose my words carefullyâ€”that in my opening speech on this debate I spoke about the expense that fell on local government or central government. I did that advisedly in the hope that, in his present genial and beneficent mood, while consulting his advisers, he might consider also how much of the burden ought to be borne by central government. Obviously, this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0684">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1261</span>
is the answer to this. We are all determined that local democracy shall have its runâ€”everywhere, but at any rate the City of Londonâ€”so this is something for which central government ought to be prepared to pay and smile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is that I think both sides of the Committee hope that the issue of official poll cards will come in time for the next elections in local government. Therefore, he will realise that, in asking me to withdraw the Amendment, I am giving him an undated cheque. I am not sure that that is the right analogy. What I am saying is that I am not giving him a time limit to do it, as the Amendment would have sought. I am perfectly happy to do this, if he bears in mind that, if it is to be done, it ought to be done before the next elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other points take up points made by some of my hon. Friends concerning the form of the official poll card, and one matter which I feel has not been taken up adequately. I agree with the Minister of State that we have ranged rather further than a poll card Amendment, but this is inevitable because so much is involved in it. We are all trying to achieve a better form of local democracy. We have all been through the business of canvassing and writing up and writing up and so on. If the Minister and his advisers find their way clear to giving us this in actual practice before the next elections, he is probably saving the eyesight of dozens of our elderly voluntary workers who at the moment have to write up poll cards from horrid computerised official registers, which are calculated to ruin anybody's eyesight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the form of the poll card, looking at it from the point of view of the electors, an extraordinary amount of mythology has crept inâ€”that one cannot vote unless one has a poll card; "I did not vote at the election because I lost my Labour poll card and I would not vote for 'them'." No doubt, hon. Gentlemen opposite have the same experience the other way round. The official poll card should have some notification on it, saying clearly that the simplest minds of all electorsâ€”somebody who intends to vote Conservative, for exampleâ€”can understand that he or she is still entitled to vote even if the poll card is lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1262</span>
The other point is that the official poll card should stand out. I was attracted by the idea put forward by one of my hon. Friends that there should be a facsimile of a ballot paper perhaps on the back of the poll card or that the poll card should be in the form of a ballot paper. It should show exactly what would be required to be done. Then it struck me that someone would think that this was the actual voting paper. The trouble that that would cause would be quite appalling. So that suggestion is out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, there is good scope here for looking at the whole format of the official poll card. This is an excellent opportunity to do it. Incidentally, when it is done, one might use the lesson in parliamentary elections also. We know what we are after now and, if we can find something to meet the case, so much the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, if you will shut one eye, Sir Stephen, we can be saved a debate on the Clause stand part. This debate has ranged a little wide already. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) discussed the number. I have said before that the number becomes magic in people's minds. My hon. Friend said that this is rather amplified by the fact that the political parties have their representatives outside the polling station. Equally, polling station clerks, perhaps because they are not as experienced as they might be, sometimes tend to frighten people in asking them immediately for their number. I do not think it happens very often. I have seen it happen occasionally, and other hon. Gentlemen also may have seen it happen. I do not know that it actually puts people off voting. I should have thought that those who had gone there to vote would not leave until they had voted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rather like the idea of the friendly neighbourhood polling station, as opposed to an austere place where one has to run the gauntlet of cold examining eyes before one is entitled to register one's vote. While, on the whole, I pay tribute, as I think any hon. Member here would, to the conduct of those who work so hard and selflessly in elections, it is always good to see from time to time whether we really are satisfied or could improve it a little more. Elections have been with us for quite some time now, and there is no reason why we should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0685">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1263</span>
always follow every procedure that has gone before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But this is a long way from poll cards, and I was trying to save a "Clause stand part" debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis and with those reservations, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a small Amendment, whose effect is to fix as nearly as possible a day for the election of councillors for a local government area, rather than to hover between the two months of April and May.

My hon. Friend the Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall), when we discussed it, took me to task for this Amendment, because he said that there were two possible interpretations of "the first week in May": one could mean the first seven days or the first full week. I explained to him, and on a number of occasions to this Committee, that it is not for me to act as an unpaid draftsman. I am trying to say that it should be on the first Thursday in May, and that is the sense of my Amendment. Whether I achieve it by the wording or not is immaterial so long as the Committee understands what I am about.

We have tried to eliminate all sorts of complications in electoral arrangements, and some such Amendment as my right hon. Friend's would eliminate the necessity for the electorate to be advised not later than 1st March in the preceding year that it is in April this year, in May, and then back to April again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I started with considerable sympathy towards the Amendment. My own view is that if we could have elections on something like the first Thursday in May and everybody understood that, there would be a considerable advantage in it. But the proposal has received almost unanimous opposition from the local authority associations. Everybody agrees that the ideal is the first Thursday in May. One minor problem is that Ascension Dayâ€”coming back to a religious pointâ€”can fall on the first Thursday in May, so that quite a number of the church schools, which are normally used for election purposes, are not available on that day. The other reason is that there could be changes in the habits of people over the years, and that the local authority associations feelâ€”and I have some sympathy with their point of viewâ€”that to tie it rigidly in that way would, in the long term, probably have disadvantages. There is the disadvantage which I mentioned about Ascension Day; but the County Councils Association, the A.M.C., the U.D.C.A., and the Rural District Councils Association, have all made representations to us that we should not fix it in so rigid a way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1265</span>
fact that schools are closed on Ascension Day seems not an inconvenient arrangement, because they would be used as polling stations anyway, and therefore not available for us as schools. My second point is: is not some of the force of what the local authority associations say taken away by the fact that we are fixing the ordinary date for an election as the same throughout England and Wales, whereas the moment there is a difference between Saturdays, Thursdays, Tuesdays, Mondays, and so on, we are imposing a certain amount of rigidity. Therefore, why not the first Thursday in May?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that church schools would not be available for election purposes on Ascension Day. It comes back to whether, bearing in mind the desirability, on which I agree with the hon. Gentleman, of having elections as far as possible on a date which everybody understands will be the first Thursday in May, we are right in tying this for a long time in the future, perhaps about 25 years, into an Act laying down that it must be that date in all circumstances, no matter what other events may arise in the meantime. It could be done by administrative means; but it is a strong argument put forward by the local authority associations that they would like not to be tied absolutely to that in law in all circumstances, irrespective of what might occur while this Bill is in force, which may be a much longer time than most of us are here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arguments which the Minister of State has adumbrated are not insuperable, though they are interesting and doubtless deserve to be met. I am speaking at the moment without the book on the argument about Ascension Day. I am certain of my first point, which is that whatever the legal meaningâ€”my hon. Friend the Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall) will not have to listen at this stageâ€”of "the first week in May", I am not
	<span class='label label-info column'>1266</span>
confining it to the first Thursday, though I hope it would be. There is, therefore, that amount of latitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is that my memory is that the Representation of the People Actsâ€”and here I am liable to be shot down, for I may be quite wrong on itâ€”in dealing with Parliamentary elections, meet this base of the argument. I thought it said that when polling day would be on Ascension Day, it would automatically be moved a week later, to the Thursday following. I do not expect the Minister of State to know this any more than I do, but it is at the back of my mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if it were not so, it could easily be done. I appreciate his point about the Church schools; it is a practical point. But I followed something else he was saying with great interest, and if he could give me a reasonable assurance on it, I should be prepared to withdraw the Amendment. He agreed, as I understood him, with the ideal of the situation, but he did not like the rigidity of putting it into an Act; it would be much better done by administrative action. If, therefore, he were willing to consider looking at the Bill with a view to introducing an Amendment on Report which would give the Home Secretary power by order to create a certain day each year in the first week in May, that would meet the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He would, since he knows his calendar, in practice be saying that as Ascension Day is on the first Thursday in May in three years' time, so in that year, polling day in local elections shall be on a Wednesday, or. if he likes, the Thursday following. He could certainly do it by such an Order in Council, and if he is willing to consider that possibility, I am willing to withdraw this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
