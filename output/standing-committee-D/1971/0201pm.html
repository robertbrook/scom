<p>—and others too numerous to mention. I congratulate the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) on his diligence in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1170</span>
putting down the consequential Amendments.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having spent the morning dealing with the dizzy heights of the aldermanic bench, the existence thereof or otherwise, we return this afternoon to the grass roots of local government in terms of a number of matters concerning parishes.<br><br>
As you have stated, Sir Stephen, grouped with the Amendment there are about 70 others which make the same point throughout the rest of the Bill. I am sure that the printers, if no one else, will be relieved when this group of Amendments has been dealt with, since that should reduce the size of the Amendment Paper considerably. I apologise for putting down all the Amendments until the Clerks warned me that it was not necessary since consequential Amendments would be taken into account in redrafting the Bill for the Report stage.<br><br>
The Amendments relate to the constitutional oversight of parishes. This is less a matter of local authority function than a question of a quasi-judicial power to be exercised by a higher tier in local government. At present the constitutional oversight of parishes is dealt with by the county councils. This power includes such matters as the establishment and dissolution of parish and community councils or groups of parish councils, fixing the number of parish and community councillors, changing the names of parishes and communities, the conferment of parish council powers on parish meetings, compulsory acquisition on behalf of parishes and communities, and a number of other matters besides.<br><br>
The Bill proposes that there should be a change in the system and that the power with regard to the constitutional oversight should be removed from counties and given to the new district councils. Why have the Government put forward the proposal? I can see no good reason for it. I believe there are good reasons for leaving the constitutional oversight with the counties.<br><br>
First it is desirable that counties should be directly concerned with parishes and not with the relatively more remote exercise of their own administrative function. Secondly, to make the proposed change in the Bill would mean the transfer of power from authorities with a traditional knowledge of exercising it to new authori
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0637">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1171</span>
ties with no such knowledge or experience. Thirdly—and this I believe to be an important point—the functions of district, parish and community councils are concurrent. Therefore, it is considered, and in some circles feared, that if the power of overseeing the parishes were given to the district, it could be used in a way not entirely relevant to the welfare of parishes, communities and their councils. It would be better not to risk the possibility of a feeling that district changes were not in the best interest of parishes. If the Government do not accept the Amendments, it will give rise to unnecessary fears and worries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have added my name to many of the Amendments because they deal with a serious matter and deserve thorough consideration by the Committee. The case made out by both the Parish Councils Association and county councils is understandable.<br><br>
It is well understood that the Association of Municipal Corporations has indicated its support of the Government's proposals. I would not expect it to do otherwise. In spite of that, and my own contact with the A.M.C. with regard to general matters, the balance of argument favours the suggestion proposed by the Amendments.<br><br>
I find it hard to see why the Government have changed the rôles. I agree that some parishes come close in to our urban areas; the position is different today from that in earlier years because our towns have expanded. On the fringes of many of our towns are some of the most active parish councils. In some of those cases, the argument might be made that there is a close affinity between those parishes and the kind of urban parishes or neighbourhood councils that some of us have been trying to establish in the towns themselves, as a kind of grass roots authority.<br><br>
I am sure that my hon. Friends and I at any rate would not object if, in the case of these urban authorities—or urban parishes, or neighbourhood councils—the district councils were to play an appropriate part and have some responsibility in their establishment. Indeed, it is unreal to imagine that even if the provisions in the Bill were changed and the counties were restored to their previous responsibility in this connection, the district councils would necessarily be left out of the picture.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1172</span>
I cannot imagine that the county councils would carry out their accustomed function, any more than in the past, without consultation with the new district councils which, I agree, will cover a larger area than was previously the case. Thus consultation would take place, whether provided for statutorily in the Bill or under regulations, or by any other means. I believe that that would be accepted by everyone.<br><br>
I wished merely to indicate that there is no reason why the interests of district councils in this connection should not be satisfactorily served by consultation and in other ways, as I am sure would be the intention of the counties. While not wishing to be dogmatic, I think that the counties have a strong case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Heseltine)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members who have spoken to the Amendment have put the position clearly and concisely before the Committee. I do not dissent from the arguments in support of this group of Amendments, which represent a fair and comprehensive view of the case.<br><br>
The matter is one of controversy. The local authority associations are not able to agree among themselves. As the hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) indicated, it is not altogether surprising that the grouping has materialised in the way that it has.<br><br>
The first and most important question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) was, why this change? The Local Government Act, 1933 places responsibility for this series of functions with the existing counties, and, in view of the experience of this Administration to date, there seems to be no good reason for change.<br><br>
In reply to that argument, it may be said that local government reorganisation has provided an opportunity to look again at the complete range of functions as apportioned between two quite new authorities. The counties as envisaged in the Bill are not the counties as they exist at present. There are many views as to the degree of difference, but no one doubts that they will be very different. Indeed, it is intended that that should be the case.<br><br>
Thus we have looked at the new counties, and we have asked questions about the apportionment of functions. It is in the context of the general review starting from scratch, without a disposition to stick particularly to what has gone
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0638">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1173</span>
on before, that we have come, on balance, to the proposals embodied in the Bill.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Devizes was right in summarising briefly the sort of main powers that are affected by his Amendments. Broadly, there are some six areas of responsibility that would be changed if we were to accept this group of 80 Amendments. The change would transfer the overall responsibility from the proposed districts to the proposed counties for, first, the establishment, the dissolution and the grouping of parish councils.<br><br>
Secondly, it would provide for the number of members for either a parish or community council. Thirdly, it would review the areas of parishes or communities and provide for making representations to either the English or the Welsh Commission; fourthly, for reviewing the electoral arrangements of the parishes or communities; fifthly, for removing the disabilities from voting for a member of the parish or community council; finally, for conferring parish council powers on the parish meeting of a parish without a separate parish council. This does not apply to Wales; it applies only to England. Those are the broad powers which would be affected, and which it is proposed to transfer if the Committee were to accept this group of Amendments.<br><br>
4.45 p.m.<br><br>
There are five points that I want to make in suggesting to the Committee that we should accept the proposals put forward by the Government. First, in exactly the same way as the counties will be new, so will the districts. They will be fewer in number; they will be more powerful, and will employ large numbers of staff. The new districts will each employ between 75 and 100 people. Even in sparsely populated areas the target will be approximately 40,000 people within the area of the new district councils.<br><br>
There is no doubt that a new order of responsibility and opportunity will be open to these new authorities. From this increased size and wealth will flow the need to employ larger staffs. This argues in favour of district councils being able to carry out their responsibilities.<br><br>
The third group of arguments are particularly important, and these were hinted at by the hon. Member for South Shields. We see the district councils as being local councils, dealing with local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1174</span>
matters and people, dealing on the ground with the particular problems that affect an identifiable community as could possibly be contrived in the new drawing of the boundaries. The relationship, therefore, between the parish councils and the new district councils would be augmented and encouraged if the district councils had the responsibility of the kind that it is proposed to give them.<br><br>
It is possible—in fact, desirable—that many district councillors will serve on the parishes and will have a close relationship with them. All our arguments and attitudes would be in favour of this sort of relationship. I believe that it is right, therefore, that the various reviewing responsibilities should lie within the hands of the district authorities.<br><br>
The fourth argument is that the district councillors must have, in general terms, a much closer contact and greater knowledge locally of the particular problems—it is the local and small-scale problems which are affected in many of these decisions—and district councillors are more likely to be in touch with the problems on the ground and, therefore, more able to make decisions that will be acceptable locally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister not feel that this kind of association—which I accept as being necessary—could be met by the normal method of consultation which could either be written into the Bill or provided by regulations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think this is important, and I will return to it when I have finished the list of arguments which I think, on balance, lead to the Government's conclusions.<br><br>
The fifth reason—and, if one has a balance of argument, the one that has finally influenced the Government—is that wherever the judgment lay equally before us, we found it in favour of giving the powers to the districts. We are anxious that the districts should be seen to be powerful, and that they should have as many local powers as possible. We want them to play as meaningful a part in local life as can possibly be arranged. Therefore, where the arguments are evenly balanced—I accept the validity of much that has been said in Committee—we have found in favour of giving the power to the district councils.<br><br>
The only other point I want to deal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0639">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1175</span>
with is this question of the possibility of further consultation on the involvement of other bodies and the feeling that could be put forward—I would not say that it is a totally artificial one—that because the powers are so concentrated locally people will, in fact, use the powers for reasons which might have unfortunate effects. It would not happen often, I believe, but we must deal with these contingencies. It has been suggested that district councillors looking at the possible future warding effect in their areas might want to change the areas of boundaries because of the political adjustments that might follow.<br><br>
There are contingencies of this kind, though I fully accept that it is a most unlikely contingency; but, nevertheless, life being what it is, we would be irresponsible in not giving it just a moment's consideration. The feeling could always arise, however irrational, in close communities that people with power were exercising the power for reasons which were not strictly in the interests of the people affected. It is very important to have rights of appeal, rights of consultation and open discussion on these matters, and the feeling that local people can be satisfied that decisions ultimately are examined by people who can take a more detached view.<br><br>
There are two sets of provisions within this Bill which control these difficulties. First of all, on the question of areas for parishes, the Bill provides that there should be initiation at district level, but the initiation goes to the Boundary Commission, and if the recommendations of the Boundary Commission are not accepted, the Commission has the responsibility of involving the Secretary of State who ultimately takes the decision. In areas local difficulties can be reflected all the way up to the Secretary of State who ultimately is responsible.<br><br>
The second set of problems, dealt with under Clause 52, concerns the electoral arrangements. Here again one can imagine that when one is dealing with the number of councillors, and in certain larger parishes the division of parishes into wards, this could be a matter of controversy and concern to local people. Here again there is a series of protective provisions under Clause 52(6) (7), (8), and (9) all of which will commend themselves to the Committee. Initiation for the electoral
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1176</span>
arrangements lies in the hands of the district, but with consultation with the parishes concerned.<br><br>
The next stage involves the Boundary Commission again, who advise the district about the conclusions that should be reached, and if there are disputes at that stage the matter can be referred to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
Not only does all this happen in the event of the district or the Commission not being able to reach an agreement, but it is also a possible mechanism where 30 electors in any given parish have the right to implement the machinery and escalate the various outstanding difficulties to the Secretary of State. Not only have the authorities at all levels the opportunity to ensure wider consultation and ultimate decision, but 30 people who are not in any way organised other than that they have come together for this specific purpose have this power.<br><br>
There are in the minds of the Government very compelling reasons for always trying to keep the powers as local as possible. The new districts, and the counties which have hitherto administered these powers, are not the same bodies that will exist after 1974 and should not be confused with them. We have inbuilt under Clauses 50 and 52 various appeal and consultative mechanisms to ensure that there is no possibility that people will feel that decisions are being taken locally which are against their best interests, for there is the ultimate appeal to the Secretary of State and I hope my hon. Friend will feel that the Government have been able to reach, on balance, conclusions which are in conformity with the attitudes of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the arguments which my hon. Friend has put forward, but in his final words he sums up the situation in such a way that it is very much a question of being "on balance" that the Government have reached this conclusion.<br><br>
Although I see the strength of my hon. Friend's argument, I believe that the opposing arguments are equally strong. Whilst it is perfectly understandable that the Government should wish to give the powers to the district as a generalisation, in this case, of course, we are dealing with the third tier of local government, the parishes, which are nearest to the ground of all and nearest to the people.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0640">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1177</span>
It is the parishes themselves which are very keen, I think—because, this is not so much a function but, as I said in my opening remarks, a quasi-judicial power—that this power should remain with the counties.<br><br>
I accept that the new system of local government and the new tiers of local government will, whatever similarities there may be, be different from the existing tiers of local government. The fact that district councils will be larger will enable them, in view of their increased staff, to carry out some functions which they may not be able to perform at present.<br><br>
I hope that in the course of debates on further Amendments during this stage, the Government will pay considerable attention to the views which are put forward on behalf of parishes because it is the parishes and only the parishes—Lord Maud in his Report drew attention to this—to which people really relate themselves in terms of community. Anything above the parish level is purely an administrative set up. No-one has produced any evidence to oppose the conclusion which has been reached by Lord Maud in that respect. Hence, I think it very important that the Government should pay considerable regard to the views which are expressed on behalf of the Parish Council Association.<br><br>
Having said that, Sir Stephen, I should like to consider this point a little further, but, in the meanwhile, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Lamond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 576 in page 5, line 41, leave out "population is 300" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"local government electorate is 200".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we can take the following:</span></p>
<p>Amendment No. 577, in page 6, line 1, leave out "population of 200" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"local government electorate is 150".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Amendment No. 578, in page 6, line 2, leave out "300" and insert "200".</p>
<p>Amendment No. 579, in page 6, line 4, leave out "population of less than 200" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"local government electorate of less than 150".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Amendment No. 580, in page 6, line 20, leave out "population" and insert "local government electorate".</p>
<p>Amendment No. 581, in page 6, line 21, leave out "200" and insert "150".</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1178</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have just heard from the Under-Secretary the arrangements which have been set out in later Clauses for appeals in connection with the exercise of the district council function with regard to setting up or abolishing parish councils. This Clause also sets down the Government's ideas about the limits within which these decisions should be taken.<br><br>
I am aware that the part of this Clause relating to the numbers was taken almost completely from Section 43 of the 1933 Act. I suppose that a strong argument could be made that if there has been no difficulty at all with the wording up to present, there is no need for a change. I should think there would be very much more activity in the setting up of parish councils in the years to come and I believe that it would be much more convenient for all concerned if the wording of this Clause were tightened up.<br><br>
Instead of the use of the word "population"—referring to a population of 300, of 200, or of 150, which is a very difficult thing to assess accurately, especially if there are to be inquiries about these matters—it would be much more convenient if the wording were "local government electorate", the number of whom can always be checked from the electoral register. One can envisage differences of opinion as to the population of a parish, which will not always be easy to arrive at, but one cannot envisage much difference of opinion about the actual number on the electoral register.<br><br>
I think it would tie in better with our democratic ideas if reference was made to the actual number on the electoral register. For instance, one could imagine a parish in which there was a large orphanage with perhaps 200 children and 102 adults, entitled to say that it had a population of over 300. There might be another parish with 149 electors which was not entitled to have a parish council because it did not have a population of 150.<br><br>
I think that the Government and previous legislators recognise this. For example, in Clause 14, the Government speak of "the parish meeting"—
<br><blockquote><p>"The parish meeting of a parish shall consist of the local government electors for the parish."</p></blockquote>
They do not speak of the population of a parish. They do not refer to the population on which we, in our legislation, have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0641">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1179</span>
based their right or not to have a parish council. They refer to the parish council electors, and no one else. It would be much tidier, more convenient and much easier for people to understand if we were to use the words suggested in these Amendments.<br><br>
Having looked at the Amendments, I see that some are not as well worded as they might be. Would the Minister be prepared to look at this point again?</span></p>
<p>5.0 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Richard Sharples)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The criterion is taken from Section 43 of the Local Government Act, 1933. This criterion has always operated and it has involved no great difficulty. On the other hand, there is some force in the arguments put forward by the hon. Gentleman. If we can improve the Bill in this way I am willing to do so. I accept what he has said. I should like the Parliamentary counsel to have a look at the Amendments to see whether they can be improved. I accept the principle of the Amendments and, broadly speaking, I accept the figure that the hon. Member has put forward, which conforms broadly with the population figure of 300.<br><br>
I should like the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the Amendment on the understanding that I shall put down an Amendment on Report to meet his point.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that these Amendments are rather formidable in appearance. I assure the Committee that, to the best of my judgment, having waded through them with great care, they are technical in nature.<br><br>
Amendment No. 582 is the key Amendment of the group. It relates both to the rural boroughs and to the split parishes. Each of the other Government Amendments relates either to one or the other of these two types of authority.<br><br>
Amendment No. 582 contains the basic provision for the creation of a parish council for each of the rural boorughs. Hon. Gentlemen will remember that we discussed this under Clause 1. Provision has been made in Clause 1 for the rural borough to become a new parish on the enactment of the Bill and to continue as a parish after 1st April, 1974. My hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) has put down Amendment No. 257, which is overtaken by Amendment No. 582.<br><br>
The second provision of Amendment No. 582 provides for a parish council to be established for every new parish established from a divided parish under paragraph 1 of Part IV of Schedule 1. Thirdly, the main Amendment provides for a parish council for every parish to which a part of a divided parish is added by paragraph 2 of that Part of the Schedule, if the receiving parish did not have a parish council before. This is a contingency that exists only in the parish of Priddy in Somerset. It is not exactly a widespread situation.<br><br>
The other Amendment affecting the rural boroughs is Amendment No. 590. This provides that the new parish council replacing the former borough council of a rural borough shall have the same number of councillors and, where the rural borough is divided into wards, it shall be similarly divided when it becomes a new parish. It thus makes the transition in status with the minimum of practical disturbance. This is an important point in view of the dual nature of the council. It will be a borough council and at the same time a parish council in the interregnum, during the overlap period between the enactment of the Bill and 1st April, 1974. This is only the immediate provision, and the electoral arrangements for these former rural boroughs may subsequently be altered under the normal arrangements in Part I or Part IV of the Bill.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0643">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1183</span>
Amendment No. 591 amends paragraph 10 of the Bill which provides that casual vacancies shall not be filled for the councils which are going out of existence. In the Bill as drafted, an exception is to be made for London borough council which are not affected. The Amendment extends that exception to rural borough councils, as in this case the same councillors are being retained although in their new status as parish councillors. Therefore, casual vacancies need to be filled in the normal way.<br><br>
Amendment No. 595 provides in detail for the dual nature of the council of a rural borough. The rural boroughs will be both rural boroughs and parishes in the interregnum following the passage of the Bill and 1st April, 1974. On the 1st April, 1974, the rural borough council will cease to have the status of a borough council and will continue solely as a parish council. The Amendment provides that the 1973 election shall take place on the same day as the district council elections, which is the case for ordinary parish councils. It is wished to coincide election day for all authorities throughout the country. It also provides that the mayor of the borough shall simultaneously be chairman of the council of the parish, and also that the deputy mayor shall be the vice-chairman of the parish council. The provision in paragraph (4C) of the Amendment for councillors who come into office is the standard one.<br><br>
Amendment No. 596 is similar to Amendment No. 591 in that it provides for the continued filling of casual vacancies, because the council is to continue, albeit in a different form, in a new status. In this case the vacancy is the casual vacancy of mayor, who will of course became chairman of the new parish council.<br><br>
Amendment No. 597 provides that the timing of a 1973 annual meeting of a rural borough shall not be governed by the general provisions for borough council annual meetings. It is complementary to Amendment No. 598, which provides that the timing of the 1973 annual meeting of a rural borough council is to be governed by the same provisions as those of parish councils, which the rural borough councils will become under the Bill. The whole process is being assimilated into the code for parish councils.<br><br>
Amendment No. 600 is consequential
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1184</span>
on Amendment No. 598 and the fact that the 1973 rural borough council elections will be on the same day as those for parish councils.<br><br>
We now move to another group of problems which arise not from the rural boroughs, but from the split parishes. Amendment No. 592 is a paving Amendment for Amendment No. 594. Amendment No. 594 delegates the existing subparagraph (3) which provides for the tenure of office of parish councillors and substitutes a more elaborate one to take account of the special position of the split parishes. It provides that elections shall not be held after 1972 for the councils of the existing parishes which are to be split. Hon. Members will remember that where there is a split council there are to be two successor organisations. It provides also for the tenure of office of the generality of parish councillors, which is the general case covered by sub-paragraph (3) as at present in the Bill.<br><br>
The third aspect arises for the parish councillors for the existing parishes which are to be split or for the existing parishes to which parts of split parishes are to be added. They are to remain in office until 1st April, 1974. That is to say, these are the parish councils which will continue until the new parish councils for the split parishes or the enlarged parises as the case may be take over on 1st April, 1974.<br><br>
The fourth point provides for the parish councillors elected in 1973 for a parish which is receiving part of a split parish under the Bill not to act until 1st April, 1974, except on matters relating to the preparations for the work of the new expanded parish after that date. In other words, it restricts the power of the new parish councillors elected after 1973 to work relating to the councils on which they will actually serve—that is, those which will come into being on 1st April, 1974.<br><br>
The provisions allow for the continuance of the old parish council in these expanded parishes until 1st April, 1974, but for the new expanded parishes to have what is conceptually separate parish councils from the date of the 1973 parish council elections. In practice, of course, many of the councillors will, in fact, be the same people, although the latter council will also be likely to include people from the added areas where one has brought in parts of split parishes.<br><br>
After that rather detailed explanation

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1185</span>
of the Amendments, I hope that the Committee will agree that they are consequential on the examination we have already had on rural boroughs and on split parishes. It is purely, I believe, the machinery that is necessary to keep the existing framework going or to make the adjustments which the Committee has already examined and be sure that the right people will take the right decisions at the right time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We had quite a lot of discussion on the general point. So far as I can see, the Amendments suggested by the Government carry out what we had in mind. I do not pretend to be an authority on the machinery proposed. I can only say that I assume that if on closer examination some of our friends find the proposals unsatisfactory, we shall be able to raise the matter between now and Report. Otherwise, I welcome the Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a most helpful intervention. If it turns out that on some detail we have misunderstood or mispro-vided, we could have another look at it on Report. But I hope that as I have described the Amendments, and as the hon. Member opposite has accepted them, they reflect what the Committee has already decided.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Goronwy Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make one brief comment? I think I referred to this on Clause 1. It is the position of those boroughs which are subsumed in new districts and then become parishes in one way or another and which carry with them very old and honourable charters. Their chief citizen has always been designated as mayor and the second citizen as deputy mayor.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary explained very clearly how the transition from borough status to parish status would be accompanied in such cases by the translation of the mayor into chairman and the deputy mayor into deputy chairman. In the same spirit as my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop), I wonder whether between now and Report the Under-Secretary and his colleagues might look at the situation to see whether there is any real objection, in the case of a parish council which succeeds itself as previously a borough council, to such a chairman, for traditional and deeply regarded instincts of communal loyalty in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1186</span>
these boroughs, and his deputy being termed mayor and deputy mayor of that parish.<br><br>
I know that this is new. There are many new things in the Bill, most of which we agree to. It is a small point which I hope he will consider between now and Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I have already given an undertaking to look at this point. The Amendments before us deal with the rural boroughs. Those are the boroughs created in the 1958 Act. They are relatively few in number. There is a wider area of discussion centering round the boroughs—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>An hon. Member</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rural boroughs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, not rural boroughs which are a specific form of local government organisation and which have a mayor. The particular concern of the hon. Member is the status of the boroughs which at the moment have mayors but which it is intended should become parishes. I said earlier that we would consider the possibility of turning those boroughs into parishes on the date on which the existing parishes go out of existence, and that we would also consider what title should be given to the chief citizens of those new authorities. There is a much wider issue involved, because it does not relate only to rural boroughs; it also relates to a large number of others.</span></p>
<p>5.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ray Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the point I wish to raise is strictly relevant to the Clause. I live in a rural district in Berkshire which, together with other areas, will become a district authority. At present that rural district authority is made up of a number of parishes, consisting of 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 people. Bracknell, the parish in which I live, is probably one of the country's largest, containing Bracknell New Town.<br><br>
The Bill provides for parishes to continue in existence, although in my parish it will perpetuate an imbalance within the distrct—one parish council looking after the interests of 70, 80 or 100,000 people, as against other parishes with only 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000 people. Will it be possible to vary the parishes or boundaries so that the Bracknell Parish Council, for instance, can be broken down into more representative units?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It may help the hon. Gentleman to know that what he is discussing is dealt with in Part IV.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Amendments fulfil the purpose for which they are intended, but I am concerned that they might affect the proposals—which the Minister has said he will make on Report—for the provision of community councils for boroughs and urban districts. My hon. Friend has answered the point in part, but he said that some boroughs might become parishes. That implies a decision as to the name of the new authorities for which these proposals might set a precedent.<br><br>
Many boroughs would consider the title, "parish" as singularly inappropriate. The Minister said that the title for the chief citizen would be a matter for consideration. I accept that. But there would be concern if what he is doing for rural boroughs set a precedent for the type of community council that he proposes for boroughs and urban districts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help my hon. Friend. I was using existing names to refer to existing beasts, so that people would easily understand when listening to me. I was in no way anticipating—either because I was not thinking about it and therefore was revealing hidden secrets, or consciously, because I was deliberately trying to anticipate decisions—the implications of the questions that my hon. Friend has asked. The assurance that I have given already stands.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That Clause 10 stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We need to give a lingering look at the Clause before leaving it, to satisfy ourselves that it is right. We are providing in the Bill wider planning powers to the counties. Certainly, the structure plans will be in future the responsibility of the counties. If, as is proposed, we are to agree that the counties shall not continue to bear the responsibility with regard to parishes, are we satisfied that the counties will be kept in touch with the procedures in connection with the parishes which I regard as very closely linked with structure planning responsibilities, since structure planning concerns an overall range of functions?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1188</span>
Is the Minister therefore satisfied that the proposal that the district council will have this responsibility in respect of the parishes can be adequately and fully linked with the planning functions of the counties as envisaged in future?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The structure plan does not deal with the delineating of boundaries of either the districts or the parishes. It merely indicates the strategy for the development of the county. It will in no way draw lines on an Ordnance Survey map, but will be merely diagramatic and a statement of policy.<br><br>
As for planning control, quite apart from development planning—the drawing of structure plans—I announced recently, in reply to a Parliamentary Question, that we were tying the parishes up with planning control by the local planning authorities by seeing that the parishes are given notice of planning applications. Thus, there will be links on planning control. However, there is no real necessity, apart from the point of view of public participation, for tying the parish in with the county on structure plans.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had particularly in mind the question of participation as being one in which the link needs to be real and intimate. It may well be that the county, in working out its broad plan for the whole area, will need to take into account the means by which local opinion is to be expressed. Thus it will be important to ensure adequate means of consultation, at least on that aspect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the Skeffington Report proposed that those responsible for drawing the structure plan should ensure that community interests were expressed. Mention was made of neighbourhood councils, and similar methods. I hope that the parishes in future will become so organised as to be able to put a community view before those who are drawing the structure plan. I see the parishes as a powerful unit in the context of public participation, representing not so much a pressure group as one which looks after the entire interests of its parish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This discussion is only marginally in order, if at all. I

hope it will not be further pursued. Mr. Roper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of that ruling, Sir Stephen, you may wish to rule me out of order. I was provoked by the comments of my hon. Friend, and I shall attempt at least to be brief.<br><br>
Would the Minister comment on this point, particularly in view of the representations which he, as representing a Lancashire constituency, will no doubt have received from the Lancashire Association of Parish Councils, with particular reference to notification of planning applications to parish councils—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is out of order. I suspected it from the beginning.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Both Amendments are drafting Amendments. Subsection (5) provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"Parishes grouped under a common parish council before 1st April 1974 and situated in different districts on and after that date shall … continue to be grouped"</p></blockquote>
unless an order is made to dissolve the group or separate parts of it. Orders to dissolve these groups of parishes can be made under subsection (4), but they can also be made under Clause 10(2) and (3). Clause 12(5)(a) refers only to orders made under Clause 12(4), so the Amendment is needed in recognition of the fact that orders to dissolve a group of parishes may also be made under Clause 10. Amendment No. 584 deals with a similar point.<br><br>
It is necessary to ensure that where the group of parishes is situated in several districts the order dissolving the group shall be made jointly by the district councils concerned under Clause 10 as

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brynmor John</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 477, in page 9, line 5, leave out from "councillors" to the end of subsection (1).<br><br>
I can do this with some brevity, since—following what appears to be the custom in this Committee—we have already had half a debate on this topic.<br><br>
The Amendment seeks to limit the eligibility for chairman of the parish council to those who are members of that council, and not merely those who are eligible to be parish councillors. In dealing with this matter the Under-Secretary appeared to draw a distinction between principal councils and parish councils, seeming to suggest that in parish councils it does not matter. To quote his words back to him, this is a matter of principle. If we believe in democracy, we surely believe that democracy is the best system by which we can run our institutions of Government at whatever level we have.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0647">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1191</span>
On the basis of democracy alone we are compelled in logic to restrict to being chairman of the council those people who are actually members of that parish council. I suggest that there is a stronger reason for doing so in the case of parishes than there would be in the case of larger units, because if parish councils have any useful function at all—and in my view they do—it is because their members are more closely connected with the community which elects them than any other body. They are in no way representative of the big battalions, but they are closely connected with the communities. They are amenable to the communities from which they come, and they exist in areas with the greatest sense of community.<br><br>
To say that a man who is prepared to stand remote from elections based on such a body with a sense of community identity is fitted to become chairman of a parish council—having stood aloof from it—is a nonsense. I hope that the Under-Secretary will accept that.<br><br>

My second point is that parish council elections are, by definition, more informal—the rules are strictly carried out but the electioneering is more informal—than in the case of large councils. There is no reason to inhibit any of those mythical people—or people who, I am persuaded, are rapidly becoming mythical creatures; people who are uniquely fitted to be chairmen of parish councils but must not dirty their hands by being involved in elections. Those people have no place in local government. Unless they submit themselves to the will of the people and undergo regular scrutiny and check of their exercise of power they have no part to play in local government. It is time that we accepted this.<br><br>
Having said that, I can tell the Committee that the National Association of Parish Councils takes a contrary view. They say that on a purely utilitarian or pragmatic viewpoint it works in practice. But I am interested in the figures it quotes. According to the latest parish councils review, the number in England is 6,602. According to the association, in 1965 a sample survey gave the figure of probably over 200 nominated chairmen. That seems to be an insignificant proportion—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman say "significant"?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1192</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Insignificant. Two hundred out of 6,600 is insignificant. It is therefore not worth preserving a departure from our normal democratic processes in local government. I hope that the Government will accept the Amendment, because if we are to create a representative local government system which is coherent and consistent we cannot neglect the smaller bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Government will not accept the Amendment. I understand the argument put forward by the hon. Gentleman with regard to democratic processes, but exceptions can be made to this general rule without any harm to anyone. I know of certain anomalies that exist in parish council elections which show that those councils often have rather peculiar constitutional bodies, compared with other elected authorities. In the first instance I was actually coopted to a parish council—I know that that is not the point under discussion—because there was a casual vacancy. A year later there was a parish council election, and the electors had the right either to uphold the decision of the other parish councillors or to kick me out. Luckily they decided to keep me. That is an example of the rather peculiar anomalies that sometimes exist with regard to parish councils, which do no harm.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely, the point is quite dissimilar. At the end of his co-opted period he had the public spirit to submit himself to the subsequent election. The point about a chairman being co-opted from outside the parish council is that he serves his term of a year and disappears before the electorate has any chance to express its view on his tenure of office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that point. We are talking about another anomaly peculiar to parish councils. There is a difference between the situation as it affects parish councils and as it affects district councils, which was debated last Thursday afternoon.<br><br>
If a parish council, under its existing powers, decides to elect an outsider as its chairman, the democratic process has to operate and, if there are enough people in the parish who do not approve of the co-opted chairman, they have every right to stand or to get others to stand so as to ensure that the co-opted chairman does not have a chance to become chairman again. In any case, I cannot see that this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0648">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1193</span>
power which exists at present has been abused. The hon. Gentleman said that there were only about 200 parish councils with co-opted chairman. If there were 2,000, he would have a stronger argument. The fact is that, no doubt for peculiar local reasons, it has been decided in those 200 parishes that an outsider should be co-opted as chairman, and I cannot see that this can do any harm. To take an example, my hon. Friend the Member for Tavistock (Mr. Michael Heseltine) might decide to retire, in the fullness of time, to some village which would be very excited at the thought of having an ex-Minister from the Department of the Environment coming to live there. The village might decide to have him as the parish council chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend has a spare village or two to offer me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that there might be several villages in Wiltshire which would welcome my hon. Friend, provided only that he is generous towards the Amendments dealing with parish councils.<br><br>
Finally, I believe that there are exceptional cases where a well-known individual goes to a village and where the local people would wish to make immediate use of him as a leader. In the fullness of time—and that is not very long—the democratic process will test the decision of the parish councillors as to whether they were right in appointing an outsider as chairman. It is right that this should continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very wisely, Sir Stephen, you—assisted, to some extent, by the whole Committee—decided that it might be a good idea to defer consideration of these Amendments until we had reached Clause 16 and could think them ou for themselves. I have no doubts about my view on this; it is absolutely the view of my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John).<br><br>
The argument of the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) is an attractive argument put in that sort of light. It has all the rural sunshine of Wiltshire on it and one can see all sorts of reasonable parish councillors jumping at the thought of the Under-Secretary coming to live with them and their saying, "That is the man we want". It is a delightful bucolic picture.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1194</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my right hon. Friend consider striking a bargain? If we can persuade the whole of the Government Front Bench to withdraw to some idyllic parish, I think my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John) will withdraw his Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be prepared to offer a timetable, though I feel that it might be rejected.<br><br>
More seriously, the hon. Gentleman makes the argument—which must undoubtedly be true—that there must occasionally be people who would be ideal as chairmen of parish councils but who cannot, for one reason or another, become parish councillors immediately. The illustration which he gave about himself was a good one, though everything turned out for the best because, he was elected.<br><br>
The same statistics produce the opposite argument. The argument of my hon. Friend is that there are 200 in 6,000 where this occurs. This ought not to deter him. The hon. Gentleman says "Ah, but there are 200 cases out of 6,000, and these are important. We must consider them." So, on statistics there is an equality of view. I speak for myself on this. Given equality, and accepting the serious content of the hon. Gentleman's argument, we have the overwhelming political imperative to engage ourselves in the reorganisation of local government for the betterment of local democracy. One can argue that there will be a few hard cases. A few parishes—some 200, significant or insignificant—will lose their chance to select a chairman who has not been elected, but who is immediately available.<br><br>
"Parishes" have been with us since the Domesday Book and for them to have to wait two years or more for a new chairman does not seem to be an intolerable restraint upon them. I prefer the more general view, the more total democratic look. It is personal and is something which I was asked to consider, as we all were. Having said that, I cannot reconcile myself to an exception, however interesting and desirable.<br><br>
To what extent the Under Secretary has a brief upon this I do not know. It seems to me that the proper way of dealing with this matter—since there is no political content in it, although there is an individual content—is to have a free vote. Let us decide for ourselves. There is no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0649">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1195</span>
reason why the Government should take a view one way or the other. It seems to me an eminently reasonable proposition for the Committee to consider.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add a word of gratitude to you, Sir Stephen, for the marginally unorthodox flexibility you showed in allowing us to have another stab at this issue. It was precisely the right thing to do in the circumstances, because we have not had the opportunity in advance of considering a repetition of the existing statutory provision with regard to chairmen of parish councils.<br><br>
When I heard the suggestion that I might be offered the chairmanship of a parish council, it occurred to me that it might provide an overwhelming argument for many hon. Members to vote very strongly in favour of this Amendment, I can assure them that I have no intentions to take the chair of a parish council, and I would not like them, when reaching their decision, to turn this into a personal reflection one way or the other. I feel that there is a lot to be said for both sides of the argument. Certainly, I well understand the powerful democratic argument that has been rehearsed.<br><br>
However, I was also aware, from a knowledge of the way in which very small, often rural, parish communities work, that one may well be depriving those essentially non-political communities of a valuable dimension. I can think of a whole range of people who, while they might be persuaded to take the chair of a parish council, would not become Involved in the democratic electoral process.<br><br>
5.45 p.m.<br><br>
Whilst it would be easy to react against that, saying, "That is intolerable; they ought to have a greater degree of public spirit", I can think of many people who, for good reasons, would either feel that that procedure was unsuitable or would not have the necessary time at their disposal. An example was given by the National Association of Parish Councils of the minister of one faith who did not wish to become involved in a controversial electoral situation. I thought that that was a reasonable argument.<br><br>
One might cite the additional example of an industrialist living in a parish, who is professionally an extremely busy man. He might give to the parish a degree of articulate representation which it might
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1196</span>
otherwise lack in its relationships with other authorities, on a limited number of occasions, provided that he could be persuaded to represent the parish. That was a powerful example in an area which was not one of bitter political controversy.<br><br>
However, it occurred to me that, in the case of such a public-spirited person, living in a parish and wishing to make a contribution of a rather restricted nature—not totally committed to the political operation but wishing to argue for the parish in a district controversy or against the county—there would be no difficulty in the parish asking him: "You have a special skill. You are articulate in a way that we perhaps are not. You know these people in way that we do not. Will you help us with this particular problem, or can we call upon you from time to time? "I am sure that the answer would be, "Yes." Indeed, such a person might find it preferable not to be involved in the disciplinary routine but to be called in on special, <i>ad hoc</i> occasions.<br><br>
Thus I found that I was unable, upon further consideration, to sustain an initially attractive argument. In the end, it is important that the democratic process should be given the opportunity to flourish. There may well be in the immediate short term a diminution in the quality of some of the representatives in particular parishes. That brings us back to the point of people having to find freedom, and live within freedom in order to experience the benefits of freedom. In the final analysis, that is what democracy is all about.<br><br>
Therefore, I recommend that Amendment No. 477 should be accepted, as in the case of Amendment No. 54. I would add that, while accepting what was said by the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin), I cannot believe that any political party would wish to make a stand on this issue. Indeed, many people might hold strong views either way. Certainly, after consultation with my hon. Friend the Minister of State I would be happy if my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Speed) would turn a blind eye to any decisions that might be taken by this side of the Committee. While this should not be taken as a precedent, we should certainly respond to the suggestion of the right hon. Member for Deptford that the decision should be left entirely to the Committee.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Swain</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, speaking from experience, I am surprised that the Minister has put before the Committee the case which he has put forward today for the gradual control of the squirearchy in parishes—I am sorry: I have forgotten what I wanted to say! [<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I very much welcome the remarks of the Under-Secretary. Perhaps I may delay the Committee for one moment longer, because there may be other members of the Committee who are not entirely happy with the attitude the hon. Gentleman has taken. Very early in the Committee's proceedings I referred to the tremendous community interest in villages which resulted in a very high poll for the parish council elections although the powers wielded by the parish were the weakest of any council in the three tiers. That community spirit is referred to by German sociologists as <i>Gemeinschaft,</i> as opposed to the <i>Gessellschaft</i> of the large cities where in fact we have the loneliest people in the country.<br><br>
The example put forward by the parish councils about the Methodist minister is quite absurd. To suggest that a local Methodist minister cannot be elected to the council because it is a predominantly Anglican community is really scraping the barrel for an example.<br><br>
In the evidence given to the Redcliffe-Maud Commission, some 460 parish councils submitted their own statements and there were 24 joint statements. There was no mention in any of that evidence of their wanting to have chairmen taken in from outside. In fact, a large number of parishes said that the parish council was the essence of democracy because of the contact with the electors. A number specifically made the point that all councillors should be elected. Indeed, Letcombe Regis Parish Council in Berkshire wanted legislation to ensure that the chairman would have to be an elected member of the parish council.<br><br>
The Parish Councils Association itself, in its submission to the Redcliffe-Maud Commission, dwelt in paragraph 32 on the quality of a democratic system depending upon the proportion of people entitled to take an active and responsible part in it, and went on to say that any reduction in the number of representatives was strongly to be deprecated. So the quotation given by the Minister is only one view of the National Associa-

tion of Parish Councils. It has been on record on the electoral principle in the past. I hope that other members of the Committee will join the Under-Secretary in supporting the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I remind the Committee that the Minister has decided to accept the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have decided to vote against the Amendment. I was brought to a halt the other day during our preliminary discussion on this matter. I do not intend to rehearse all that I said then. I merely wish to say that I stand by all that I said on that occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot hear the hon. Member. This is not a parish council meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that this is one small anomaly that we can leave. It ought to be left to the local people in the individual parishes. If they wish to have as their chairman a distinguished local schoolmaster, vicar, industrialist or anything else, as a mark of honour and respect, they should be allowed so to do.<br><br>
In a sense, this is a non-argument anyway. I know many parish councils where none of the councillors is elected because they are all returned unopposed. I believe that this is one small thing that we ought to maintain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene only to say that originally I had thought that there was some case for the argument as we understood it from the Association of Parish Councils. Indeed, I think that there is an argument. But I am always concerned to see how this might relate to a wider view of parishes in the future, comprehending, as I hope it will, grassroots organisations in the town as well as in the countryside. If we are to move forward in that way it is important that these are seen to be live bodies that are fully representative and elected by their local communitis. If we do not have that, I do not believe that young people particularly will be much interested in them. For that reason, I am happy to support my hon. Friend's Amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. John</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 478, in page 9, line 12, leave out "may" and insert "shall".<br><br>
The Amendment would remove the discretionary element in the appointment of a vice-chairman and make it a compulsory operation. I suggest this, not for any doctrinal reason, but simply because it seems to me far more convenient for a parish council to have a vice-chairman than otherwise.<br><br>
We read in subsection (7) that the vice-chairman can do
<br><blockquote><p>"… anything authorised or required to be done by … the chairman …"</p></blockquote>
If we look at Schedule 12 we see that whilst there is a mechanism to overcome the absence of a vice-chairman from the council, it is more cumbersome and inconvenient. I believe that if every parish council were to have its vice-chairman things would follow a more natural and ordered course. It is in that spirit, and in the hope that the Government will be equally kind, that I move the Amendment.</span></p>
<p>6.0 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member has said, the Amendment has the effect of making it statutory to have a vice-chairman for parish councils. At present it is a matter left entirely to the discretion of parish councils. This follows the precedent of Section 49(5) of the 1933 Act which gave to the parishes the power to appoint a member of the council as vice-chairman, but left it entirely to them as to whether they should do so.<br><br>
In practical terms, the argument that it should be a matter for them to consider is right. With the size of population with which one might be dealing, say, a population of parishes of some 300 to 400, with perhaps six parish councillors, it is unnecessary to provide that one of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1200</span>
them should be chairman and another vice-chairman. In paragraph 7(3) of Part II of Schedule 12 there is a requirement that when the chairman is absent the parish council must choose one of its members to preside. There is provision so that chaos does not reign in the absence of the chairman. It is unnecessary to introduce this degree of rigidity.<br><br>
The National Association of Parish Councils wishes to retain the present position as embodied in the 1933 Act. I can find no overwhelming reason for changing it, and I believe that experience should argue in favour of the present position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his reply. No great issue of principle arises here. I quoted the substance of Schedule 12 when I introduced the Amendment. There is a mechanism for overcoming the absence of a vice-chairman, but the calling of meetings in the absence of a chairman, or in the refusal of a chairman and the absence of a vice-chairman, is much more cumbersome. It would have the merit of simplicity to have a vice-chairman. Having said that, I am unwilling to press so technical a matter to the vote.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1201</span>
The Amendment has a twofold purpose: first, to probe precisely what the Bill means in respect of the minimum number of parish councillors, secondly, to make the wording about the number of parish councillors more precise. The existing minimum number of parish councillors is five and, under Schedule 12 paragraph 8 which reproduces existing law, the quorum is one-third or three, whichever is the greater. It seems to be implied that the new wording reduces the minimum to four, and it is thought that four is too close in terms of any committee to the point of the committee being unable to perform properly, and also to the point of paralysis.<br><br>
So I hope my hon. Friend, the Parliamentary Secretary will accept this Amendment and enlighten us about the point I made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have looked at the matter as raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison), and having looked carefully through the arguments as I saw them both ways, I believe that his arguments in favour of introducing a contingency of this sort that should not be less than five are good arguments. I certainly would not wish to resist them, I urge the Committee to accept his Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 585, in page 9, line 39, leave out "1979" and insert "1975".<br><br>
Clause 17, too, contains the basic provision for the cycle of parish council elections after 1973. However, the Bill at present contains no provision about when the council elected in 1975 shall come into office. This gap can be filled by substituting 1975 for 1979 in line 39. This would neatly overcome the difficulty, and ensure that the arrangements for coming into office were right for 1975 and all the subsequent elections.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1202</span>
ment No. 274, in page 10, leave out lines 5 to 7 and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"A parish meeting may be held for a parish ward or other part of a parish having a defined boundary and in such case—".</p></blockquote>
The intention of the Amendment is to simplify the Bill as it is at present drawn. Apparently, the rather obscure wording contained in the first three lines of Clause 18, crept into the Parish Councils Act, 1957, but apart from provisions in some local Acts the only known case where a parish meeting is required or authorised—I am quoting the words—
<br><blockquote><p>"… by or under any enactment to be held for a parish ward or other part …"</p></blockquote>
—is where lighting powers were adopted before 1957 for part of a parish and it is desired to adopt them for an additional part.<br><br>
Quite simply, my Amendment seeks to produce a situation in which, if a meeting is required, it should be allowed without this obscure verbiage at the beginning of the Clause which could cause uncertainty and worry to a lot of people who would wonder what on earth it meant. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend will be prepared to accept the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can help my hon. Friend here, but perhaps not quite in the way he requests. I should like to persuade him to withdraw the Amendment. I understand that the problem actually does arise in the very specific question that Be raises of the problems that have been put forward by the National Association of Parish Councils, which is concerned mainly to facilitate the easier definition of specific areas for street lighting under Section 3 of the Parish Councils Act of 1957. There is a place later in the Bill where we can deal with this problem, and we are having consultations now with the National Association to see whether we can deal with the problem that specifically relates to these difficulties.<br><br>
If my hon. Friend will be good enough to accept my good assurances in this matter we will see what we can do at the appropriate stage of the Bill. We do not feel it would be right at this stage to accept a general Amendment to cater for a problem which has been analysed only for the narrow field of street lighting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I shall do as he suggests and ask leave to withdraw the Amendment—

but I wonder whether he will give the wording further thought with a view to changing it, possibly on Report. In the light of what my hon. Friend has said, it seems that the wording is somewhat obscure, and could cause unnecessary uncertainty and worry.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 640, in page 198, line 4, leave out "may, if he thinks fit" and insert "shall".<br><br>
I move this Amendment in an exploratory manner, to ascertain the Government's intentions, because the wording seems to be somewhat difficult. In view of the intimation that I have just had from the Minister I am happy to tell you. Sir Stephen, that I shall not be difficult. I gather that the Government see the force and logic of the argument.<br><br>
When the Boundary Commission reports on the boundaries of districts, the Minister has to do something about them. As the phraseology stands, it seems inconsistent to say, in line 4, that the Minister "may, if he thinks fit", make such an order, whereas in line 6 the clear implication is that he has to make the order. If he does not approve of the proposals in their entirety line 6 gives him the power to make the necessary modifications. In those circumstances it is better to make it obligatory, and to insert the word "shall".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) has explained to the Committee the effect of the Amendment. It would make it mandatory on the Secretary of State to make an order giving effect—either as submitted or with modifications
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1204</span>
—to the English Commissioners' proposals for the initial pattern of non-metropolitan districts in England. The Bill says that the Secretary of State "may" do this if he sees fit.<br><br>
In the Commission is to have any credibility it is essential that we have a convention in the House that the Secretary of State accepts the Commission's proposals, unless there is an exceptional reason which he is prepared to justify to the House for refusing to proceed on those proposals. It could be argued that the Amendment raises a matter of principle, that the Boundary Commission is an independent advisory body, and that the Secretary of State ought not to be legally bound to carry out the proposals it makes, but should be left with a discretion.<br><br>
That is a bit too legalistic. If we make it obligatory on the Secretary of State to bring in an order, whether it be the complete proposal or with some modification, it would be far more satisfactory to the House than to leave it merely to the Secretary of State's discretion. I am quite happy to accept the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 586, in page 198, line 47, leave out second "of" and insert "appointed by".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we can discuss Amendment No. 587, in page 199, line 6, leave out "he" and insert "the returning officer".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the first of these Amendments is to make it clear that the council which the Home Secretary designates to provide a returning officer for the first election of councillors of the new county and district councils would have a duty to appoint one of its officers as the returning officer. As the Bill is drafted, the paragraph requires the Home Secretary to designate the council, otherwise there might be a doubt as to the council's duty to appoint an officer for this purpose.<br><br>
The purpose of Amendment No. 587 is to make clear that it is the council which appointed the returning officer which will have to bear the cost of the first election, and not the council which appointed the officer—he could be an officer of any council—who incurred the expenditure in relation to the holding of the election.</span></p>

<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 587, in page 199, line 6, leave out "he" and insert: "the returning officer".—[<i>Mr. Graham Page.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We come to a series of Amendments, beginning with Amendment No. 588 and finishing with Amendment No. 601 which have already been discussed. If the Committee agrees I suggest we take them together.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I cannot recall that there has been any discussion on Amendments Nos. 588 and 589.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. Amendments Nos. 588 and 589 have not been discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. My Notice Paper was marked incorrectly. The next Amendment for discussion is Amendment No. 588.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 588, in page 199, line 46, leave out "the" and insert "an existing".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we can discuss Amendment No. 589, in page 200, line 2, leave out "the" and insert "an".</span></p>
<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad these Amendments were not missed. Although they look minor Amendments they are really rather interesting and will be welcomed by local authorities because they give wider scope for the use of discretion in connection with arrangements for the first meetings of new councils. They amend paragraph 8 of Schedule 3 which sets out the machinery for the first meeting. As a result, it would not be necessary for only one authority to supply all the officers and all the standing orders for that first meeting.<br><br>
Until the new councils have had their first elections they will not be able to appoint a chairman, deputy chairman or any of the staff. They will not be able to make standing orders either. It is necessary, therefore to provide for that first meeting, and that is done by the establishment of a joint committee. Personally I am not happy with the constitution of the committee.<br><br>
The existing authorities will establish a joint committee for each of the new
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1206</span>
counties and districts. The joint com mittees will have a valuable job to do in preparing for many aspects of the transition to the new structure. One hopes that they will be thoroughly familiar with the local wishes and circumstances of the district, or county, for which they are a committee. They will designate certain persons to carry out the functions of chairman, vice-chairman and staff. They will also choose the standing orders for that first meeting.<br><br>
As the Schedule is drafted, these people would have to be elected from within one authority. It is quite absurd that the clerk, chairman and standing orders should have to come from within one authority. The Amendments give an opportunity to choose from among the many authorities forming one district who will take on the functions of chairman and standing orders for the first meeting. It gives freedom to the joint committee to decide who shall partake in the first meeting and set up the standing orders around the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the fact that the Minister has moved the Amendment and that we have been given time to discuss it. Particularly in areas where there may have been two county boroughs or more, or in other situations where a number of authorities are coming together, there could be much additional friction if the freedom given by the Minister's Amendment to the joint committee did not exist, and it were suggested that Big Brother So-and-So's regulations or standing orders would be imposed upon everbody else. It adds a useful degree of flexibility to this rather complicated and difficult transitional period. I am sure that it will be welcomed by all members of the Committee.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this Schedule, as amended, be the Third Schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad that the Schedule has now been amended to include this last group of Amendments dealing with the rural boroughs and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0656">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1209</span>
particular changes in electoral practices that will follow consequentially upon the Amendments that we took earlier, dealing with the rural boroughs which will become parishes.<br><br>
However, there are two points which I should like the Minister to clarify. In paragraph 3 there is a reference to the warding arrangements—the division of districts into electoral areas, and the Secretary of State
<br><blockquote><p>"carrying out such consultations as he thinks appropriate".</p></blockquote>
I hope that we can have an assurance from the Minister that, within the scope of such consultations, he implies consultations with all the existing authorities.<br><br>
Secondly, on paragraph 5, as we know already from the Amendments moved earlier there is the question of the designation of an officer of a council to be a returning officer for the first elections during the transitional period. It would help if the Minister could give us some idea of the consultations he intends to have with the local authority associations on the method to be adopted for this. In particular, in the new districts where a number of authorities are being brought together, I should like to know whether it will be possible for the clerks of all the authorities, other than those designated as returning officers, to be designated as deputy returning officers, in order to facilitate the transitional arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On paragraph 3, the consultations will be with all the authorities concerned in order to get the views of all the authorities. I am afraid that I have forgotten the hon. Gentleman's second point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It concerns paragraph 5. Perhaps the point concerns the Minister of State, Home Office—I am not quite sure. It concerns the designation of returning officers for the first elections. Will the local authority associations be consulted on the procedure to be used by the Secretary of State for selecting a designated clerk as returning officer? Will the Secretary of State also ensure that in a situation where a new district is composed of a number of existing authorities the clerk of one authority will be designated to be returning officer, and will the clerks of the other authorities be designated as deputy returning officers? It is quite clear that the clerk of the existing main authority will probably have most experience only in his own
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1210</span>
area, and the clerks of the other areas will have something to contribute as deputy returning officers in these first transitional elections.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's first point, the answer is "Yes". The answer to the second point is that there will be consultations. The hon. Gentleman has raised a good point, and I should like to consider it.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Schedule, as amended, agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause</i> 20 <i>ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

Clause 41</div> <!-- clause -->

REGISTRATION OFFICERS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Clause deals with the appointment of registration officers for constituencies, and although no Amendment has been tabled I should like to say to the Minister of State or the Under-Secretary that since the Clause specifically states that the registration officer shall be an officer of the council, we can, for a considerable period of time until the next review of constituency boundaries, have in many constituencies a number of registration officers. My own constituency, for example, will divide three ways: part of it will be in Liverpool, part of it in the new District (<i>c</i>) of Merseyside, and part of it will be in Cheshire.<br><br>
Reading the Clause as it stands, the responsibility for registering electors will depend upon an officer of the three councils concerned. It would not be possible for the councils to get together within one constituency, at least in the interim, to decide to appoint a registration officer who shall be the registration officer of the whole constituency, albeit he is an officer not of this council, but of another council.<br><br>
There are many difficulties in the job of a registration officer. We all know, sometimes to our cost, that during the course of an election one finds many people not on the register who ought to be on. There are occasions in an election when one finds a whole area not on the register which ought to be on. It is an extremely difficult job for the registration officer to perform, and to that extent the Minister will argue, perhaps with some justification, that it is better for the registration officer to be an officer of the council immediately in that area.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0657">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1211</span>
We also come to the question of coordination. Many electoral registers are produced today with the aid of computers. The general unit under which a register is composed at the moment is, if I am not mistaken, a parliamentary constituency rather than a local government area. It seems that the situation will right itself after the next boundary review of parliamentary constituencies, but there could be at least two parliamentary elections before that.<br><br>
Is it possible, or would an Amendment at a subsequent stage make it possible, for councils to appoint a registration officer on a constituency basis, who might be an officer of another council. Some registration officers will find themselves the registration officers of a number of constituencies, and some constituencies will find themselves in the hands of a number of registration officers. This is an important point, bearing in mind the experience of every member of the Committee that glaring anomalies can sometimes occur during the course of an election whereby people are disenfranchised, and the discovery is made perhaps at 9 o'clock on polling night when it is far too late to remedy the situation.<br><br>
Has the Minister therefore any suggestion aimed at remedying the possibility of confusion which might arise through use of the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"… an officer of the council…."</p></blockquote>
rather than an officer appointed by the various councils?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised a most important point, to which we have given some consideration. Paragraph 10 of Schedule 6 provides that the Home Secretary shall have the power to make regulations about registration in straggling constituencies, a power taken specifically in order to deal with this problem.<br><br>
I cannot give the Committee a definitive answer this evening. However, there is to be a meeting on Friday at the Home Office of the political party and other representatives in order to discuss this very real problem, and, it is hoped, arrive at a satisfactory solution. It is a technical point, of particular importance to hon. Members. I am grateful to the hon. Member for raising this question.</span></p>

RETURNING OFFICERS AT PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 641, in page 20, line 16, leave out subsections (1), (2) and (3) and insert:
<ol>
<li>In England and Wales the returning officer for a Parliamentary election shall be—</li>
<ol>
<li>in the case of a constituency wholly con- contained within a district or a London borough the registration officer appointed by the Council of that district.</li>
<li>in all other cases, such registration officers as may be designated by the Secretary of State.</li></ol></ol></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we can take the following:</span></p>
<p>Amendment No. 642, in Clause 43, page 21, line 28, leave out from beginning to "and" in line 30 and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"The returning officer for an election of councillor for the county council shall be the registration officer of the district council covering that electoral area".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Amendment No. 643, in Schedule 6, page 216, line 37, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of sections 55, 69 and 70 of the Representation of the People Act 1949, the term 'appropriate officer' shall be construed as meaning the returning officer.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) said on the last Amendment, there is considerable confusion in the public mind with respect to the gobbledegook of political practice. Those of us in political parties are fortunate in that people advise us from time to time of the date at which our nominations should be put in, the people we should see and the people to whom representations should be made about polling districts and polling booths—all the mechanics and paraphernalia of election. However, in a democracy it is open to anyone to stand for election, whether or not such expert advice is available to him. My hon. Friends and I think that any citizen should be able to read the appropriate Act in order to discover precisely what his rights are, and with whom he should make contact from time to time.<br><br>
In my experience, nothing causes more confusion than the conflict between the returning officer, the registration officer, the electoral registration officer—all those who carry that type of designation. The Amendment therefore seeks particularly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0658">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1213</span>
to clarify the position with respect to the registration officer.<br><br>
As proposed in the Bill, the office of the returning officer—normally the mayor or chairman—is virtually a titular office. Indeed, the Bill places much greater limitation upon him than is the case under Sections 17 and 18 of the Representation of the People Act, 1949. Thus we feel that we should insert into the Schedule the wording of the Amendment, which clearly states the powers and duties of the registration officer as distinct from the returning officer.<br><br>
Does the Minister therefore consider that there would be any advantage in using this wording, which we believe would be greatly to the public benefit in clarifying electoral language in the terms of the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend that there is a lot of gobblede-gook concerning the returning officer, the deputy returning officer, the acting returning officer of which we are all aware, not so much when we are involved in our own elections—win or lose, at such times one's mind is on matters other than the formalities of who is declaring the results—but perhaps when watching on television the results of a by-election.<br><br>
For example, one often hears:
<br><blockquote><p>"I, the undersigned, being the deputy acting returning officer …"</p></blockquote>
Indeed, my small son has posed to me the questions "What has happened to the returning officer? What has happened to the deputy returning officer?" whereby we are down to the deputy acting returning officer to announce the result. In this country we are used to this. I wonder what strangers to these shores, who watch our election results, think about the way we conduct elections when the returning officer and the acting returning officer somehow have been eliminated during the course of the election.<br><br>
In all seriousness, Sir Stephen, there is a lot of nonsense so far as returning officers are concerned. The returning officer should be the returning officer and there should not be the necessity for a deputy or, unless the man is ill or for some other specific reason, for a deputy acting returning officer, as a matter of course, declaring the result of an election. I support entirely what my hon. Friend has said, and I wonder whether the Minister of State can simplify the proce-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1214</span>
dure which will make it much more intelligible now that we have a Bill before the House which will enable us to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish I were able to be quite as forthcoming as I have been on the other Amendments, but the effect would be for the returning officer at a parliamentary election to be a local government officer, that is to say, the electoral registration officer.<br><br>
This is not a matter of great principle which we are discussing on these Amendments. We have had as the returning officer, the person who does the formal work traditionally, someone like the sheriff or the mayor, who receives the writ and who announces the result on television. There is something to be said for retaining someone in that position, a person of high standing and stature in the local community, actually to carry out the formal duties. Everybody understands perfectly well the detailed work. In fact it is compulsory that the detailed work is done by the acting returning officer who is the local government official. I must say that I always enjoy my glass of sherry with the mayor when I go in to hand in my nomination.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Minister's opponent accompanies him on these occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are always the three of us there, and we have a very pleasant glass of sherry with the mayor.<br><br>
We have received no strong objections from any of the political parties and I am advised to leave the arrangements as they are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The language that the Minister of State used is interesting. He seems to have given himself away. I believe his constituency is Sutton and Cheam. The fact that he is having a glass of sherry with the mayor suggests that the counting of the votes at his election is being conducted at a civilised hour early in the morning. I am glad to say that it is always a glass of whisky that I have with my opponent, because we conduct our election count very late at night after a very hard day's work. In the case of my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. George Thomas) he would take exception both to the glass of sherry and to the glass of whisky.<br><br>
To come to the point, I see the force of the Minister of State's suggestion and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0659">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1215</span>
I do not think that anybody would take issue with him that the person formally making the declaration should be the mayor or the chairman of the council. Would he consider this a little further? It seems to me that for the purpose of achieving simplicity in the statutes, it might be possible to designate both a returning officer and an election officer, the one to be in charge of procedures of the election, including counting the votes, and the returning officer performing the ceremonial part of the election. It seems rather more sensible to adopt that procedure.<br><br>
Will the Minister undertake to consider this between now and Report, and if he thinks there is any merit in our suggestion, perhaps he will return to the subject at that stage?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly consider what the hon. Gentleman says, but we are talking about names, and unless we are to make a change in substance, it is probably better to stick to the names we have. I will certainly consider what he has said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, because when we lecture on our democratic
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1216</span>
process it is most important in an educational sense that we should be backed be statute, which in practice gives correct titles and designations to people performing various functions at the time of elections. I am grateful to the Minister for undertaking to think about it and, in those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 646, in page 21, line 9, after "council", insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"or the mayor of a London borough".</p></blockquote>
