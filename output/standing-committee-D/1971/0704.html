ATTENDANCE ALLOWANCES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed</i>—(<i>29th June</i>)—That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Mr. Paul Dean)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At our last meeting the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) raised a number of important issues in this "Clause stand part" debate and it may be for the convenience of the Committee if I deal with them now and give hon. Members more information about the way in which we envisage the Clause and the extension of the allowance working in practice.<br><br>
The right hon. Lady opened her remarks by referring to the Money Resolution. I assure the Committee that the Money Resolution is normal and in accordance with the precedent followed by Governments of both parties. Money Resolutions are always drawn fairly tightly because of the public expenditure considerations involved, but this does not in any way tie the Committee when discussing the conditions for entitlement, or the phasing of the extension of the allowance which appears in Schedule 4.<br><br>
The Clause extends the scope of the allowance to those requiring attention or supervision day or night, in addition to the existing categories of day and night. The proposal is that the day and night requirement for attention and supervision shall be at the higher rate, uprated by Schedule 1, and that the day or night provision shall be at the lower rate. It is important to remind the Committee that in judging both the existing attendance allowance and the extension of the allowance the main criterion is not the extent of the disability of the person concerned,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 316</span>
but the amount of attendance actually required. It is with that in mind that the higher and lower rate have been provided. The right hon. Lady asked me for more details of the proposed arrangements. I interrupted her to explain that the Bill provided for arrangements similar to those currently obtaining for the first stage of the allowance which started in December, 1971. The right hon. Lady quoted subsection (3) but only part of it. If she had read on, she would have seen that the subsection continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"but, except in so far as regulations otherwise provide—"</p></blockquote>
If paragraph (<i>a</i>) is read in conjunction with subsection (2)(<i>b</i>), it provides for the allowance in each of the groups to be paid from the date when that group becomes eligible. In other words, all those people in that group who have applied within the period stipulated will be eligible to receive the allowance from the date laid down. The actual laying down of the dates is provided for in paragraph 3 of Schedule 4, Part II, which deals with commencing orders for the four groups.<br><br>
The commencing orders have not yet been made, and it was to maintain as much flexibility as possible and to push ahead as fast as possible that the arrangements were made in this way, rather than a rigid series of dates being laid down in the Bill. I shall refer to that in more detail shortly, but that is the background to the provisions of the Clause and the supporting Schedule.<br><br>
The right hon. Lady claimed that the Government had been forced into the extension by pressure and by the number of hard cases that were omitted from the first phase. That is not so. The Government said at the outset—and there was no party political disagreement about this—that it was desirable to start first with those most severely disabled and to try to get the allowance to them as speedily as possible, a procedure which entailed the drawing of strict criteria for the allowance.<br><br>
I willingly concede that the criteria which were drawn last year were exactly those which were drawn by the previous Administration in the Bill which fell on the General Election. Admittedly, we made some changes in the allowance, but the criteria remained the same.<br><br>
Of course, we realised that there would be hard cases. It is a classic phenomenon with allowances of this kind that when
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0734">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 317</span>
no allowance is granted, there are no hard cases, and immediately one introduces an allowance, hard cases appear. The Government accepted at the outset that this represented only a start and that the allowance should be extended as speedily as possible. Clearly, some of the heartbreaking cases which have emerged and which have been outside the existing allowance have increased our incentive to push ahead urgently with stage two.<br><br>
In this connection, I wish to quote some figures relating to allowances that are relevant to understanding the Clause. According to the latest figures available, there have been more than 150,000 claims, compared with the original estimate of 100,000 claims. Awards made totalled 95,000, while awards currently in payment totalled 78,000, the difference between the two figures being largely accounted for by the high death rate among those who receive the allowance.<br><br>
The figures illustrate the great amount of work done already by the Attendance Allowance Board and its assistants to get the allowance into payment to the large number of eligible, and, equally, claims are still coming in at the rate of more than 1,000 a week. It is important to remind the Committee that we shall be starting stage two within 12 months of stage one beginning, and there is still a substantial flow of claims under stage one.<br><br>
That will continue after the new arrangements start, because the new arrangements do not in any way disqualify people from claiming for the higher allowance if they feel that they are entitled to it. If they are entitled to it, they will of course be paid the higher rate. We shall therefore be running the continuation of stage one and stage two alongside each other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Barbara Castle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman claimed that the Bill guaranteed that payments would be made from the date of eligibility to claim, that is, the preceding six months. It is difficult to follow the wording of a Bill immediately and it has taken me a little time to assess what the hon. Gentleman was saying. Subsection (3) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"An attendance allowance shall not be payable to a person for any period preceding the date on which he makes a claim."</p></blockquote>
That was the basis of my argument, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 318</span>
the hon. Gentleman admitted that on its own it looked pretty conclusive. However, he said, I must take it with paragraph (<i>a</i>). Subsection (3) continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"… but, except in so far as regulations otherwise provide,—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>a claim for an attendance allowance may be made during the period of six months men tioned in subsection 2(<i>b</i>) above "—</p></blockquote>
I stress the word "may". Subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"… the period for which attendance allowance is payable to any person shall be that specified in a certificate issued in respect of him by the Attendance Allowance Board as being—(<i>b</i>) one immediately preceded by a period of not less than six months throughout which he satisfied or is likely to satisfy one or both of those conditions."</p></blockquote>
To the lay mind that does not seem to say anything other than, "You may make a claim for attendance allowance, but until you do make a claim for an allowance, you are not eligible." Surely it does mean that. The hon. Gentleman referred me to the operation of the previous attendance allowance arrangements, but there we were not dealing with the type of phasing in with which we are dealing here. Under the previous arrangements, eligibility for the allowance became immediate for everybody, and therefore it was paid as soon as the claim was made. Under the new arrangements, people are precluded from putting in claims except under Schedule 4 phasing. The fact that a claim may be put in during the preceding six months does not guarantee that application will be made and if a claim is not made, the initial part of subsection (3) would appear to rule out eligiblity.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the legal language of these Bills is difficult to comprehend, but I assure the right hon. Lady that I have looked at it carefully since our meeting. What I have put in layman's language this morning is the legal effect, and it exactly follows the precedent of the previous occasion.<br><br>
The date when the award becomes eligible will be the date laid down in the commencement orders. We have this six months' period for the taking on of claims in the same way as we had a period before December, 1971. Any person who claims during that period, however long it may take for the process of claim and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0735">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 319</span>
review to take place, will receive payment from the date of the award.<br><br>
I turn now to the extension of the allowance. I want to give the Committee a little more information and answer one or two of the observations by the right hon. Lady. The extension relates to those who require attention. We estimate that there will probably be 500,000 claims—it is difficult to be accurate and there may be more. We also estimate that there will probably be 250,000 awards. Within the four groups, only rough estimates are possible. We estimate 50,000 awards in the working-age group, 50,000 for children, 40,000 for the 67-74 age group, and 90,000 for those aged 75 and over.<br><br>
To bring this scheme into operation will be, by any standards, a major job. Stage one—those entitled to allowance by day and by night, is still being continued even before the Attendance Allowance Board has had much time to absorb the lessons learned from this comparatively new allowance. Indeed, one may say that it has had no breather at all.<br><br>
I am sure that hon. Members will wish to pay tribute to the Attendance Allowance Board, the doctors who work for it and to the lay staff for the magnificent job they have done. I was sorry that the right hon. Lady referred to the lack of humane administration in some instances. By all means let her blame politicians, but I think that the Committee will agree that the Attendance Allowance Board has done a magnificent job of work in bringing this completely new allowance into operation for so many people in such a short time.<br><br>
The right hon. Lady asked me about the terminal cases. The attendance allowance is not specifically designed for terminal cases. One of the criteria laid down for the original allowance and for this is that the need for attendance must have existed for six months previous to a successful award. There is no doubt that because of the comparatively high death rate amongst those who are in receipt of an award, there will be many cases where this allowance is in operation when the people concerned die. It is the six-month criterion, rather than the actual terminal problem, on which the allowance is based at present.<br><br>
I was asked how long it would take to bring the extension into operation. I assure the Committee that everybody con-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 320</span>
cerned—the Government, the Board, the doctors and lay staff who serve on the Board, local general practitioners and others—will use all their dedication and energy to do this job as quickly as possible. But the job has to be done properly and each case requires careful individual attention. It requires a medical report from the general practitioner in the first instance. It requires a great deal of careful consideration at all stages, including, in the case of someone who has applied, the opportunity for that person to see all the papers and comments and to give his reaction before the case is finally decided.<br><br>
We believe that it will take two years from the commencement of the new allowance in December. If we can do better, I assure the Committee that we will. It is for that reason that the bringing into operation of the four groups in stage two will be done by commencement orders.<br><br>
We propose with the first group—the working-age group—that claims will be taken from December, this year, and that payments will begin from 4th June, 1973. That means that people who. claim by 4th June will be paid from that date. We envisage that the last group will become eligible to payment on 2nd December, 1974. I assure the Committee that if we can improve on these dates, we will. We are all anxious that these additions should be brought within the scope of the extended allowance just as soon as it can conceivably be done.<br><br>
The next point, alluded to by the right hon. Lady, is on the phasing of the extension. It is an agonising choice for anybody to have to make, but we have received the help and advice of the Attendance Allowance Board. I am not sheltering behind the Board. The Government have a responsibility to make up their minds on the matter and they have done so. The Board has advised as to the need for phasing and the order in which the groups should be taken, and we have acted on that advice.<br><br>
We know from the experience we have of that allowance already that had we opened the floodgates to perhaps half a million claims coming in at one time, we should almost certainly have ended up with those entitled to the allowance having to wait longer, rather than a shorter period, and that is why it has proved necessary to make that agonising
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0736">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 321</span>
choice, which has been made on the advice of experts.<br><br>
Lord Amulree, the Chairman of the Board, is an extremely experienced and gifted doctor. He is the President of the British Geriatric Society. Members of the Board include a consultant in physical medicine, a psychiatrist, a pediatrician, the honorary director of DIG—tribute has already been paid in the Committee to that worthy organisation—a general practitioner, an assistant director of social services, a consultant chest physician and a medical director of a hospice for terminal illness. That wealth of expertise and experience has advised us as to the need for phasing and to the best ways of doing it. We have accepted that advice, and in the circumstances it is the best way to get the allowance into operation in an orderly fashion, without disappointing expectations, and without people having to wait for long periods.<br><br>
It is equally important that we should have consistency and uniformity of medical standards. The need for the Board to prepare for the new arrangements, to keep track of the existing procedures and claims, and for its members to see a substantial number of them themselves to ensure uniform standards, is most necessary.<br><br>
The right hon. Lady asked about liaison with the BMA and other organisations. I can assure her that it has been close. Before the first stage of the allowance started, the Board wrote to all general practitioners and sent them the appropriate material. It will be doing so again for each group in the extension of the allowance. Letters are to go out to all general practitioners to acquaint them with the new arrangements and to enlist their co-operation. There is the closest liaison between the Board and the delegated medical practitioners who do a good deal of the work both in the various regions and in the central attendance allowance unit at Norcross, near Blackpool.<br><br>
I remind the Committee that the powers of review are extensive. Anybody who is dissatisfied with a decision may appeal for a complete review of the case within three months, when the whole process may be gone through again. After three months, it is possible, under slightly differing conditions, for the case to be looked at again. All members of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 322</span>
Committee probably have personal experience of writing to Norcross, to me, or to my right hon. Friend, and we have ensured that the reviews take place. There are more extensive possibilities of a case being looked at again within the review procedure than within the normal national insurance mechanism for appeals against decisions. The review procedure permits substantial flexibility, which is desirable when a new allowance is introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Madel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Under-Secretary has said about the extent of the time that may be given to review a case, does he feel that there is now a case for the Government to remind the public, through the Press and the other media, that there are a number of ways in which cases may be reviewed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and I assure my hon. Friend that that will happen as part of the publicity arrangements for the extension. With the new extension, four groups will be coming in and there will be publicity at each stage. We shall try to direct the publicity as effectively as we can to those eligible within each six-month period. The review procedure will be one aspect to appear in the material and the leaflets. Not only will people know when to make a claim, but they will have a clear indication of whether they are likely to be in a category, and what happens in the event of their claim being turned down and their wanting a review.<br><br>
Perhaps I may also remind my hon. Friend that we have recently improved the arrangements—we are learning as we go along. Anyone who gets a claim turned down is told clearly, and in simple language, that he has a right to a review, and how to go about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Tom Stuttaford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel) has raised an important topic. The population we are dealing with is a degenerating one, as shown by the very nature of their need for an attendance allowance, whether constant attendance, or attendance by day. Will applicants realise that there will come a time when those originally categorised as needing daytime care only will need night-time care, too? Are we making certain that we shall not leave people for two years, even though at some time during that period they should be phased into the group of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0737">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 323</span>
those who need care constantly throughout the day? That is where we shall slip up. We shall say that they cannot have the night-time care, but must wait two years, and during that two years they will degenerate rapidly, with their families put to considerable expense and they themselves to considerable suffering.</span></p>
<p>11.00 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the point. The day and night criteria will continue. They do not stop because we are extending the new allowance. There will be nothing to prevent anybody who feels that his condition has deteriorated and that he is eligible for the higher allowance from putting in a claim for that. We shall make it as clear as we can in the publicity and in the other arrangements now being worked out.<br><br>
The right hon. Lady referred to the cost of the allowance. The present allowance, including the uprating in the Bill, would cost £25 million in a full year. The extension during 1973–4 for two groups for part of the year will be £11 million. In 1974–75 not all will be in payment for the full year. In 1975–6 all will be in payment for the full year and the cost will be £45 million. By that time the total for both the higher and the lower allowance will be £70 million per year. To put it another way, the allowance started in December, 1971. On present plans, the extension will be completed by December, 1974. In that three-year period the cost will have risen from nil to £70 million a year.<br><br>
I hope that I have dealt with the main points put to me by the right hon. Lady. I will gladly try to answer any other points which any members of the Committee may wish to put.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, but I should like to take up a point made by the Under-Secretary when he referred to what my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) said about the relationship between terminal care and the extension of the attendance allowance. The Under-Secretary kept very carefully to the rules by saying that it was not intended specifically to take account of terminal care and that the six-months criterion was the operative condition, even though it would include people who died, and to that extent it was related to terminal care.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 324</span>
My right hon. Friend made precisely the point that it should relate more specifically to terminal care people because it was these people who were now penalised. If these people die in hospital, all the costs—food, laundry, special diet or lodging—are taken into account. But if a person dies at home, the comparable expenditure has to be met by the family. There is virtually no subsidy for such a family which looks after a patient in a terminal condition. That is an unsatisfactory state of affairs, but I realise that there are problems about dealing with it. Nevertheless we shall require the Government to say how they see the allowance working.<br><br>
According to an answer I had on 15th June, even in the cheapest cases, where hospitals were dealing almost exclusively with geriatric patients, the cost of keeping a patient in hospital was about £30 a week—it was £29.40 in 1970–71, which shows an increase over the last four years of nearly 50 per cent., and there is no reason to suppose that costs will not continue to rise at this alarming rate. In acute care hospitals the costs per patient per week can rise to £100. We are therefore dealing with large sums now being borne by the hospital.<br><br>
If a patient dies at home, there is no help for the family, apart from supplementary benefits, and we are aware of the inadequacies of such benefits, particularly with regard to the little extras which make such a difference to terminal patients—whether it be discretionary additions to special diets, laundry or, in a few cases, the installation of a telephone, even if it is only a temporary connection. To make matters worse, the family is penalised if relatives are prepared to undertake the care of a patient, though where a woman discontinues her employment to look after a sick relative within the family she does at least get stamps at the non-employed rate. But a man gets no stamps paid. That is an anomaly and needs to be rectified. Not only is there a lack of positive assistance, but a financial penalty against men.<br><br>
Although it is a more controversial view, I am sure that many people would agree that a hospital was not the most suitable milieu in which to spend one's time once a terminal condition had been diagnosed. I in no way intend a slur on hospitals, which do their best in the cir-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0738">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 325</span>
cumstances. But there is a limit to the amount of personal care and attention that can be given by them. They are geared to cure; death is an embarrassment to them. I do not suggest that hospitals will not accept people suffering from a terminal diagnosis, but if one is to retain the remedial role of hospitals, which is their prime rôle, one needs to retain the opportunities for higher turnover, and, given the limitation on beds, this can only mean enabling more people with chronic or terminal conditions to be offered at least the choice—which I believe many of them would accept—to die at home.<br><br>
Thus, we are asking whether the attendance allowance cannot be extended in some way to take account of terminal conditions. I appreciate that there are difficulties, the first of which is in establishing what constitutes a terminal diagnosis. For example, there are well known cases of people having survived for much longer than expected, of whom Sir Francis Chichester is only the most famous. However, it is only the exceptions that make the news, and doctors are usually correct in their terminal diagnoses. If some patients appeared to be recovering, there would be no reason why the allowance should not be discontinued. For those reasons, I do not think the difficulty which I have described constitutes a complete block to the provision of some financial aid through the attendance allowance mechanism to patients with terminal conditions.<br><br>
One appreciates that financial assistance is not the only consideration. Perhaps even more important is the domiciliary service during the evening, or preferably at night, to enable the person who is otherwise carrying the whole burden to obtain a few hours' sleep. It is this factor, possibly more than any financial consideration, which often leads to patients finally being admitted to hospital. However, the financial consideration, although not unique, is certainly crucial. Surely we ought not to penalise members of a family when the wife or the husband is prepared to provide this service. Surely it is possible to provide an extension of the attendance allowance.<br><br>
One particular advantage of the attendance allowance is that it is not specifically related to death. Obviously, it would be undesirable, as well as im-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
practicable, to establish a grant specifically related to death. The psychological implications for the family and for the patient would be disastrous. However, an attendance allowance has no such stigmatising and undesirable overtones. For that reason, I hope that the Government will undertake to re-examine the matter and that on Report they will produce further suggestions for tackling the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support that plea. I think that it is necessary to examine the question of a terminal allowance, including its renaming, in much greater detail. Ten years ago, when one was dying one took a long time to do so. Modern medicine aims to keep the patient fit, or half-fit, or third-fit, almost until the end, so that the period during which he will be dying as a true terminal case will be only a matter of weeks, or of one or two months.<br><br>
I am a great believer in private medicine. It has many advantages, including those of privacy, choice and comfort. However, it has few medical advantages, except at the beginning and end of one's life. It is true that the rich can buy a safe entry into the world and can choose to die in cleanliness and dignity. It seems wrong that the beginning and end of a man's mortal span should be determined by his income, but that is the case today.<br><br>
Those of us who practise medicine will know that in most places—although it may not be so in Oldham—it is extremely difficult to get a terminal care patient into hospital. Many hospitals will discharge their terminal care cases during their last few weeks of life to die in squalor, dirt and filth in their own homes. They will be lucky if they have a young family who can care for them. Certainly, the provision under the local health authority is totally inadequate to give them even a modicum of care. If one visits such a patient in the afternoon, after the nurse has visited him in the morning, he will already be lying in a wet, dirty bed, possibly in his own vomit. He will be inadequately fed, since there is no drip arrangement for feeding. He will be left there to die.<br><br>
Some of this hardship could be alleviated if one could persuade a patient's family to look after him. To do this, it is necessary to think in terms of cash. We must re-think the problem of

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 327</span>
terminal care and try to obviate the problem of the six months' period. It must be realised that a family who is giving concentrated care to a dying patient is relieving the State of a burden. It needs all the support we can give.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) and my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford), because this is one of the gaps in the health service which has long needed filling. We realise that there have been other priorities and we also realise that this is a difficult gap to fill. It cannot be anything in the nature of a death allowance, because that comes after the need. The need occurs during the last few days or last months, and no one can tell that that will be the terminal period of a case. The matter presents the Department with great problems. However, it is a gap and I support any exploration into how it should be filled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sydney Bidwell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Under-Secretary sat down, he invited questions. The hon. Gentleman quoted figures and I believe that it will be agreed that the system of appeal on initial turn-down has caused some public alarm. Questions have been asked in the House about the ratio of cases that have succeeded on appeal.<br><br>
I do not suggest that the members of the review body would not work except in the most compassionate and humane way, but there have been large gaps between initial applications and appeals, without any material change in circumstances, Many hon. Members have made representations on the subject. I had a case of a woman with multiple sclerosis and the way in which she was turned down was shameful. She was so severely handicapped that, having fallen, she became stuck between the bath and the toilet until her son came home. Her condition was made perfectly clear on the initial application, but she finally succeeded on appeal with representations from myself and others. There are other disturbing cases. I therefore hope that the background of public anxiety will persuade the Under Secretary to reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Castle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was very disappointed by the Under Secretary's reply this morning. I felt at our last meeting when I raised a number of issues that there was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 328</span>
a warm and sympathetic atmosphere in the Committee. I am sure that all hon. Members realised that I was not trying to make party political points.<br><br>
I accept that the criterion we laid down when we introduced the concept of the attendance allowance in our 1969 Bill was the same as that originally accepted by the Government. We have moved on from that. I was not trying to score or to do any political auctioneering. I felt that I was expressing a disquiet shared by many Committee members. That feeling has been illustrated this morning during our discussion of terminal cases.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
I had hoped that the hon. Gentleman would have thought carefully about the anxieties I expressed before he spoke this morning. In fact, his speech took us not one step further. I can only describe it as a scrappy and perfunctory speech. For example, I made a good deal in my earlier speech of the interpretation of the starting date for eligibility. It is not good enough for the hon. Gentleman, when I remind him of the wording of the Bill, to say, "There is no need for explanations: I merely tell you that I have looked at the wording since the last sitting and I am satisfied that it is all right.<br><br>
He has not convinced me. There have been a remarkable number of instances recently when the Government have put legislation on the Statute Book with certain intentions in mind and the courts have said categorically that, whatever the intentions might have been, the law did not say what was claimed. We shall be giving some interesting illustrations of this when we deal with Clause 5.<br><br>
As the authors of the Industrial Relations Act, can the Government confidently say that if certain wording looks confused and doubtful, it is all right for a Minister to say, "I have satisfied myself". As someone who went through the Committee stage of the Industrial Relations Bill, I assure the Committee that there were dozens of times when we said, "The Clause does not say that", only to have a flow of words from the Solicitor-General to assure us that the Government had certain intentions in mind, and that the evils that we foresaw would not flow from the wording. We know now what a mess we are in be-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0740">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 329</span>
cause of the Industrial Relations Act following different interpretations by the courts.<br><br>
I do not believe that a layman's reading of language will be all that much different from that of the judiciary. I have asked the hon. Gentleman, and he owes more of an explanation to the Committee, how he can make his claim about the effect of the Clause when it contains the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"An attendance allowance shall not be payable … for any period preceding the date on which he makes a claim for it."</p></blockquote>
The only words by which that is qualified are:
<br><blockquote><p>"a claim for an attendance allowance may be made during the period of six months."</p></blockquote>
I should like the hon. Gentleman to give me more chapter and verse than he has to allay my anxiety. There are no lawyer hon, Members on this side of the Committee; I wish there were, for I am satisfied that they would endorse my anxiety.<br><br>
The purpose of a Committee stage is to improve a Bill. I always found when I was a Minister, however carefully I imagined I had thought a Bill through before it reached the Committee Stage, I learned a great deal about my own Bill as a result of examination by Committee members. Ministers must be willing to learn and to amend. We have not had a comma or syllable altered so far.<br><br>
Would it not be possible for the hon. Gentleman to make the position clearer by saying,
<br><blockquote><p>"An attendance allowance shall not be payable to a person for any period preceding the date on which he was entitled by regulations to make a claim."</p></blockquote>
What is wrong with that? Is it unreasonable to suggest that that wording would lift it above all dubiety? Must we have endless litigation, and then a sort of future equivalent of Clause 5 to make the legal position clear because the court says something different from what the Minister wanted it to say?<br><br>
I ask the hon. Gentleman, between now and Report if he likes, to look at this question seriously. All our discussion will be on the record, and he will be held personally accountable if it is found that there is any confusion about the wording of the Bill when it becomes an Act.<br><br>
There is a second matter on which I felt that the Minister's argument was perfunctory. I spoke about the medical interpreta-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 330</span>
tions in relation to the eligibility criteria. I cited a case, and so did my hon. Friend the Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell) to illustrate the argument. I am sure that all hon. Members feel that there has been cause for anxiety in the rulings. It was grossly unfair of the Minister to say that I was attacking the medical authorities as inhumane. I was doing nothing of the kind. I am certainly not attacking the Attendance Allowance Board. I said merely that, just as courts may vary in their interpretations of various wording, so may medical authorities vary in their assessment of the application of a medical criterion.<br><br>
I asked what discussions the Government have had, and how they have indicated their desire about the wording in a medical sense could be interpreted. The only answer given by the hon. Gentleman was that the Attendance Allowance Board had had close liaison with the BMA and with medical practitioners throughout the country. As I understand it, therefore, the Minister has left it to the Attendance Allowance Board. I do not attack the devoted members of that Board. We know that they are people dedicated to the cause of the disabled. As the hon. Gentleman said, a representative of the Disablement Income Group is a member of the Attendance Allowance Board. We all know how she would fight for the cause of the disabled.<br><br>
However, it is again a question of reconciling our own commonsense reaction to some of the cases we meet with the outcome of those cases. There was the astonishing case cited by my hon. Friend the Member for Southall. There is a conflict between our commonsense assessment and what happens in the medical assessment. The hon. Gentleman does not seem to have thought it incumbent on him to reply to the detailed questions I raised, so that the Committee's anxiety might be allayed.<br><br>
We are told that a letter will go out from the Attendance Allowance Board to medical practitioners explaining the new criteria of eligibility. The Minister did not tell us what kind of letter would be sent. He did not tell us what kind of guidance it would give, if any. I ask him to place a copy of that letter in the Library. All hon. Members would like to look at it. We might then be able to help with constructive suggestions on how the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0741">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 331</span>
guidance to medical practitioners could be improved. We should all like to know more about how the case law is being built up on this important sector.<br><br>
While I am on the question of letting hon. Members know what instructions will go out, I turn to the matter raised by the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel). When the Minister said that the powers of review would be extensive, the hon. Gentleman asked him whether he would give publicity to the rights of appeal and so on as part of the extension of the provisions. The Minister said that publicity was being prepared.<br><br>
I have had to deal with a parallel situation in my previous administrative capacity. When the Labour Government put the Equal Pay Act on the Statute Book, there were complaints that the draftsman's language was not as comprehensible as it might to the layman. I undertook to issue a simple guide, which was made extensively available on request to anybody, such as trade union branches, people calling at local employment exchanges, and so on. It was a man and woman's simple guide to their rights under the Equal Pay Act. I personally vetted the wording of the guide. Although I have many inadequacies, a journalistic training is one of my strengths. I was determined to see that that guide was in comprehensible language. It was, above all, designed to encourage people to claim their rights.<br><br>
Will the Under-Secretary place in the Library copies of the publicity material the Government intend to issue? Will he ensure that the coverage of that publicity material is as wide ranging as mine was on the Equal Pay Act? And into whose hands will the publicity material go? Where will it be accessible to the public? Will they be able to get one from the Post Office, will they have to go to an office they may not wish to go into such as the social security office, or will it be available from their doctor? Where will they get it, and who will have access to it? Will it be only the organisations or medical practitioners who will have the material? Will it be freely available to the public at many accessible points of distribution?<br><br>
The hon. Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford) raised an important point when he intervened in the Under-Secretary's speech to ask about cases in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 332</span>
which deterioration has set in. We are thinking here, in particular, of the older persons who have to wait two years, who may have been turned down under the present criterion but whose condition has so deteriorated that they become eligible in the meantime. Have they to wait two years? I should like to know about those cases which have been turned down under the present criterion. There must be those who will qualify under the day or night criterion but who will deteriorate and thus become qualified under the day and night criterion.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Norwich, South asked whether such cases would have to wait two years to become eligible? The Under-Secretary seemed to give a guarantee that those cases could be reviewed at any time. I think I understood his reply. He said that a review of the deteriorating cases could take place immediately—presumably, by jumping the queue.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary expressed his sorrow at the lengthy phasing in and called it an agonising decision. He said that, if the Government could speed it up, they would. May I suggest one simple way in which it could be speeded up—by abolishing the differential between the higher and the lower rates. There would then be no need for review cases.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
There is a further point, and it is sad that the hon. Gentleman did not deal with it at length. On what basis are we entitled to say that on the old criterion, which we all agree was too harsh, one may be entitled to more money than on the new criteria, which we all agree are just? It is odd to put a premium on injustice. Having recognised that we must go further than the old criteria, why do we differentiate by reducing the new cases to a rate of £3.60 instead of a rate of more than £5?<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman did not answer my medical or social arguments, and he gave no justification. We are left to assume that the money ran out, and that that was the only way they could do it. Inevitably, the system will be cluttered up with large numbers of review cases of the kind referred to by the hon. Member for Norwich, South. If everybody was at the higher rate, they would not have to be reviewed.<br><br>
Finally, I come to the terminal cases, about which moving speeches were made
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0742">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 333</span>
from both sides. When the hon. Gentleman reads the records of our proceedings, he is likely to be ashamed at the perfunctoriness of his reply. He did not seem to take on board the arguments which have been put so forcibly, not even the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher), an argument to which he should have listened if he is so interested in money. Money is saved by taking these cases out of hospital and back into the home. Even if the attendance allowance were granted automatically, there would still be savings. He did not deal with the human questions so movingly put forward by the hon. Member for Norwich, South and others. All he said was that the six-months criterion is the one on which eligibility is based.<br><br>
The six-months criterion was in our legislation as well. In the normal way, there is probably good reason for it, although, looking back over our own legislation, I have wondered at our introducing a six-months qualifying period. One can imagine cases other than terminal in which it is difficult to justify. If I were now in the hon. Gentleman's position, having to justify an extension to our 1969 provisions, I should expect to be rigorously cross-examined on the reasons for the six-months qualifying period, and I should have to get some really good answers from my Department. I can imagine meetings with my civil servants to find out whether we were really justified, and we should have some hard discussions. If the hon. Gentleman has had such discussions, he has not done the Committee the courtesy of sharing them. He has not attempted to justify the criterion in the first place, and he has certainly not attempted to justify its application to the terminal cases.<br><br>
We all appreciate that these are tricky administrative questions, but we need only insert at the end of subsection (2), following,
<br><blockquote><p>"that he has satisfied or is likely to satisfy both those conditions …"</p></blockquote>
the words "except as provided by regulations". Obviously, we could not write in, "except in terminal cases". Clearly, that is out; but "except as provided in regulations" would give us time to consider how to express by regulation the right flexibility which would enable us to deal
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 334</span>
with these cases.<br><br>
We might, in the end, decide that it was too difficult, and that the only way would be to make six-months qualifying rule totally unnecessary. At least, we should have given it some thought. As a Committee, a united Committee, we want more thought to be given to it.<br><br>
I plead with the hon. Gentleman to share his thinking with us, to answer the points put to him, and the factual questions. Will he on Report insert an Amendment to the six-months qualifying rule on the lines I have suggested—"except as provided by regulations"? If he found it too difficult, he need not make any regulation; but he would have left himself with some room for manoeuvre. He would leave himself a chance to discuss it with his hon. Friends, and to get medical experience and administrative experience to help him. He might even discuss it with us, and we should do our best to think out something workable. I make that appeal in all sincerity, on behalf, I believe, of the Committee as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to deal with the points which have been raised since I gave the Committee certain information at the beginning of the Sitting.<br><br>
Perhaps I can start with the points raised by the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle). There is no point in my repeating the careful explanation which I gave the Committee on subsection (3) read with subsection (2). I assure the Committee that the combination of subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) and subsection (2), particularly subsection (2)(<i>b</i>), plus the commencing order, provides for a similar arrangement to that which we had to bring the existing allowance into operation. There has been no problem with that, and no litigation of which I am aware. However, I assure the right hon. Lady that I shall look yet again to ensure that the wording of the Bill fully expresses our desire and intention.<br><br>
The right hon. Lady then asked about the publicity arrangements for the extension of the allowance. The Attendance Allowance Board is independent. There are close links between the Government and the Board, and the arrangements for the day-to-day operation are discussed. We have had careful consideration with the Board as to the form of the extension.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0743">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 335</span>
I shall ensure that all possible information is available in the Library so that hon. Members may see it. The Government are anxious to have as much assistance from hon. Members as they possibly can. Members of Parliament can do a great deal to help us with the allowance and to ensure that cases which they think should be reviewed are drawn to the attention of Ministers or sent direct to the Attendance Allowance Board.<br><br>
I shall have to discuss with the chairman of the Board whether it will be appropriate for the actual letters sent out to general practitioners and others to be made available. I am sure that the right hon. Lady will acknowledge that I cannot give a commitment about private letters from the chairman of the Board. But I give an undertaking to ensure that the publicity material is available for hon. Members to see it. Any hon. Members who want copies of that material for their own personal use shall have them. That is something we have always tried to do with social security matters, and it is of particular importance here.<br><br>
The publicity material will be readily available in local offices and the like. Claim forms will be available on application. There will be a campaign using all the usual media when each group in the new extension comes into operation. Special leaflets to assist doctors, social workers and interested voluntary organisations will be made available, so that they will know what the new conditions are and when the various groups of people will become eligible. Letters from the Attendance Allowance Board will go out to doctors and directors of social service, to those most concerned on the ground in bringing the allowance into operation. I hope that that covers the publicity arrangements.<br><br>
The right hon. Lady asked about those who are turned down. They may apply for a review within the normal arrangements laid down; for the first three months with no qualifications whatsoever, and after three months with the medical practitioners concerned deciding whether there is a case for review. That can be done at any time. Equally, anyone on the lower rate of allowance—one of the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford)—if he feels that his condition has deteriorated so that he will be eligible for the higher rate of allowance, may apply
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 336</span>
for it. There is no need to wait until the end of a two-year period or anything of that kind. He may apply straight away and the claim for the higher rate of allowance will be looked at.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
A number of hon. Members raised the matter of terminal cases. I shall gladly respond to the point put by the right hon. Lady and see whether there is sufficient flexibility within the Bill. I shall do that between now and Report, although I cannot give any commitment now. I take her point that we want the legislation to be in such a form that eventualities which we may not have foreseen can be dealt with speedily and effectively.<br><br>
I have to sound two warning notes about the possibility of bringing terminal cases within the new allowance. The hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) was on a good point when he told the Committee that the last thing we want is a "death warrant" type grant. We do not want to identify terminal cases by the receipt of a specific allowance which clearly marks them down as such. Those in receipt of the allowance under the six months criteria are covered already.<br><br>
I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South, but were we to cover those in whose case the terminal period is far less, we should be changing the character of the allowance. I am not saying that we should not do that in due course, and I am certainly not closing my mind to it, but at the moment the allowance is based on the concept of attendance of a fairly substantial character being required over a period of six months before anyone becomes eligible for it at all. The Committee is saying that we should change the character of the allowance in certain specific cases, of which terminal cases have been given as one example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Castle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman able to give the Committee a rough estimate of the cost of not having the six-months qualifying period at all? Does he know how much that would add?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot off the cuff. It would be the difference between paying the allowance from day one and paying it six months later. I have no figure for that off the cuff, but I shall try to provide the information on a later occasion.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0744">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 337</span>
The Committee are saying, in effect, that we should change the character of the allowance. I hope that it is not saying that this should be done on top of the regular work which the Attendance Allowance Board has already. We must give the Board a chance to do the major job involved before asking it to take on additional cases, or before we consider changing the character of the allowance. But, in response to what has been said, I shall gladly consider whether the legislation is sufficiently wide to provide for these eventualities in due course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does what the Minister has said mean that, even if the Government are prepared to proceed along the lines suggested by hon. Members on both sides, they are not prepared to do it before the end of 1974, or possibly 1975?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that it seems wise to bring the next stage of the allowance into operation before we consider changing its character—which is what it would mean if the allowance were to cover a period before the six-months need for attention had been established. At the moment the allowance is based on the long-term need for attention and supervision. Before considering an extension and a change in the character of the allowance, it would be wise to bring into operation the next stage, and to include the 250,000 or so people in substantial need of attention on a long-term basis, for periods of over six months, before considering further.<br><br>
The other point is that many of those provided with care and attention as terminal cases in their own homes are eligible for other allowances. There are pensions, sickness benefits, and possibly disability benefits within the national insurance schemes. In many cases, they are receiving cash help already, and the local authority social service departments provide services of various kinds. Assistance is available. We are all entirely sympathetic to providing the best possible home conditions for terminal cases. Often, from the point of view of the patient and the relatives, it is the best way in which such cases can be cared for. I am not ruling out the powerful pleas which have been made, and I have undertaken to examine the matter, but I ask the Committee not to overburden the Attendance Allowance
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 338</span>
Board at a time when it is taking on the major task of bringing in new categories of people who, it is felt, should benefit from the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend not only for giving way but for his slight assurance. However, I think that he is confusing two different problems. The terminal case is a separate problem rather than an extension of the problem of long-term supervision necessary for the chronically sick. Very often, the terminal case is a short case, and I disagree with him that the local authority can cope with such cases.<br><br>
Would my hon. Friend comment also on the question of pensions? We all know that these people are leading an inadequate life, already as poor as church mice, living on their pension. In these tragic cases, when they are as poor as church dying mice, the pension is totally inadequate to the stress placed upon it. We should not put any credence on the suggestion that they will have other funds. Those funds do not stretch to the care needed when a patient is dying. This is a different problem, an urgent problem, and one which cannot wait.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute what my hon. Friend says. However, I am saying that, where the terminal case is for a comparatively short period, it falls outside the allowance as it is envisaged at present. My hon. Friend has asked me to extend the allowance, and to change its character. I do not claim that that should not be done. Nevertheless, to overload the Attendance Allowance Board at this time would achieve a result that none of us wants, namely, the delaying of the process of extending the allowance to those cases which it is hoped to cover.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell) asked about the ratio of successes in the review procedures. I freely admit that in the early days, when everyone was learning about the allowance, a substantial number of cases were not successful on first application but were successful on review. But that proves the value of the review procedure. Particularly in the early days, the Attendance Allowance Board and its delegated medical practitioners had to build up common standards. The review procedure represented one of the best ways to achieve such standards. As a result, 60 per cent. of the reviews have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0745">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 339</span>
been successful, a fact which illustrates the value of such a procedure.</span></p>

CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER NATIONAL INSURANCE ACT 1965</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian O'Malley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 84, in page 5, line 22, after "1971", insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"provided that where contributions are paid by an expectant or nursing mother after the due date for the sole purpose of qualifying for maternity grant the amount of each such contribution shall be 1p unless regulations otherwise provide and such contributions shall be treated for any other purpose as not paid."</p></blockquote>
The form of the Amendment may appear to be rather complicated, considering its simple purpose. However, the responsibility for its complicated form lies with the Government, since the Long Title makes virtually impossible the amendment of the Bill in the way we should have wished.<br><br>
The purpose of the Amendment is to ensure that all expectant mothers receive the maternity grant, regardless of their own contribution record or that of their husbands. The Committee will note that we are not seeking to open loopholes by which contributors may avoid the payment of contributions which they should have made in the past. For that reason, after the word "1p" we have added the words,
<br><blockquote><p>"unless regulations otherwise provide …"</p></blockquote>
The present rules stipulate that either the woman or her husband should have made 26 contributions to the national insurance fund during the preceding year. This is not, in itself, an onerous contribution requirement. Nevertheless, the previous Government, during consideration of the National Superannuation Bill, when looking at the payment of this type of grant, took the view that the contribution conditions ought to be simplified and made even less onerous than was the case at that time—and as remains the case, since that Bill failed to complete its passage through the House as a result of the 1970 General Election.<br><br>
Why should one seek to change the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 340</span>
conditions on which the payment of maternity grant is made? I am sure that the Minister will be quick to point out that maternity grants have been paid under contributions ever since the National Insurance Act, 1911, so there is a long history of a contribution demand before grant is payable. It is true also that the National Insurance Advisory Committee, which examined this problem in 1952 and reported in Cmd. 8446, recommended that, while maternity benefits should remain insurance benefits, it was appropriate that some kind of contribution conditions be attached to this type of benefit, as to others.<br><br>
However, that Report of the National Insurance Advisory Committee did not consider the more fundamental question whether maternity benefits should remain insurance benefits, or whether they should be treated differently. The Committee pointed out merely that, while they remain insurance benefits, some kind of contribution conditions should be attached. Thus, it was decided, 20 years ago, that in all the circumstances some kind of contribution conditions should prevail.<br><br>
It may be argued that there have been significant social changes and changes in social habits since that time. Also, the Government have in the interim introduced the attendance allowance, an allowance to which no contribution conditions attach since it is recognised that it is an allowance designed to meet extra expenses. The attendance allowance, in similar form, was introduced by the Labour Administration. Thus, there is no difference between the parties on the form of allowance.<br><br>
If one were seeking illustrations of benefits which are not tied to contribution conditions, one could point out that family allowances are payable not as insurance benefits and without contribution conditions simply because they meet extra expenses. They are of a type which may be set aside as different from the normal type of insurance benefit which becomes payable after contributions have been made for a certain length of time.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
The major argument in favour of getting rid of contribution conditions for maternity benefit stems from an examin-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0746">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 341</span>
ation of the categories of people currently excluded. However, I should be out of order to pursue that argument in great detail, and we are driven to moving an Amendment which keeps some contribution conditions, but as small as could be devised to meet the Long Title of the Bill. Thus, the Amendment reads,
<br><blockquote><p>"… paid by an expectant or nursing mother after the due date for the sole purpose of qualifying for maternity grant the amount of each such contribution shall be 1p unless regulations otherwise provide and such contributions shall be treated for any other purpose as not paid."</p></blockquote>
It is true that in a large number of cases the contribution conditions are easy enough to ensure that maternity grant is payable. The number of maternity grants paid in any one period when set against the Registrar-General's figures for live or still births show that over 95 per cent. of such mothers receive a maternity grant.<br><br>
We are talking, therefore, about less than 5 per cent. If the Government felt able to give way on this matter, they would not incur enormous additional expenditure. This is always a source of worry to the hon. Gentleman, because he wants to be able to save enough money so that Tory Chancellors of the Exchequer may make available stock option schemes or hand out hundreds of millions of pounds to those sections of the population which are the most wealthy and need assistance least.<br><br>
If the Amendment were accepted, there would not be a vast additional number of people receiving maternity grant, creating new additional expense for the Government. In any case, a proportion of the 4½ or 5 per cent. already receive some kind of maternity benefit, although in some cases after the birth rather than before, through supplementary benefits.<br><br>
Who are the small minority here? Whom are we excluding from maternity grant under the present contribution conditions, which the previous Government sought to make considerably easier? First there are the school girl mothers or young girls who have never worked, or who have no husbands, or have husbands who have made no contributions during the relevant year. Very often, these girls become the financial responsibility of heads of families who themselves are not well off. Of course, there will be girls
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 342</span>
from families for whom the financial implications of such a situation will not be disastrous; but for a substantial number that will not be so.<br><br>
The second category of women not entitled to maternity grant under existing contribution conditions are common law wives, I had such a case about 12 months ago. A divorced woman had a child while living as a common law wife. Within days, she married the man with whom she was living. She was extremely angry, as was her husband, to find that she was not entitled to a maternity benefit. Whatever general arguments may be used about that type of case—it is not my responsibility to consider the implications of the broader moral issues—where people are often living in restricted financial circumstances, there is a case for including such people within the maternity grant arrangements.<br><br>
The third category likely to be caught under the present arrangements are students or those only very recently in employment.<br><br>
The fourth category are pregnant women married to men in prison who, during the relevant financial contribution year, have made no contributions. Prisoners are not credited with contributions and, therefore, such a married woman could find herself without a maternity grant.<br><br>
The Under Secretary may say that many such people may apply for and receive help through supplementary benefits. I know that that is so, but I reply in this way. Wherever possible, we should push back the area of means testing. We should not involve ourselves in additional expenditure if we took off the shoulders of the Supplementary Benefits Commission the need to consider the advisability of making a maternity payment. We should not have argument as to whether a maternity payment should be made before the birth of the child or afterwards. Although I know that it is the policy of the Supplementary Benefits Commission to make the payment before the birth of the child rather than afterwards—I say at once that I have no case on my files to indicate otherwise—I understand that occasionally there are difficulties, when payments are held back from applicants until after the birth of the child.<br><br>
It would be helpful if that job were taken from the Supplementary Benefits Commission altogether. One hears so
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0747">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 343</span>
often of overwork among supplementary benefit officers, of under-staffing, and of high turnover of staff. Wherever possible, without incurring substantial extra cost, we should move from the means test to a more general system without means testing. It will be easier to administer. It makes the administration much tidier.<br><br>
But, apart from the argument that we should try to drive back the area of means testing, and the question of additional cost, in the circumstances of 1972, with the experience of more than half a century of the administration of the national insurance system behind us, and with the example of attendance and family allowance payments, I ask the Committee to accept the Amendment. It is not a party-political point. We should ensure that anyone expecting a child could as of right be entitled to the grant. It seems ludicrous in 1972 that the situation should be otherwise.<br><br>
It would not be damaging to the contributory principle if the Amendment were accepted. I know that the hon. Gentleman, when he considered the matter in correspondence—I have seen the correspondence which he had with Mr. Tony Lynes, a social worker involved in this area—felt at that time that he could not agree to the Government changing the existing conrtibution system. But I hope that we shall have the opportunity in the Committee to reconsider the matter, with speeches from both sides. It is not a major matter, though it is one of some principle. I believe that it would be the sensible and right thing to do in 1972, and I therefore hope that the Minister and the Committee will consider the Amendment sympathetically.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. O'Malley) has moved the Amendment in his usual convincing way. This is the type of Amendment for which, considered in isolation a strong case can be made. The difficulty—the hon. Gentleman nows it well, because he has been in this chair himself—is that one has to consider not only the case for such Amendments on their individual merits but the effects and ramifications for other contributors and beneficiaries under the scheme. Looked at in that way, difficulties and problems arise.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman said, the concept of maternity grant as an insurance benefit goes back to the National Insur-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 344</span>
ance Act, 1911. The effect of the Amendment would enable an expectant or nursing mother, entitled to pay contributions in her own right, to pay contributions after the due date at the rate of 1p towards any deficiency in her contribution record needed to entitle her to payment of maternity grant. The hon. Gentleman is, in effect, proposing a token payment to complete the contributions record so that there is entitlement to benefit.<br><br>
At present a woman may qualify for maternity grant either on her own, or, if she is married, on her husband's insurance. In either case, 26 flat-rate contributions in any class must have been paid before the week in which the baby was expected or before the day on which it was born. In addition, 26 contributions must have been paid or credited in the contribution year governing title to benefit. If one or both of those conditions is not satisfied, any outstanding contributions will still count if they are paid after the due date but within three months after the date of confinement. Any contributions the claimant may wish to pay are normally paid at the lowest flat-rate contribution rate, namely, Class 3 or non-employed rate, which for a woman would be 94p.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
In other words, as the hon. Gentleman fairly explained, the contribution conditions for the grant are favourable in that payments may be made after the contingency has arisen, which, of course, is unusual in this scheme, and in insurance generally. I believe that the scheme has already gone a long way towards establishing favourable contribution conditions for the receipt of maternity grant.<br><br>
If one were to go the whole hog, which, broadly speaking, is what the hon. Gentleman is proposing, what would be the ramifications for other allowances? The hon. Gentleman drew what he thought was a parallel between the new attendance allowance, which is tax-free and non-contributory, and the maternity grant. The difference is that the likelihood of maternity can be foreseen, and it may be insured for in that sense. But this is not so in the case of severe disability and chronic illness for which the attendance allowance is intended to provide. The parallel is, therefore, not close.<br><br>
The proposal in the Amendment would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0748">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 345</span>
be inequitable in respect of certain claimants to maternity grant, and it could raise the question of special treatment for other sections of the insured population. It might be said, if it were done in this area, why not for persons in receipt of sickness benefit, or those who had narrowly missed eligibility to sickness benefit? That is one instance of questions which could fairly be raised by other contributors to the national insurance scheme. If the Amendment were accepted, bringing about a modest change, substantial changes could arise for the contribution conditions in the national insurance scheme as a whole.<br><br>
That is one difficulty. Another difficulty is that not only would it differentiate between claimants to maternity grant and claimants to other benefits, but it would differentiate between different types of women in receipt of the maternity grant itself. There would be the anomaly, for example, of a married woman paying contributions in her own right and able to make good a contribution deficiency by minimal payments at any time, in contrast to the husband of a woman who had elected not to pay contributions herself, who would then need to pay standard rate contributions, within a strict time limit, to obtain the same benefit. It would mean also that women who paid their contributions late would be having a substantial advantage over those who paid their contributions on time. Those are some of the difficulties which would arise if the hon. Gentleman's proposals were adopted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That last objection could be overcome through regulations. I refer particularly to what is said in the Amendment,
<br><blockquote><p>"ߪ unless regulations otherwise provide and such contributions shall be treated for any other purpose as not paid."</p></blockquote>
That phrase, "unless regulations otherwise provide", was deliberately inserted to leave a way for dealing with the kind of case referred to by the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that argument, and I appreciate that that is why the proviso was inserted, to deal with an anomaly which would otherwise occur between the married woman paying on her own contributions and a wife who has elected not to pay contributions. But it would not deal with the additional point I made, that it would put those who paid
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 346</span>
their contributions on time at a disadvantage in comparison with those who paid late. I believe that wide questions would arise, not only in regard to this benefit but throughout the whole national insurance scheme.<br><br>
However, as the hon. Gentleman knows", the contribution arrangements for the basic scheme are subject to review at present. The review was foreshadowed in "Strategy for Pensions", and, although, naturally, I cannot give any commitment on what the effect will be on this particular benefit, I can tell him that we are considering both contributions and conditions, and the general structure of the reformed scheme as foreshadowed in that White Paper. I have previously considered the question—the hon. Gentleman referred to my correspondence with Mr. Tony Lynes—and I shall consider again the points which he has put to me today; but I cannot give any firm commitment.<br><br>
The other leg of the hon. Gentleman's argument was based on an attempt to identify the people who were not covered. He mentioned the schoolgirl mother, the common law wife and the student. These people may be assisted by the Supplementary Benefits Commission. The biggest group is that of the schoolgirl mother and the illegitimate birth. This is one of the problems coming within the terms of reference of the Finer Committee. It would be wise to see what guidance, if any, the Finer Committee will give on the problem before dealing with this specific aspect in isolation.<br><br>
For that comparatively small number of people not covered and not able to take advantage of making up their contributions so that they may obtain cover, there is the system available through the Supplementary Benefits Commission and the exceptional needs arrangements, providing cash for the birth of a child if the Commission feels that the cash is required.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman accepting that in terms of cost there probably is not much in it? The cost of operating the supplementary benefits system, the number of civil servants required, and the fact that there are few cases might give substance to the argument for the need for a change. The Under-Secretary says that it has stood the test of time since 1911, but there has been</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0749">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 347</span>
<p>a change in social patterns and people are not so outraged now when a single girl gives birth to a baby.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in no way expressing a moral judgment and nor am I arguing the cost. I cannot give the Committee an estimate of what the cost of the Amendment would be. It is too speculative to give a meaningful figure. I am certainly not arguing on the grounds of cost. The cost involved would not be great, although I cannot give a precise figure. We do not know how many people would take advantage of the offer which the hon. Gentleman is trying to make to them. We do not know how many people would still go to the Supplementary Benefit Commission to get help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand the hon. Gentleman, though I am grateful for his acknowledgement that the costs would be small. To put the proposition simply: we know that just under 5 per cent. of women giving birth do not receive maternity grant. Therefore, if from the last financial year we estimated the number of births and multiplied it by the cost of the maternity grant and subtracted the cost of the amount paid out by way of supplementary benefits during that period, we should arrive at an approximate figure. I do not understand the difficulty. An estimate could be worked out by the Department, which has access to all the figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not arguing on grounds of cost. There are a good many speculative factors involved, for one would have to make too many assumptions. Therefore, I do not think that a figure could be regarded as meaningful, especially when, like me, the hon. Member does not regard this as in any way central to the issue involved.<br><br>
Having ventilated the issue, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel that the majority of people he has referred to are covered already. These are highly favourable contribution conditions. The Finer Committee is looking at some aspects of this problem and the contri-</span></p>

<p>bution conditions are subject to review anyway in the wider issue of pensions. In the light of that, I hope that he will feel that this discussion has served a useful purpose, for which I am grateful, and that he will not wish to press his Amendment.</p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his reply. He has said that the cost of implementing the Amendment would be small. He has said also that the Government are considering in their general review of pensions the whole question of contribution conditions for this benefit as well as others. He has also said that the Finer Committee should be making some recommendations on the largest single group of people who do not receive the maternity grant, namely, schoolgirls.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman has given a reasonable reply, but he has not said anything which could influence the Committee to decide to wait. In terms of cost. this is a small Amendment. Some of the anomalies which the hon. Gentleman has mentioned could be dealt with by regulations. We are grateful that the Government are considering the future, but they could have taken a tentative step during consideration of the Bill.<br><br>
Therefore we hope that in future we shall see an improvement in the conditions in which maternity benefits are paid without contribution conditions. Nevertheless, to place our view on record I recommend my hon. Friends to support the Amendment to ensure that help is given by the Government in the interim period before the Finer Committee reports and before its recommendations are enshrined in a Bill. I appreciate the manner in which the hon. Gentleman has replied to the Amendment but I suggest that the Committee expresses a view on the Amendment by a vote.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put</i>, That the Amendment be made:</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 8.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0750">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 349</span>
<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the contribution Clause, the money Clause, the Clause we cannot amend because the Government have drafted the Long Title in such a way that we cannot do so. I do not believe that the Government drafted it in ignorance: they know what they have done. It therefore ill becomes the Minister or his backbenchers to complain when Opposition Members move Amendments to increase benefits but are unable to table the necessary Amendments to pay for the benefits.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) made it clear what the policy of the Labour Party and the National Council of Labour is, not only in terms of benefits we believe should be payable during a period of rampant inflation, but also the manner in which the money should be raised to pay for those benefits. We have heard a number of comments, not only from the Minister, but from backbench Members, complaining that although the Opposition have been asking for benefits costing hundreds and millions of pounds, they have not suggested Amendments seeking to put up contributions, or to raise the money in another way. When hon. Gentlemen made those complaints they knew that we should be unable to move such Amendments because of the deliberately restrictive drafting of the Long Title by the Minister and his Department.<br><br>
We are driven to discuss the matter in the "Clause stand part" debate because we cannot get the kind of Amendments we seek. Once again Parliament is being damned. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition on the Floor of the House yesterday, opening his speech on industrial relations, pointed out that as a result of current legislation we were unable to discuss matters of industrial relations. We are put under further intolerable restrictions by EEC legislation and now we are faced with the Under-Secretary doing exactly the same. We cannot move the Amendments because of the way in which he has instructed the Long Title to be drafted.<br><br>
Not being able to draft the Amendments we wish, we must complain at the Exchequer contribution when wage and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 350</span>
salary earners, within the normal range of incomes, are meeting great difficulties because of the inflationary policies of the Government—many of them are on short time working. It also affects the national insurance fund and the amount brought into the fund. Many people are out of work altogether and are making no contribution to the national insurance fund, making it even more difficult to raise the money which is necessary to pay decent benefits to retirement pensioners and other beneficiaries under the National Insurance Act.<br><br>
I return to the subject of the Exchequer contribution. There is no reason why the Exchequer contribution should be at the level of 18 per cent. I know that the Under-Secretary, who in the previous Parliament sat where I am sitting when we were considering the Crossman superannuation scheme, can point out that in 1969 the intention of the Labour Government was to maintain the Exchequer contribution at about 18 per cent. That is true. However, the circumstances in 1971–72 are different. I am not talking about only the conditions of the pensioners, but the financial and economic circumstances are such that the Exchequer should make a bigger contribution to support retirement pensioners and other national insurance beneficiaries at a time when prices are rapidly rising.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman nods his head. I will give way to him immediately, because I like to see the Government Whips making a contribution to the debates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Fortescue</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The Crossman Bill proposed alterations in the levels of pensions over the next 30 years. It was introduced on the basis that a Labour Government would be elected in 1970 and for some time to come. Is the hon. Gentleman now saying that during the whole of the life of those Labour Governments which never happened the economic conditions in this country would continue to be restricted and, if so, could he not admit that that was because there would have been a Labour Government in power and not a Conservative Government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can see the result of two years' incarceration in the Whip's office on the hon. Gentleman. He used to make intelligent speeches and ask acute questions. Something has gone wrong with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0751">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 351</span>
the hon. Gentleman. I used to play the piano, but I have not done so for years, and perhaps I could not play as I used to. The hon. Gentleman may have similar difficulties. His comments do not seem to arise out of anything I have said.<br><br>
All I said was that in the circumstances of 1971–72, at a time when the Chancellor should decide his priorities—there are just under a million unemployed—he should decide which is the right way to spend the money; whether to give it entirely to the wealthier sections of the community, or to give a higher priority, through payment from the Exchequer, to retirement pensioners and other recipients of benefits under the national insurance system.<br><br>
Any fair-minded individual not bound by the dogmatic party politics which are damning the efforts of the Government and the Opposition nowadays would see that the answer was clearly that additional Exchequer assistance could be given, and should have been given earlier. I pointed out in a recent speech that the Exchequer contribution had not always been 18 per cent. There is no magic in that figure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Marsden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Scotland (Mr. Marsden) dealt with this subject in a contribution the other day. In 1948–49, the total Exchequer payment was 32.9 per cent. of flat rate contributions. There has always been some form of Exchequer support for schemes of contributory benefits although the form and extent have varied from benefit to benefit. The original schemes were limited in scope and generally covered lower paid manual workers, so that a subvention from the State was seen to be natural, but over the years there grew the doctrine that the State should play its part in schemes of social insurance. That part has never been closely defined or quantified. The history of Exchequer contributions and supplements of one kind or another during the period since 1946 shows that there have been substantial changes during that period.<br><br>
I will not weary the Committee with a table of statistics—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Marsden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, my hon. Friend knows them. The Minister cer-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 352</span>
tainly knows them. I think I have made my general contention with hon. Members opposite, who are anxious to contribute to the debate, that these Exchequer contributions have varied during the entire post-war period.<br><br>
More recently, the Exchequer supplement as a percentage of total contributions—both flat rate and graduated—in 1961–62 was 20.4 per cent., falling from 19 per cent. down to 18 per cent. by the end of that decade. Thus, there is no philosophical or financial reason why the Exchequer supplement should not be varied.<br><br>
The Committee should bear in mind that such variations, effectively employed, could prove an extremely useful method of achieving re-distribution. The national insurance scheme is currently a re-distribution from the working population to the retired population. We should ask whether there is any reason why we should not seek to achieve re-distribution from the wealthier towards the retired and poorer. In those circumstances, we are entitled to protest to the Minister about the Treasury's meanness in this context and the Department's failure to reflect the importance of its function by fighting for an increased Exchequer contribution in the Bill.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
Secondly, does not the Clause show that the system is just about incomprehensible in 1972? We started with a flat-rate system. Subsequently, because that system was not dynamic and lacked the inbuilt dynamism which moved as wage levels moved, the then right hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames, now Lord Boyd-Carpenter, introduced the graduated pension scheme which initiated the system of payments over bands of income. The present system therefore consists of varying flat-rate contributions, dependent upon age and sex and with the facility for opting out in some cases. There are graduated contributions in a number of bands, some of which are used for varying purposes. In addition, there is the ½ per cent. graduated contribution for earnings-related sickness benefit, which is paid whether or not a contributor has opted out of the flat-rate scheme since it is administratively impossible for him not to pay it if he is paying earnings-related contribution over another band.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0752">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 353</span>
If one asked the average person how the national insurance contribution system worked, he would not be able to explain it.<br><br>
Thus, it is high time for a change. I hope that this is the last Bill in which we shall prop up a system which is not only incomprehensible, but unfair, in that the lower paid who pay flat-rate contributions are being asked to make an unfair contribution in terms of their total income compared with those who are better-off.<br><br>
Both sides of the Committee are agreed upon the need to change the system which we are continuing to prop up by the Bill. However I warn the hon. Gentleman—and this is the direction which the Bill is taking—that the Government, in introducing a system whereby benefits which are largely flat-rate are to be financed out of contributions which are entirely earnings related, would face a great deal of trouble in the country, and would certainly encounter strong opposition from the Labour Benches if this principle were to be introduced. The Minister will recall that the Federation of Professional Workers, representing a large body of workers' opinion, has said that it would regard with strong disfavour any system which sought to take in earnings-related contributions and pay out only flat-rate benefits. Clause 3 is another step in the direction of establishing precisely that kind of system to which my right hon. and hon. Friends and I object.<br><br>
I can well understand the reasons for introducing it. The Clause takes a number of steps by stealth to introduce the principle of earnings-related contributions for flat-rate benefits. I would tell the hon. Gentleman that that is understood, for the purposes of this year. However, on the broader aspect of policy, we are opposed to the full implementation of any such system.<br><br>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) mentioned in an earlier contribution, we should also have wished to raise the employers' contribution. Such an Amendment has not been put down on the later Schedules, because it was not considered useful to do so without also tabling Amendments to raise the rest of the money by the formula which my right hon. Friend mentioned. However, the hon. Gentleman should be in no doubt that my right hon. Friends
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 354</span>
and I consider that in the circumstances in which the Bill was envisaged, a greater priority should have been given to pensioners than to other sectors of the community, and that help should have been granted this year through an increased Exchequer contribution. Secondly, we fundamentally oppose the long-term objective of the Government, mirrored in the Clause, to establish a system based on earnings-related contributions and flat-rate benefits, as will the vast majority of people when the procedure is brought to their attention.<br><br>
Thus, as we were unable to move the Amendments which we should like to have discussed this morning, my right hon. and hon. Friends and I thought it right to comment strongly on this situation during the "Clause stand part" debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall keep the Committee for a few moments to reinforce the argument by my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. O'Malley). Outside observers of this debate would find it curious that, in spite of the weight and cost of the Amendments we have proposed, we have not put into Amendment form any ideas on how to pay for it. We have occupied the time of the Committee and had a thorough-going debate but Clause 3 gives us an opportunity to ventilate the issue again.<br><br>
I have a specific question for the Under-Secretary. My hon. Friend referred to the Exchequer contributions to national insurance funds which now stand at about 18 per cent. and have stood at around that figure for a time. My hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) and others have suggested that the Government intend to drop that percentage to under 15 per cent. In an earlier debate, when we were considering the problem of a substantial improvement in old-age pensions, we heard about 25 per cent., and my hon. Friend said that some people proposed a 25 per cent. Exchequer contribution.<br><br>
Has that sum been costed as meeting the TUC's proposals? I should not expect a Conservative Government to be a slavish adherent to TUC views—the Prime Minister has another meeting with the TUC very soon, it was reported on my car radio this morning—but as the TUC speaks for a substantial section of the working population and holds tested and realistic views, those views must weigh

heavily with any Government.<br><br>
The Economic Review for 1972 draws attention to the need to put up old-age pensions by the substantial sum that we propose in our Amendment, rapidly overtaken since that review was printed by galloping inflation. If one were to sit down to do it today, one might rethink it, since the figures are out of date because of that rapidity. The Review suggests 19/20ths from State and employers and the rest from employee contributions, which it accepts would have to rise under such a formula to get the kind of payout envisaged. Would the Minister have some regard to that when he comes to reply?<br><br>
There is the usual hoary old yarn about where the money is to come from. We know about the limitations to tapping the rich. We know that in real economic terms that is not all that ordinary working people think it is. The TUC has ideas about that, and the Labour Party has talked about a wealth tax on estates worth over £50,000—I believe the TUC's figure was £20,000. There are some who hold the view that Britain tops the inequality league in the kind of society we have developed, in spite of having had Labour Governments for some time. The time has come to reverse the engines, and the people are ready for it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall gladly respond to the comments made by the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. O'Malley) who was, I am sure, speaking of the Money Resolution with his tongue somewhat in his cheek since he will recollect Bills with his name to them for which the Money Resolution was drawn in the form in which it is drawn for the Bill. I need say no more about that.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman said, this is an important Clause, putting up the contributions which pay for a substantial part of the improvement in the benefits to be provided. The hon. Gentleman did not ask me to go into a great deal of detail and I shall not weary the Committee other than to remind hon. Members
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 356</span>
that almost the entire increase in the contribution is on the earnings-related contribution and not the flat-rate contribution. The employer is to pay more on the flat-rate contribution, but nobody with earnings of less than £18 a week is to pay any addition at all. That is the significance of the improvements to be made in the benefits and the way in which the costs are to be spread.<br><br>
There is no magic in an 18 per cent. Exchequer contribution, and I have never said that there was. One has to take into account that the distribution of cost between employees in this fairer way, taking out as far as possible the regressive element within the contributions system, is one of the factors to be put on the other side of the scale when considering the level of the Exchequer contribution. There is no magic in it and I accept the point which was made about that.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman talked about the earnings-related contribution for flat-rate benefits. We accept that the existing pension must be paid in the fairest way by the existing working generation. In that sense we are more realistic and perhaps more redistributive than the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
