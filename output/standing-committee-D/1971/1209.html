	<p>Amendment No. 26, in page 2, line 28, at end, insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>(10A) The boroughs and urban districts listed in Schedule 2 existing immediately before 1st April 1974 shall on that day become and continue to exist as parishes in accordance with the following provisions:
	<ol>

and new Clause No. 1—	<i>Communities.</i></p>
	<p>I should also draw the Committee's attention to the fact that in addition to those Amendments already selected for debate, we shall also consider Amendment No. 257, in Clause 10, page 5, line 36, at end insert:

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evelyn King</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In attempting to conclude my speech on Tuesday evening, I am aware that I was speaking at the rate of a machine-gun, as I believed it to be the wish of the Committee that we should conclude our proceedings at 7.30. However, I spoke so quickly that I am afraid I was not wholly understood. In column 307 of the OFFICIAL REPORT, the omission of the word "not" has made my argument appear to be the direct opposite to that intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I tell the hon. Gentleman that we are having difficulty in hearing him from the platform? Possibly that is the reason for the mistake occurring in the Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. King</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Line 5 of column 307 should read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"will not create the troubles suggested",</p></blockquote>
while in line 10 of column 307, the figure 30,000 should read 20,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had also mentioned—in a spirit of nostalgia as it may appear to some members of the Committee, which I should subsequently disclaim—the high officials in the town of Wareham, who bear the attractive titles of chimney peepers, ale tasters, canisters, scavengers, and so on. When legislation was introduced in the middle of the 19th century to deal with public services, the Ministers of the day did not think it necessary to abolish the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>315</span>
more ancient titles. I do not think anyone would argue that on that account the modern legislation was the less efficient because the older titles were retained, and I should therefore ask my hon. Friends to bear that example in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to make a plea for the retention of the word "parish" as against the word "town" or "borough" or "neighbourhood community", on two counts. First, I believe that the word attracts the sense of neighbourhood that we want to preserve, and second, it makes perfectly clear that the community which bears that name is subordinate in character, and not equal to any town, district or any other word which might be used to describe a superior authority. I believe that it also makes easier the retention of the word "mayor", since the mayor of a parish can then be, and can be seen to be, a person of slightly less consequence than is the mayor of the larger district in which the parish is situated. A possible solution may be for the term "parish-mayor" to be hyphenated. Thus my plea is for the retention of the dignity, while making clear where the ultimate power resides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish, as usual, to make a modest contribution, and I shall attempt to be brief, in view of the time factor. However, in the light of my experience in the constituency of West Hull I should like to make a solid contribution on the subject of the urban parish. We have play centres, and many other means whereby young people can be sensibly employed, rather than wandering the streets indulging in forms of hooliganism. I believe that to be most important, in view of an occurrence in one particular play centre, where local youths attacked with stones the windows of the centre, which was being used as a club by cyclists from all over the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a feeling on the housing estate in question that little is going on. It may well be therefore, that when the young people saw an outside body using their play centre they felt, "Who are these outsiders coming amongst us?" I should like to plead for the needs of insiders, whereby the people who live on that estate would have their own council, thus forming a social cement between the young people and others and, in particular, the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is some likelihood in these days that society may fall apart. There is much
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>316</span>
anarchy about. Hooliganism forms an example of this current disintegration. For that reason I am in favour of a local neighbourhood council. We see that there is a need for them. After all, tenants' associations and other bodies are formed in order to supply this very need. I believe also that the police should walk around on their own two feet like the old village bobby, and should not scurry about so fast and furiously in panda cars. I have been out with the local police in a panda car, and was made aware of the disintegration, amounting almost to social anarchy, which is developing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus I believe that the urban district needs a neighbourhood council, to fill the gap on the spot—in the streets, in the play centre, and around the housing estates—between the councillor, who was perhaps elected last March or last May, and the people. I plead for this organism, this form of government at neighbourhood level. I plead also that it should be independent. The councillor should not be a member, but, like a Member of Parliament, he should be able to visit it in order to get advice and information on what is happening in his ward or constituency. In other words, this kind of urban parish council would form a conscience both for a Member of Parliament and for the councillor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I should mention that I always read the speeches of my hon. Friend the Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter), who is famed for his percipience. In column 292 of Tuesday afternoon's proceedings of the OFFICIAL REPORT, he had some wise words to say concerning general amenities, such as play centres, and mentioned the need for local people on such a council to look at plans, particularly in connection with play space on housing estates. I have myself seen examples where play groups have been badly sited close to old-age pensioners in their eighties, living alone in flats. There are many other ways in which a council at this level can, with advice and information, assist the elected councillor, as well as the constituency Member of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) spoke of involvement. Again, there is a need for this cement to which I have referred. Many young people in their teens, including university students, feel that they are not in the picture. They are opting out. They
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>317</span>
have their own newspapers, whether underground or not. I am told, "We do not know what is happening with this Government or any other unless we read the underground newspapers to find out what is going on in academic or other affairs". I believe it to be a bad tendency that so many young people are opting out of what, in the past, have been considered to be the usual mechanics of administering their lives, of administering the city and, of course, administering the local neighbourhood with a ward councillor where these people live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want people opting out, either in my constituency or in any other constituency; I do not want them taking to the pavements and erecting their own mechanisms and their own ways of tackling difficulties in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members opposite often bleat about party politics on the council. This kind of urban parish council is a place where men can go to an independent person, who has no party label, because his sole object is to serve the people who live around him. So I plead on all these counts that there is an overwhelming need, at this low local level, for people who live in the locality to play a much larger part themselves in helping their Member of Parliament or their councillor to do his job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David James</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for being here so rarely, but I am serving on a Private Bill in another Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want very briefly to support my hon. Friends the Members for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) and for Dorset, South (Mr. Evelyn King) in relation to Amendment No. 224. If ever there was a county full of ancient boroughs as defined in that Amendment, it is Dorset. There are two ancient boroughs in my constituency, Blandford Forum and Shaftesbury. Bland-ford was given the right of a fair, which at the time was the status symbol equivalent to borough status, as long ago as the 13th century in the reign of Henry II. Their charter originated in 1605. Bland-ford is known as Blandford Forum. It is not a Roman town, and this name is believed to have been the snobbish aberration of a monk in the Middle Ages. None the less, the charter is 366 years old. My other centre of interest is Shaftesbury, which is an old Saxon town sited on top
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>318</span>
of a hill and its charter goes back to 1604. It would be my submission, like that of my hon. Friends, that to obliterate these ancient titles in the interests of modernity would serve no useful purpose whatsoever. Let us maintain the dignity of these places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, West (Mr. Wingfield Digby) is the only Dorset Member not on this Committee. He has written to me because he is equally worried about Dorchester, Brid-port, Lyme Regis and Sherborne. I have obviously not done as much homework on them as on my own constituency, but Dorchester, as its name suggests, was indeed a Roman encampment and there are good grounds for believing that the site was inhabited for at least 2,000 years prior to the Romans. It is understandable that any self-contained village community which has been on a site for 4,000 years will have a certain sense of local dignity and propriety. I am confident, from what my hon. Friend said, that this is a consideration that he will keep in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Evelyn King) gave me furiously to think on this question of parish versus borough, because, of course, "borough" is a Germanic word, rooted in pre-time almost. One has Edinburgh, Hamburg, Gothenburg; one has it even in Shaftesbury which I have mentioned. So "borough" is a very deeply rooted word, but I see that it could cause confusion with urban boroughs. On looking up "parish" in a book which I did not know existed—the 23-volume edition of the Oxford English Dictionary—I find that "parish" had its first statute usage in 1075 A.D. I think that is good enough for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson) accused us on this side of the Committee of often bleating about party politics in local government, and he thought that parish councils would preclude such party political debate. I should like to mention that in our area it was his party, unfortunately, that began to fight certain rural parish elections on party grounds. In those cases we even lost, which is even more unfortunate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is typical of the other side of the Committee. I made a perfectly genuine contribution to the debate. These councils would enable

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>319</span>
good, genuine men of good will in their local habitat to make a contribution when often they have not the time or the nervous energy to fight a dog-fight, as the hon. Gentleman is tending to begin in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman took that line, because I am now going to agree with what he said. When he accuses us of bleating, that is hardly non-partisan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was impressed by his reference to the need to be brief because of the time factor. I hope he is not now trying to rush us through, because I have had a letter from one constituent protesting about the way in which this Bill was being rushed through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Trew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend would inform his constituent that there are in this Bill 251 Clauses and 30 Schedules, and, bearing in mind that we are now on our seventh Sitting on Clause 1, if we continue at the present rate of progress it will take us roughly 25 years to pass this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that information. I shall certainly pass it on. It sounds as though the new pension arrangements will be very welcome to all of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apology for speaking at some length on this group of Amendments, because they raise two important principles affecting the future of local government. The first principle, on which there has largely been general agreement on both sides of the Committee, is that of maintaining the grass roots involvement of people at community level. The Amendments also provide some means whereby we can maintain and preserve the important traditions of community service and history in many of our ancient towns and boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With very few exceptions, every hon. Member on both sides of the Committee has spoken in support of both those principles, and I think it would be a tragedy if the Government lost this opportunity of creating some means whereby both these principles could be preserved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was immensely heartened by the helpful and important statement made by the Under-Secretary at the beginning of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>320</span>
the last Sitting. Nevertheless, I was a little concerned at his lack of enthusiasm. I felt that he was not seizing this opportunity with a crusading fervour, to create these new community councils. I am confident, however, that the Government will come back with far-reaching Amendments that will enable these opportunities to be seized.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that there is a special opportunity today, because of the great upsurge that has occurred in recent years in an interest in environmental matters, in conservation, preservation of ancient buildings, and control over planning. It is often the local amenity societies that are the genuine watchdogs of the local interests, rather than any far removed councils, and I believe that we can use this opportunity to combine this instinct for voluntary service in the communities together with the tradition of genuinely local government. There is an opportunity to create this genuine fusion of this spirit in local areas, and I hope the Government will see it as a real opportunity, and not as a grudging concession to the points made on behalf of certain interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that approach to this matter should be flexible. The Government have been trying to find criteria to meet the demand of different areas. Certain of my hon. Friends have tried to put in figures. One Amendment calls for a population of 10,000 beneath which borough status should be preserved. Another hon. Member suggested a 20,000 population. I think it is unfair on many boroughs if one tries to establish lines of that nature. The important point is total flexibility, and if a particular area, district, borough or town, neighbourhood or collection of wards in a conurbation want to create a community council, they should be allowed to do so. It should be a statutory body, but it should be a voluntary body in the sense that the community need only create one if there is a desire so to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to my own constituency, not because I want to see the pattern that I would like for my own area to be applied to the country as a whole, but because by doing so I think it demonstrates the need for variety in the pattern of local government that we establish. This Bill avoids the pitfalls of the Redcliffe-Maud Report and the unitary system that hon. Members opposite favour. I

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>321</span>
genuinely believe that that system would have been remote and nothing that hon. Gentlemen opposite have said has convinced me that it would not have done great harm to the principles of democracy in local involvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members might remember the campaign launched by rural district councils against the remoteness of Maud, when they put forward the slogan "Do not vote for R. E. MOTE". In my own constituency it would cause me embarrassment because it is virtually my own name, and in an election year I would not enjoy the prospect of such a slogan being used on stickers, car labels and posters. However, my own rural district council was co-operative and declined to participate in the campaign. Indeed, they have been co-operative with each other. What has been striking is the way in which different authorities, which will probably come together in a new district, have co-operated on a voluntary basis to try to iron out the many problems that will occur on amalgamation. This shows the genuine desire on the part of all authorities to make the new system of local government work. There is little determination to hold back. People are getting together in the way that they should to create the new system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my area we have two ancient boroughs, one a large rural district and one an urban district. It is interesting to note that the ancient borough of Queen-borough in Sheppey, which has a charter going back 700 years, three or four years ago expanded its boundaries to incorporate an urban district and a rural district. That was the amalgamation of three authorities into one, and it was done in such a way as to maintain the ancient traditions of the borough. The enlargement has worked out as an efficient and effective method of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is probable that the new district in my area will comprise the same authorities as those to which I have referred. My first instinct was to think it attractive if the new district could take over the ancient charter of one of the older boroughs and incorporate it into a new charter, at the same time applying for a mayor and taking over all the dignities of a borough. That idea would be popular locally. It would give a population of approximately 100,000 people and would cover a large area of land. However, in view of what
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>322</span>
I have heard and read in recent weeks, I confess I have had second thoughts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that particular area there is a lot to be said for the new district remaining as a district and not becoming a borough, and for the leader of that district not to become a mayor but a chairman. If that were so, the existing dignities and traditions of the town authorities could remain with effective community councils within the boroughs. There would be a chairman of the district council and mayors of parishes, town councils or community councils. In that way we would be preserving the traditions and titles within the towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people say that the title "chairman of the council" does not sound very impressive. I am not sure that that is a convincing argument. After all, we have chairmen of county councils who carry considerable weight and prestige. Whatever Amendments are brought forward, I should like to think that there will be sufficient flexibility to enable a new district, if it wishes to become a borough, to apply to do so. If after amalgamation it decides that it would like to retain its borough titles, status and mayoralties in the original towns and communities, linked nevertheless to elected councils of the parish council nature, it should be allowed to do so. We must avoid trying to lay down a rigid pattern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman's

term—to the unified mayoralty for the new district?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to rephrase it then. In no sense can they be subsidiary. What the Bill does not and should not have is the tier system of government. Nevertheless, we believe that parish councils as community councils have an active rôle to play as a contribution to local affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting point. I understand the suggestion put forward by the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Goronwy Roberts). We have a situation at present where rural boroughs have retained their borough status within a district, but with powers only of a parish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that this type of approach eliminates many of the problems. If one can provide for smaller towns and free-standing boroughs to have the option to select what type of nomenclature they use for the leader of their council, and can retain their own community council, it would do away with other complications which could arise if one legislates for what the leader should be called or how the charters should be amended and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Flexibility is most important in this context. There is a danger that there will be one chamber with the mayor of the new district and about four other mayors who are important dignitaries in their local area. This could be avoided if the chairman were not called a mayor. I do not know what one would call a collection of five mayors in one council chamber; there must be a suitable collective noun for such a number.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A mayors' nest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A string of mayors, perhaps, as an alternative. This danger need not be exaggerated. It is a matter of formality and will not happen often. I suspect that where there is an individual borough with the ability to retain its own mayor there will be less pressure on the new district to apply for a new charter and become a borough in its own right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This argument applies particularly to the large rural areas where there is an amalgamation of rural districts and a number of small boroughs. In those cases it might be better if they were to remain as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>324</span>
districts and not apply for a new charter. It is a matter for discretion and should be left to the areas to decide. I would be very sad if the Bill in any way destroyed the fine traditions of local community service which are expressed in the trappings of mayoralty. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) does not agree; he believes that mayors should be abolished. This misses the point, that after sometimes nearly 1,000 years of community service they find their expression in the fine old traditions in the mace, the mayoralty, the robes and so on. They generate a community pride which inspires more community service, and the result of that is that one has better local government. It helps to improve community life, and that is immensely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister stated one major objection, which is the question of the divisive effect if one allows these old towns to retain their corporate identity at a time when one is trying to create new districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote a passage from the 	<i>Local Government Chronicle</i> of 26th November, 1971. The passage states that to do it this way
	<br><blockquote><p>"would mean retaining the separate identity of many towns in a way which would be bound to detract from the unity of the new districts concerned".</p></blockquote>
I understand the point, but I think the hon. Gentleman is totally confusing the issue. Surely there is no question that we are trying to destroy or in any way reduce the identity of individual towns. We are trying to create new and efficient systems of local government. We are sometimes putting three or four different towns together into a new unit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I think it is unreasonable to expect—perhaps it is undesirable to try to obtain—a new sort of corporate identity for a large area of this nature or a new sort of community patriotism for towns which are 20 miles apart. These towns already have an identity. That identity will remain and, indeed, should remain. We should try to encourage it, and by this method we can do so. I do not think there is a divisive factor involved in this question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point raised by the Minister I did not think was very convincing. The Minister said there would be a limited number of people willing to serve in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0184">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>325</span>
local government, and that they will have to divide their attentions between the new district authority or the old town authority. This omits the real point. There is to be a large number of people, who have given many years of service to local government, who will now find themselves excluded from local government, because of the substantial reduction there will be in the number of councillors required. This certainly applies to my area, and I am sure it applies to others. Where, today, there are hundreds of councillors representing five or six authorities, in future there will be half that number. Many people who have given very valuable service to the community will now find no means of so doing. The Amendment offers some way of ensuring that this important service can be retained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the public really understands the degree of dedication given by local councillors, on a totally voluntary basis, to public affairs. Community councils could help considerably in capturing that vital instinct in the interests of the general public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a more persuasive argument against the points that the Minister raised. The Government have accepted the idea of community councils for Wales. Although the Minister put forward the point that there is some difference in electoral timing which complicates the issue, that really was the only reason he advanced. So for some reason in Wales they may have community councils, elected immediately, on the basis of the pre-existing borough or district boundaries. There is no objection there to the divisive effect of retaining these old authorities. There are no arguments about split loyalties. There is no argument even about boundaries, because they are accepting the preexisting boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why cannot we have the same thing for England as for Wales? I do not know why Wales should be favoured in this way. It appears to some of the English Members that the Scots and the Welsh always come off best. Perhaps it is because the Welsh talk more, and that they need many more councils to accommodate them. But this does not persuade me that we cannot do for England what we are proposing to do for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge that every consideration be given to giving these communities a real voice to live within this system of local government.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>326</span>
We should seize this great opportunity. The problem of boundaries is eliminated totally if we allow the existing authorities to apply for parish status, town status, community status or whatever they see fit on the lines of their existing boundaries. I cannot see any problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to conclude, briefly, on the question of the functions of these councils. It has been suggested that they will have very little to do, that they will be talking shops, pressures groups and so on. Pressure groups are immensely valuable. The more one moves the administrative centre away from the town, the more important these pressure groups become. In Faversham we have a new amenity society called the Faversham Society which has helped, in an enterprising borough, to transform the whole instinct of the community in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amenity societies show what can be done without any authority at all. The new town councils, given some limited rating power on the lines of rural parish at present, or given some grants under Clause 135 where appropriate provision, I believe, is made, and given a fusion with the instinct of local service, can make a valuable contribution. They could cover important ceremonial and civic functions. A considerable amount of charity work is done by local mayors and local council chairmen. That could be perpetuated by such an organisation. There is the area of conservation and the preservation of ancient buildings I repeat that one does need a local watchdog organisation, with a powerful voice, to ensure that our heritage in these areas is preserved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the problem of old people's homes and welfare services. It has been found that it is often the mayor's local charity that has inspired a great deal of work in this connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the problem of traffic. Hon. Gentlemen opposite have mentioned the problem of heavy vehicles driving through residential areas when traffic has been re-routed through those areas, disturbing people's lives in that way. It is the local society that very often pinpoints that type of disruption and brings pressure to bear to prevent it happening. I am not sure that a council, some distance removed, will ever be as receptive to the complaints of the individual residents as they will be to the new community councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to mention consultation on planning permission. I know many rural
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>327</span>
parishes have been complaining, and properly complaining for many years, that they have not been consulted about developments which have been permitted in their areas. Their complaints were valid. Very often, if they were given prior knowledge they could have prevented some of the worst excesses that have occurred in many of the rural areas. It is important that they should be consulted, and if they should be consulted, it is right that free-standing boroughs, with a population of 20,000 and a tradition of local government going back for centuries, should be consulted about proposed developments in their towns. These new community councils should have the statutory right of consultation on important planning decisions. This is just one of the features that I hope to see built into the structure and functions, when we come to consider them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will consider very positive proposals, not grudging concessions, to seize this opportunity. We must ensure that there is no hiatus after 1974 for these new authorities. We must also ensure that we are not laying down an obligatory or statutory form for every area. It should be voluntary. If it can be voluntary it will save many complications. If we can achieve this, we will be making a real contribution to the cause of genuine local democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to save time, I should like to start by making what would otherwise have been a point of order. I am not asking you for a reply, Sir Stephen, but perhaps you might consider it. We are considering a group of 33 Amendments and one new Clause. It might be for the convenience of the Committee, when you come to deal with your selection of Amendments, if you were to tell us on what page of the Amendment Paper the Amendments are situated. I have had some difficulty in finding Amendment No. 257.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had intended to intervene a good deal earlier in the debate, but this has been such an interesting and important a debate that I felt it right not to do so. Indeed, the last speech—that by the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate)—reassured me, if the other speeches had not already reassured me, that I was right. I had imagined that the reason for the hon. Gentleman's election to Parliament was that all the constituents of Faversham
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>328</span>
were in favour of the unitary system and. therefore, that the slogan "Do not vote for R, E. Moate" had failed completely. But there may have been other reasons for his selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with the speech of the Under-Secretary and, as is customary, bring in the points that have been made by hon. Members on both sides. It is a very interesting situation with the Minister saying that we are not proceeding fast enough and with the hon. Member for Faversham and others saying that they are receiving correspondence from people saying that the Bill is being proceeded with too quickly. I can probably reconcile these two points of view. The reason people think that this Committee is proceeding too quickly is that, in so many ways, it is an ill-thought out Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can understand that there may be differences on the question of boundaries. The Minister will, I hope, take into account the points of view expressed on boundaries and will look at them again. But surely the question of powers, functions and principles ought to have been decided before the Bill was submitted to Parliament. It is extraordinary that in these 33 Amendments and one new Clause under debate the Under-Secretary—in a splendid enough speech—made a Green Paper type of speech. He was not replying to Amendments but was saying that there are advantages and disadvantages. He was saying, "I sympathise with what is being said and want to look at it again".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are on Clause 1. If this had been Clause 53 or Clause 54, how much time would there have been to reconsider all these matters? I do not know why this should be so or why this was not thought out in the first place. Perhaps it is ungracious of me to complain about it, but it seems extraordinary that, the Under-Secretary having pointed out that this all needed to be reconsidered and that he would bear in mind what so many hon. Members were saying about it, when we return to it on Report the Minister—"Mr. Hyde", against the Under-Secretary's "Dr. Jekyll"—will be asking us to move along more quickly and come to an end of the discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One example why we are not moving quickly enough—and an example also of the muddle and the illogicality, as the hon. Member for Faversham pointed out—is the situation which obtains with regard to Wales. The hon. Member and various of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>329</span>
my hon. Friends have pointed out that under the Bill Wales is to have its community councils. It is to have them virtually straight away. This is splendid. The hon. Member for Faversham says that we are treating the region more kindly than we are treating England. I would make two corrections. First, Wales is not, and never has been, a region. It is a Principality. But there may be something Freudian about that mistake. Second, if the suggestion my right hon. and hon. Friends and I made earlier had been adopted, that Wales should be dealt with in a separate Bill, this extraordinary illogicality would not have been so obvious and the Minister might have got his will and this Bill might have been disposed of a good deal more quickly than it clearly will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These points of difference are bound to arise. They are bound to arise when we discuss England and when we discuss Wales. Hon. Gentlemen opposite as well as my hon. Friends will necessarily make the point. They will ask why Wales is being treated better in one respect and perhaps, worse in another. If it is all in the same Bill, why is it being treated differently? I do not know if it would still be in order for the Minister to talk to the Leader of the House with a view to removing the Welsh Clauses from the Bill and putting them in a separate Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or the appropriate Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, but I should have thought that the Leader of the House is probably the person to say if there is sufficient time for it to be discussed on the Floor of the House. I can assure him that there would be no opposition from this side. It might help the Minister to move proceedings along more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was very interested—again, was this another Freudian lapse?—that the Under-Secretary seemed quite unable to grasp that in this long series of Amendments, but with the addition of new Clause 1, we are discussing what are known as neighbourhood councils, community councils, urban parishes, or whatever name we want to give them. The hon. Gentleman said that he was interested in the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Dennis Howell). They were very good arguments
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>330</span>
and the hon. Gentleman admitted that they arose from personal knowledge but, he said, they had nothing to do with this series of Amendments. They were, of course, germane to them in everything that has been said on this side. My hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) made a very persuasive speech in which he indicated that this was so. I do not know whether the Under-Secretary was briefed on this, but perhaps when he comes to wind up he will address himself more strongly to this question than he did in his opening speech or intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the dispossessed boroughs, we have heard a great deal on the question of the name "boroughs", but we have not heard the name "commune" mentioned. Hon. Gentlemen opposite are so keen on going into the Common Market. They should know that everywhere one goes in Western Europe these days one sees "Commune of Europe" chalked up in the appropriate language. It is most surprising that they have not thought of that name, although it is an ugly name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, the argument for the dispossessed boroughs rests on the question of history and tradition. The hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) mentioned Ludlow and its tradition, which goes back to 1461. He was speaking for one of his anti-Common Market hon. Friends, who would probably point out to him that he was anxious to preserve the traditions, not only of Ludlow, but, in his attitude to the Common Market, those of England also, which goes back even before 1461.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Domesday Book goes back to 1066, which is an earlier date than any mentioned today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Historic traditions are very interesting and important, but I thought that the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) made a better point on this matter than most, namely that old people or ill people in hospital would find themselves a little bemused by the visit of the "chairman of the council" instead of the "mayor", which they all know and understand. It is just a word that one has grown up with. It is a very telling point and I have no doubt that the Under-Secretary will bear it in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But these are minor points. My hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>331</span>
Friend the Member for Birmingham, Norlhfield (Mr. Carter) may be a little too Jacobinical in wanting to do away with the whole lot, but there is something in what he says. When one considers tradition, whether it be 1461 or earlier, it is extraordinary how quickly traditions are created. There must be hon. Members here who know when the Speaker's Procession started in this House. We do not think about it—it is one of the traditions of the House. Actually, it dates from after the Second World War. It never took place before then; yet we accept it as a very firm tradition of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Traditions are created by generations as they come and I can imagine—and perhaps the hon. Member for Cannock who has a vision of these things can also imagine—the tremendous start with which the elders of Ludlow must have received their Charter in 1461. I am willing to bet him that there were citizens around that area, and certainly in the neighbouring areas, who asked what Ludlow had done to deserve a Charter, who said that modernity was a shocking thing, and who asked why not stick to the old Saxon traditions? This is something that time fortunately changes and heals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had some experience of this. When I became the Member for Deptford, it was a borough on its own and it had its mayor and its great traditions—traditions which went back to Henry VIII, to Peter the Great, to shipbuilding and all the traditions of the British Navy in its early days. We had Sir Francis Drake's "Golden Hind" moored in Deptford for 50 years after it had circumnavigated the globe. So we were experts on tradition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had our own mayor. Then, suddenly, we became part of Lewisham. The borough of Lewisham had a mayor. We became a part of that borough; and, as time has gone by, a new tradition, centering on the mayor of Lewisham, has grown up. Time has a remarkable habit of healing and of creating new traditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extraordinary for anyone to argue for the preservation of traditions in his own parish or borough and yet to forget the traditions of a whole nation when discussing the Common Market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The weakest argument in the Under-Secretary's even-handed Green Paper approach to parish councils for the dispossessed boroughs was that councillors would perhaps be inclined to serve on the parish councils rather than on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>332</span>
larger authorities. There are likely to be many dispossessed councillors. There should not be much difficulty in finding people who could serve on both such authorities. If the new parish councils, communes, boroughs, or whatever they are to be called, are set up, they should have sufficient powers and functions to make serving on them worthwhile. One might perhaps serve on the lower-tier and on the higher-tier body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an earlier debate the hon. Member for Cannock talked of toothless councils. Put in teeth, and I have no objection to the trappings, or even to a few gold fillings. The point is that the teeth should be able to bite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that on reflection the Under-Secretary will not find it a disadvantage that many mature and public-spirited citizens would be more inclined to serve on the parish councils. To me it seems a positive advantage, but I do not think it will work out that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to a matter which the Under-Secretary did not discuss, the question proposed by new Clause 1 on neighbourhood councils and community councils in towns, which is of concern to hon. Members on this side and which seems to have received a considerable degree of sympathy from hon. Gentlemen opposite. We should look first at the purpose of the neighbourhood councils—call them what one will. There is one in my constituency. If one is playing the numbers game on populations, parish councils, and so on, my neighbourhood council covers a population of 30,000, which is higher than the figures quoted earlier in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the Telegraph Hill Neighbourhood Council of Deptford, I will give a brief 	<i>resumé</i> of its reasons for wanting such a council and the reasons for its success. The Council says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The housing is old, and overcrowded. Three times as many people have to share their homes as in the rest of Lewisham, and there are three times as many immigrants, making the housing shortage even more acute.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Something had to be done, for although these people have the services of the Welfare State to meet their individual needs, something was needed to convert isolated individuals or families, struggling with their own problems, into an integrated, stable and caring community".</p></blockquote>
That is a good purpose, embracing both local government and local democracy. We can all agree, even the Under-Secretary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0188">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>333</span>
and the Secretary of State, that that is a highly worthy objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we tried to get a bus service for the area, which is one of the steepest hills in London, we managed to do it, and the Secretary of State was of some assistance. Obviously the right hon. Gentleman thought that there was something in this, and no doubt he is well aware of the activities of the Telegraph Hill Neighbourhood Council and of the others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point at issue is whether such a neighbourhood council should be a voluntary association or a statutory body. I come down strongly on the side of the statutory authority. My hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth put the point very clearly; my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop), an expert on the subject, equally so. I can make one or two fresh points, and I shall do so briefly, recapitulating the arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it would be wrong to have such councils subject to the whim of superior councils, as the Telegraph Hill Neighbourhood Council is at the moment, because it cannot help itself. The superior council of Lewisham, in the case of Telegraph Hill, has been friendly and co-operative, but the people of the area do not have the feeling that they are independent and capable of governing themselves. On occasions conflict might arise, and it would not be of advantage to what we are trying to set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, in my experience voluntary associations tend to get a particular bee in their bonnet. In the case of Telegraph Hill, one could have made the criticism that they the Council was spending overmuch time on the bus action committee, to get the bus travelling along Telegraph Hill, perhaps to the exclusion of other things. A neighbourhood council should be wide-ranging in the problems it tackles and should represent all the problems and all the people in its area. Voluntary associations tend to go for one thing at a time, and not to be as far-ranging as they should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nevertheless, does my right hon. Friend agree that one does not rule out the other. They are complementary rather than contradictory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that is true. I am arguing the case for a statutory authority. However, my hon. Friend is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>334</span>
The other disadvantage of the voluntary association is financial. From where does the money come? If it is by grant from the local authority, the association is in the pocket of the local authority. Telegraph Hill asks for donations and contributions of 50p or £1. Those sums are not great, but they are a factor, and that is wrong when one is considering the self-governing community. This is another argument in favour of a statutory authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another and stronger argument is that an efficient neighbourhood council, which is able, not only to challenge planning decisions, but also, because of its local knowledge, to suggest what the local planning situation should be, must have technical assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Faversham mentioned this point, and I absolutely agree with him. One cannot have a group of volunteers in the most complicated form of administration in the country—planning. The Minister is doing his best to simplify this, and I give him credit for that; he understands that it can become very remote from ordinary individuals. However, because it is so remote and so complex, it must be understood by ordinary people if they are to help make the decisions towards good planning which they can do because of their knowledge of their area. Therefore, they must have technical assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How they will obtain that assistance if they are on a voluntary basis I do not know. The finance, the organisation and the people who can give the necessary technical advice—for which all of us who have been concerned with local authorities have been so deeply indebted to our own local government officials—are lacking. This is a further vital reason for making these authorities statutory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Planning deeply affects the lives, futures and hopes of every citizen. If we believe in participation—in taking part, which is what "participation" means—it is not a question of hoping that people will be articulate or finding people who will be articulate on their behalf: it is helping them to understand the problem. This is not because they are normally ignorant in the way that they conduct their lives. It is because of the complexity of the problem. Planning decisions often come upon people locally before they can understand them, and by the time they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>335</span>
have realised the effect on their lives the decision has already been taken and it is too late. If we are to act in the spirit of Skeffington and of Howell, we should consider and approve the establishment of community councils on a statutory basis with the finance and organisation necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One final point, and then perhaps the Under-Secretary can give us a little clearer lead than, with respect, he gave in his intervention earlier. How should such a community council arise? What should be the process of creating community councillors? My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) made a very interesting suggestion as to how they might be selected. Something similar was tried in Athens, I believe, and worked very well on the whole. Curiously enough, the division lists are still extant—one of 1,800 people and the other of 1,300 people. From the Athenian electoral list of the over 18-year olds, some electors were chosen to be members of the council. If they attended, they were paid. If they did not attend, they were punished. It is amazing how well attended the council meetings were.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the whips can do!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are making a very bad job of it on the Government side today, perhaps on our side too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a method of selecting councillors is not much use in a large modern, industrial community. It is much simpler to select them by election, by the democratic system. That cannot be denied, interesting as my hon. Friend's idea was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last, and perhaps the strongest, reason why community councils should be statutorily based is to ensure that their members are democratically elected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nobody can have the slightest doubt that we have had a most interesting and wide-ranging debate on this important aspect of local government and how we can encourage people to take a greater interest in it. I listened to many of my hon. Friends painting a great pageant of historical continuity and arguing that many of these historical associations should be continued. I wish that they had shown the same consideration for their hon. Friend—namely myself—when, a few weeks ago they voted his
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>336</span>
parliamentary constituency out of existence after 676 years. However, I would not want any of them to think that that motivates me in trying to vote their boroughs out of existence in this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) was less than fair in his opening remarks about the flexibility which we have tried to show in the debate. I should have thought that all members of the Committee would welcome a greater degree of flexibility from Governments in bringing legislation before the House. If a Government have put forward, as we have done quite clearly in the Bill, a firm way of progressing on this aspect of parishes and communities, but then decide as a result of what has been said since publication of the Bill that it would be worth looking at it again, it is totally to the credit of the Government that they should say so at the beginning of the debate and allow all hon. Members to contribute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be unfair to the hon. Gentleman, but my point was one of timing. This is a point of such importance and principle that, in preparing a Bill of 250 Clauses, it should have been considered decisively before the Bill was published. I agree that it is flexible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is perfectly right the matter was considered and a firm conclusion was reached, but we are not prepared to stand here and say that we can make every possible decision correctly on every occasion. We are now saying to the Committee that we welcome its advice, and that we will look at certain matters again, and I believe that this is exactly what Governments should do in cases like this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was slightly surprised to hear the right hon. Gentleman go on to tell us not to be flexible about parishes but to be totally flexible in our views on Wales and asking us to reconsider that question. That was a somewhat inconsistent approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the right hon. Gentleman's second point, on which he asked for clarification, I have looked up the HANSARD report of our second sitting on 7th December and perhaps my words could have been more carefully chosen, but I think that they indicate the point I intended to make before I gave way to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>337</span>
the hon. Member opposite, in that it is perfectly true that the proposals embodied in new Clause 1 do not bring community councils into existence in urban areas. However, they give discretionary power to the Secretary of State to introduce them at a subsequent date. This is important, because it is by no means certain that the Secretary of State would cover the country with community councils in the way in which the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) implied. I agreed with the hon. Member who intervened by saying immediately that he had made a perfectly fair point, and I will leave the matter there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first of the three main areas of debate that we have covered, there are three real issues: first, the community councils within the urban areas—a new concept in terms of local government on a statutory basis; second, the free-standing boroughs which are to be dispossessed, although they would become parishes after a review as the Bill is now drawn; and, third, the problem of the rural boroughs, which has been mentioned by various hon. Members on this side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To begin with community councils, which were dealt with in summary by the right hon. Member for Deptford, I said when I intervened at the beginning of the debate that there is not the slightest doubt that, in the light of what has been said, the Government want to look at the options open to us, to see if there is any way of making Amendments at a later stage on the three issues raised by the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I listened to the right hon. Member's summary, I could not help but be aware, particularly in the case of community councils, of the difficulties posed by each of the solutions put forward by the right hon. Gentleman, not only in principle but in timing. The first point in the right hon. Gentleman's argument was that he came out firmly in favour of community councils being statutory organisations against the advice of his hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop), who wanted growth from voluntary organisations, to give the community councils a sense of independence from district councils, as they would be. This raises an important question whether, if one puts the emphasis now on the creation of new community councils, one is not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>338</span>
prejudicing in a substantial way the opportunity to get the new district councils off to the start that we believe to be necessary. On the timing issue, therefore, this would become an important consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the right hon. Gentleman indicated the success that had come to the Telegraph Hill neighbourhood council, and made the point that that had started as a voluntary organisation and, in fact, centred around the particular issue to do with bus routes in that area. The right hon. Gentleman suggested how much better it would be if this became a statutory council and was able to deploy itself on a wide range of activities. This misses the point in many ways, because the sort of organisations that we are talking about—and the only ones of which we have experience at the moment—are essentially concentrated upon some specific local issue. They have had their success because it was a deeply felt local issue. If one then asked for it to be perpetuated when the local issue had died down, one might feel that it did not continue with the momentum that had been given to it originally because of the preoccupation with one particular issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is one of the great strengths of these neighbourhood councils of the sort we are now talking about, that they have a main preoccupation, and they see it themselves as having a particular purpose to deal with a particular subject or narrow range of subjects. But the moment this is widened, one will bring in a large number of extra people who may not have the same purpose and dedication as the small group who involve themselves in the very vital local problem of that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the framework of a statutory body could help to encourage this kind of 	<i>ad hoc</i> movement to develop and support the statutory body by helping with advice and secretarial services, premises and so on, as well as providing a useful focal point for all kinds of separate protest movements to which the Under-Secretary has lightly referred?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think there are opportunities for a whole range of options. One is the total statutory framework of independence, as advocated by the right hon. Member. Then there are the halfway-house solutions of financial, clerical or accommodation assistance from the exist-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>339</span>
ing local authority, which could give some of the advantages sought by those who seek independence without the formality of a statutory independence, which can bring within itself its own bureaucratic framework and answerability which could prejudice much of the local enthusiasm that had made these organisations grow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point made by the right hon. Member was the argument that there would be a need for financial independence, which arose from the statutory situation. But this leads to the possibility of the recruitment of staff, and it is one of the problems which all of us face in local government today, with the complexity of decision making, that there is a great shortage of the skilled staff necessary to process the machinery of government. The larger number of tiers one creates, and the more groups of staff brought into official existence, the slower decision making is likely to be. Whilst this is undoubtedly of benefit to those people who are against a particular decision, to the vast majority of people who might be affected by but are not against the decision, the creation of a third tier of government with staff and independence might have a clogging effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I remember correctly, the right hon. Gentleman was at one time Minister of Public Building and Works and would have seen, as we in the Ministry of Housing and Construction have seen, the way in which statutory plans have been held up because of very small points which have been the subject of endless consultation, holding up the implementation of plans for a very wide area. The more one encourages a situation like this, the more harm is done to people who have a great deal to gain from the implementation of plans of the sort increasingly being brought in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on now to some of the other points. The hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) dealt with the question of community councils, and one point that the hon. Member raised was that to have the statutory basis of community councils introduced at the time of the English reorganisation in January, 1974, would introduce the possibility of a third tier of local government at a time when the pressures on existing staff of local authorities will be considerable. We come to the pressures in the next group of Amend-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>340</span>
ments, so I will not anticipate the debate. But one must not lose sight of the burden that will be placed on all those implementing any reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Shields emphasised the point that if one wants to see community councils get under way, it is probably better to encourage the growth of voluntary organisations and see them develop this way, rather than impose a statutory framework on a national basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that I wanted the statutory framework, although I was quite willing to see the process develop over a period of the establishment of actual councils within that framework.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying that point, because I noticed how much emphasis he put on the growth of voluntary organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was slightly worried, however, by the point made by the hon. Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter), when he said that he thought the turn-out electorally for the community councils could be a great deal higher than it would be for the new district councils. I think this indicates one of the real anxieties that those of us responsible for local government have, that if this were to be the case, one would be distracting away from the authorities with all the powers—because I do not think anyone doubts this—to authorities which would have relatively small powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman should make much of that point. The poll in the Golbourne ward neighbourhood council, which has no powers, as we all accept, was, in fact, 10 per cent. higher than the poll for the local authority itself. So this does not necessarily relate to powers at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a reasonable point to make, but I think that that particular neighbourhood council has a very exceptional set of circumstances surrounding it, and I think it would be difficult to generalise in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Farnworth said that in his judgment the powers under Clause 58—which are the powers for review of the districts, in order to see what new parishes should be set up—would never be used. I can reassure him on this, because the Bill as drafted
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>341</span>
contains reserve powers for the Boundary Commission to carry out the review if the districts do not carry it out satisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for North-ants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones)—who is not with us at this moment—raised the very urgent situation that faces those authorities that are dispossessed, following the introduction of this legislation on 1st April, 1974. He was followed by a considerable number of my hon. Friends, in particular the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Awdry), who stressed the difficulties that would face the communities that exist today as boroughs if there is no focal point for their representation when the vesting day takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend spoke in particular to Amendment No. 88, which sets a limit of 20,000 below which the dispossessed boroughs would automatically have parish status following the vesting day. As I said in my opening speech, we have that point very much in mind, and it is very much our intention to find a solution to this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty has been that while everyone agrees that something must be done, very few people are able so to define what should be done that a cast iron solution can be produced. The Amendment suggests that there should be free-standing towns, with a population limit of 20,000. That, certainly, is the sort of criterion which we shall examine. However, I think everyone would agree that having imposed a 20,000 limit, there will nonetheless be towns of 21,000 with an overwhelming case for being added to this category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope therefore that hon. Members opposite will accept my assurance that we are certainly aware of this problem, to which we intend to try to find a solution. If we succeed in that, we shall take the opportunity to introduce appropriate Amendments on Report. My hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) specifically asked whether Amendments would be introduced on Report. The answer, categorically, is "Yes", subject only to the proviso of our being able to solve the problem. However, the determination to do so is very strong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham referred to three small boroughs in his constituency, and expressed the view that it would not be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>342</span>
satisfactory for boroughs of that nature to find themselves called parishes and continuing in a lesser rôle. He thought that a new title was called for, whether or not a familiar title, in order to preserve the dignity of communities of that sort, and I understand that point of view. I think my hon. Friend will be aware that parishes do not have elected councils as do the boroughs. He strongly urged the view that there should be elected councils in the dispossessed boroughs, in whatever form it is decided they should continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham also wished to make clear his disagreement with the argument that certain people might be reluctant to serve on the new authorities, because they would be attracted to the parishes that would take the place of the boroughs, if a solution were found along those lines. Certainly, I do not wish to make a great deal of that point. One of the difficulties in the field of local government—we shall revert to it time and time again—is that there are a large number of arguments which nearly balance. This particular argument, while slightly militating against the immediate continuation of these authorities, is certainly not overwhelming. I believe there will be some people who make a marginal judgment to serve on the parish, if parishes were immediately available, who might otherwise have served on the district council. My hon. Friend pointed out that people might do both, which may well be so. However, there will be those who decide upon one or the other, and that is the sort of loss which, marginally, we wished to avoid taking on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether I heard my hon. Friend aright on the subject of parish elections. In fact there are elections to some parish councils. I was a little concerned that my hon. Friend, during the sixth Sitting of our proceedings, referred, in column 262 of the OFFICIAL REPORT, to a "parish meeting". Some parishes do have a parish meeting at which members are elected, but parish elections to parish councils do in fact take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I fully accept that that is the position. However, it is different from the situation in the boroughs, where elections take place of a kind with which we are more familiar. I was making the point that this was a different sort of election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>343</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I think my hon. Friend would find that the elections are identical in form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two systems of election. Some parishes use the ballot box. Others hold a parish meeting. It would be necessary to clear up the issue as to the form of election which will take place for the new parishes that might take the place of dispossessed boroughs, in order to meet the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Awdry).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Morrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must emphasise to my hon. Friend that the point of membership, and whether people who might continue to serve as members of the new parish councils in boroughs, if they are to exist, might not stand for district or county councils, is quite unimportant. At the present time, in many rural and district or county councils, a very high proportion of members of those councils are also members of other local authorities. Thus the point is not important, and if it has been stressed to my hon. Friend to the contrary I believe that he has been wrongly advised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the point is becoming more marginal as the Committee stage of the Bill wears on?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise, from what my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) has said to me privately, and has now reiterated publicly with even greater force, that the point is one which perhaps stands up less to the light of day than during the dark hours in which I first read the brief. We shall certainly bear his arguments in mind when examining the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with Amendment No. 224, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack), I turn to the realm of the rural boroughs. The purpose of the Amendment is to enable all boroughs within a district that are not providing the seat of local government and with a pre-1700 charter to have the power to call themselves an ancient borough, and to make the chairman of their parish council a mayor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will be the first to realise that, in drawing the distinction between pre-1700 and post-1700 the problem arises—as one of my hon. Friends immediately pointed out—that someone whose charter was granted in 1701 cannot understand why it should be inferior to one
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>344</span>
granted in 1699. However, I hope that my hon. Friend may be reassured by the undertaking which I gave in my introductory speech that we are very conscious of the historical associations of these boroughs. We appreciate people's feelings that these associations should continue, and we are immensely conscious that those who give their time to the performance of civic duties are adding something to the sense of community and social life of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our argument—again, by no means conclusive—that it is most important, when attempting to find a sensible and rational form of local government, not to preserve some historical facets of the old system which appear, in the context of the new system, to be a sham. This is one of the difficulties which arise with respect to mayors of rural boroughs. They hold a distinguished, historical office, but they hold no power. As the Bill is now drawn, they may well hold that office in an area where there would be a mayor with real power. To use the same title in respect of two people, one with a great deal of power and responsibility, the other with neither except at parish level, would be to cause confusion in the minds of the people—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I deprecate that argument, and however hard my hon. Friend argues I will not accept it at any stage of the Bill. The rather moving passage that I read from a letter sent to me by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. More) deals with this point very adequately. The mayor of Ludlow does not have great power at the moment. However, the sense of civic dignity, which is manifest when he does exercise his civic responsibilities, is very real.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon Friend is aware, the Mayor of Ludlow is not in a district where there is a mayor, but where there is a chairman of the district council. He is certainly subordinate in importance, but that is not the point. There may be two mayors in a district, one the mayor of a district which has converted itself into a borough and has within it a mayor of what, for the purposes of this debate, I shall call a continued rural borough. So there are two mayors, one of whom is important and doing a big job in local government and the other of whom simply has the trappings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>345</span>
That is not to say that we cannot find a solution to this problem. It is a real problem, and one cannot run away from that. In no way do we want to give the impression that we are not seeking a solution to the problem of the rural boroughs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. King</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend able to say a word about the suggestion I made to solve the difficulty he has in mind—that is, to distinguish between "the mayor"—'the mayor holding the seat of government at the centre—and one or more parish mayors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting idea. Perhaps a title could be devised which would deal with this, but it would be wrong for me at this moment, although I would welcome representations on it, to conjure up the sorts of title we might have. That could certainly be a solution to the problem, and we shall consider it very carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry to labour this point, but will my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That brings us back to the problem of comparability throughout the country. We should run into very real difficulties if we were to do this, because the chairman of the new district who was head of the community which is to become a borough would find it very difficult to explain why he was to be known by whatever title we invented whilst those on all the boroughs around him were something different. There is a spill-over effect whichever way we go. Nevertheless, I am being as helpful as I know how, without actually saying what the solution will be, to show that we are groping towards a solution.

My hon. Friend the Member for Devizes pointed out the desirability of mayors doing what might be called a lot of the social work associated with local government such as visiting hospitals, post offices and old people's homes. There must be many hon. Members on this Committee who have chairmen of rural district councils doing this social work at the moment and do not have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>346</span>
mayors to do it. I am not aware of any feeling that the old people have in some way been let down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath does not have a rural district council in his constituency, and, if he had, he might not be sitting here. I assure him that, in my experience, from having three rural districts in my constituency, I do not believe that the old people feel let down when the chairman goes round on these occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Goronwy Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is rather a question of whether they are used to mayors. The feeling of the Committee is that if there is a sudden change people may feel disappointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a substantial point. In six years as the Minister for Sport, I ate more meals with more chairmen of rural district councils than have ever been eaten by any Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that that is what one might call self-evident. I was interested in the point put forward by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) in dealing with some of the purposes of community councils. He suggested that there should be a long-stop organisation to deal with many of the very personal and real difficulties that arise. He mentioned housing and local planning decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is of great importance to my Department, and we have gone to great lengths to encourage local authorities to set up housing advisory centres in shopping precincts in order to provide, in a very familiar and available situation for the local citizens, all the advice and options open on mortgage schemes and house purchase, rent rebates, and so on. I opened one of these centres yesterday in Stockport and I was staggered to find—I do not want to make a great party issue out of it, but I put it very seriously to the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin)—that members of the local Labour Party refused to attend the opening ceremony and had made noises in the local papers about their intention of closing down the housing advisory centre if they win the forth-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>347</span>
coming borough elections. I was staggered to find that this attempt by central Government to encourage a local authority to provide information for people who desperately need it should have become a political shuttlecock in Stockport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Cakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could it not be that the members of the Labour group at Stockport found it very difficult to set up an advisory centre to deal with such matters as rents when they have no more powers with regard to rents, as the central Government dictate to them that they must increase the rents regardless of local need and regardless of local advisory centres?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The local authority in Stockport is setting up a most valuable service. I do not believe that anybody seriously looking at the centre I opened yesterday could believe that it was being used as an instrument of party politics. The civil servants and local authority officials who are working—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think I ought to intervene before we get too far into a discussion on what does or does not go on in Stockport. It might have been relevant as a passing allusion to the work of community councils, but we must not pursue the matter further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The example the Under-Secretary has raised is at the very heart of the points we have been discussing with regard to community councils. The housing advisory centre to which he refers would be seen by people simply as an extension of bureaucracy. What we want to see is an element of democratic control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As so many of the powers will remain with the district authorities, it is necessary for them to have the opportunity to explain what powers and options are available to people. There is no possible doubt that this service is being admirably provided in the centre at Stockport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point made by the hon. Member for Northfield was about local planning decisions. It will surprise nobody that my hon. Friend has spent a great deal of time in local government in working on a new set of advice to local authorities about the publicity surrounding
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>348</span>
planning decisions, and this will shortly see the light of day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None of this is participation. All of it is advice. Bureaucratic advice, or advice from the gentlemen in Whitehall, may be very interesting and very suitable, but it has nothing to do with democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with that, because, if information is provided for people, they have the opportunity to play a bigger part in what is going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the points which have been made about who should be informed about decisions and how local planning decisions should be advertised, it is, very much a question of encouraging participation and encouraging democratic processes. Those who are thus encouraged are then able to respond throughout the existing local authorities which have the powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the right hon. Member for Deptford that my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) made an extremely good speech. He raised what I believe to be one of the other anxieties which it would be wrong for the Committee not to take on board as one of the problems that could develop from the community councils' statutory framework as opposed to the voluntary framework. That is the part that party politics could play within statutory community councils. It would, of course, be possible to suggest that party politics would never enter into it—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]—I am not in the least ashamed to be a politician, but let me put to the Committee a very real difficulty that could follow. Everybody knows that there are considerable numbers of people operating in the voluntary services who do not want to be involved in what they regard as the party political world. [Hon. Members: "Oh".] If hon. Members do not accept this argument, I leave them to make their own judgments. I have not the slightest doubt, from my own experience, that there are people who feel reluctant to be involved in party political discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be for all sorts of reasons. One person who comes to mind is a doctor's wife. She is one of the most remarkable people involved in the local community. It is her firm view that it is not right to be involved in party political dialogue be-

cause of the effect on her husband's practice. It is up to individual hon. Members to decide whether she is right or wrong, but that is her view. There are others—schoolteachers' wives, for example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Oh."—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have these sedentary interruptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important point. There are a very large number of people who do not want to be involved in the party political battle. It is naive to believe that community councils set up all over the country on a statutory basis will not be involved in the party political battle—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have asked that we should not have sedentary interruptions and the Minister would do me a favour if he would ignore them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is advice I can willingly take, Sir Stephen. I do not withdraw one word of what I have said. It is important that we should preserve the opportunity for people to be involved in local voluntary effort without the feeling that they will be swamped by the political machines. I could not be anything other than a professional politician. I defend the activities of politicians and what the political parties achieve. However, there are large numbers of people who do not see that as their way forward. The problem could easily develop within statutory community councils that they would be subject to the political control of one party or another. This could produce something which is not in the minds of people who now see them as doing a valuable job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not provoke them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman try to convey to the Committee why he finds it difficult in the context of a statutory authority to accept one simple fact? Anyone may stand for an authority, whether he is an independent or a member of a political party. Why is the hon. Gentleman against the statutory element purely on the ground that party politics are dirty words at this level? The hon. Gentleman must accept that a person may stand whether he is in a party or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>350</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course anybody can stand. However, where the felling exists in statutory community councils that the decisions will not be taken by the local people coming together and having a free-for-all discussion, but will be taken by party decisions in party headquarters for party reasons, there will be a real change in attitude to certain people operating in this area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears that the whole of the hon. Gentleman's argument on this point is against the appointment of school managers, who are, as we know, appointed by the political parties. I have never found the slightest difficulty in seeing that they perform their job well and efficiently. Of course there are differences. There are differences between individuals. If the hon. Gentleman is adopting the point of view that, because people are Conservative, on the one hand, or Labour, on the other hand, they cannot properly come to a decent conclusion on what is good for the locality, it is most extraordinary. Whether or not one gives them our party political labels, there will be parties growing up. There will be one that will want such-and-such a development and one that will want another sort. This is what political parties are all about. As the Under-Secretary chooses to raise this sort of issue, it is no wonder we are not making sufficient progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that I find the hon. Gentleman's interruption unhelpful. It would have been wrong for this important point not to have been made. I want to put on record one thought which has clearly come across from hon. Gentlemen opposite. They not only accept but welcome the idea that if community councils were to come into existence in big cities they would be fought politically by the Labour Party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Under-Secretary of State leaves that point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot give way any more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Faversham then dealt with one other point. He asked for total flexibility for local communities to apply for the powers which he envisaged. What has emerged from the debate this morning, and on an earlier occasion, is the difficulty of lay-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>351</span>
ing down the criteria. It would be difficult because of the divisive situation which could emerge where a large part of a community becomes an authority. It is bound to have a divisive effect. It would be resented by the smaller part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One thing that one should not do is set criteria in such an area as my hon. Friend has described. It is probable that the predominant authority in the new district would not bother to apply to become a new council of its own because it would, in effect, be a duplication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can think of circumstances in which it would apply to become a council on its own, with regrettable effects. That is one of the anxieties we ought to take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a most helpful debate. All the issues which ought to have been raised have been raised. I repeat the assurance I gave to the Committee earlier in the debate. We will consider the views of hon. Members very carefully, with the object of seeing whether solutions can be found along the lines I have indicated and with a view to introducing Amendments on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an extraordinarily disappointing reply from the Under-Secretary—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Sedentary interruptions will not be allowed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not hope to take long in saying why I thought the Under-Secretary's reply was disappointing. However, if I do not carry the Committee with me I shall have to resort to further argument to sustain my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deal first with the democratic issue. The hon. Gentleman's argument is not one that could be advanced by any Minister who has ever served on a local authority. There are far too many people trying to undermine the political system, and especially the party political system, and more especially the voluntary role which thousands of people render to their local authorities in the democratic process by participating in the party political system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any Minister serving in a Department responsible for local government should understand the nature of the operation of raising money for sustaining the democratic system and presenting a choice for the people at election time so that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>352</span>
wishes of the people can be meaningfully determined. That is what party politics means in a local context. There are far too many people trying to undermine the voluntary role which thousands of people put into this process without having this done by a Minister of the Crown who says that we should be conducting our affairs in some other way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman. He will recall that I asked the Minister not to pursue the argument for too long. I have given the hon. Gentleman an opportunity to reply and I hope he will not pursue it too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My memory must be bad, Sir Stephen, but I accept your ruling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we talk about neighbourhood councils and voluntary councils, what really happens, particularly in country areas, is that they are captured by the ladies of the local community associations. The hon. Gentleman is telling us that he would like these bodies conducted by Conservatives as long as no one is aware of the fact. It is only when someone, who is honest, says that he is speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, Liberal Party or some other party that the local Conservatives become worried that their antics have been rumbled—[Hon. Members: "Cheek"]—It is not cheek.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My personal guess—there is no way of accurately assessing it—is that it is the minority parties, which are not swamped by the big paries, which gain because of the freedom from political manoeuvre. They can find a way into local authority work and voluntary organisations, not because they want to run a party machine. If there were a party machine they would be driven into one of the big parties. In my own experience, what the hon. Gentleman is saying is totally and ignor-antly informed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that was intended to be a defence of the operation of local Labour Parties and Liberal Parties the logic of it is not apparent to hon. Gentlemen on these benches. There are far too many people trying to derogate from the activities of party politicians. I cannot think of any other category of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>353</span>
people who make a bigger contribution to civic and national life than those who voluntarily put their efforts into party political activities. If the hon. Gentleman changes his mind when he reads the report of what he has said, I hope he will take the opportunity to correct the impression that he has given to hon. Gentlemen on this side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I again emphasise what my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) said concerning neighbourhood councils, although I accept the arguments put from right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite relating to rural parishes. As far as neighbourhood rural councils are concerned, I welcome the Under-Secretary's undertaking to look at the point again. I hope that he and his colleagues will consider what we have been saying. I emphasise that this is a moment of time when the democratic process needs to bring about the involvement of as many people as possible at</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The factor that has distinguished this legislation from the beginning is the indecent haste with which all this has been put to the House and to local authorities. This is a major restructuring and reorganisation of local government. It is something that we intend to last for a long time. Both sides of the Committee intend it to be progressive; and what we are getting is a hotchpotch of a Bill, with so many factors, ill-digested and unconsidered by the Government, being put both to local authorities and to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take some of the examples so far as the Bill affects the House. Today we had an astonishing statement from the Under-Secretary on a major issue before this Committee, the question of community councils in England, where one would expect the Government to have some opinions on the matter. The Under-Secretary said "We will try to find a solution. If we find one, we will put it down on Report". Later on he said, "I do not have a solution for the Committee, but we are groping towards one".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Government are being flexible, but surely, in a Bill of this magnitude and where this is a major Amendment, one would expect the Government to have formulated some sort of opinion. They have not done so as yet, and my Amendment would give them a chance to make their mind up on various matters which they have not had time to do, due to the possible petulance of the Secretary of State in insisting that this Bill shall go on to the Statute Book so quickly, and that the new local authorities shall come into operation in 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been other instances already, and we are only on Clause 1, which demonstrates the indecent haste that the Government are using in this Bill. At our last Sitting we discussed water and sewerage. That discussion was still not answered in this Committee by the Minister of State, Welsh Office. He did not touch upon it. Here we have a major Bill, with the Secretary of State making the statement last week in terms which are directly contradictory to the terms of the Bill being considered by this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is a dangerous precedent for the Government to set up a local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>356</span>
government Boundary Commission before this House has authorised the setting up of that Commission. This Commission is already negotiating with local authorities. It is taking evidence. It is preparing a report for the Minister which he is supposed to have in his hands by March of next year, and, by the progress we are making, that report might well be ahead of this Committee's report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong to approach legislation in this way. It is a dangerous precedent for any Minister to do this in advance of a decision by the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend knows more about these matters than I do. I agree that it is possibly an 	<i>ultra vires</i> act, and I have a number of Questions relating to this matter on the Order Paper, for the Secretary of State to answer in the House. Here again, one sees undue haste, undue rushing through of legislation and the use of unconstitutional means in order to do so. This Amendment, if it were accepted by the Government, would give them a breathing space to do the job properly and constitutionally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have in the Bill further instances that we have not reached yet, or discussed in any detail. The whole of Part X is directly contradictory to the policy expressed by the Lord Chancellor with regard to the reorganisation of magistrates' courts. The Lord Chancellor is suggesting—and his Circular to magistrates' clerks was accepted by them and by the Magistrates Association—that magistrates' courts be part of a national courts structure, and with that I would agree. Part X of this Bill puts magistrates' courts under the new local authorities, so that they will face an upheaval twice in the course of a year or two, because the legislation is ill-digested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, my Amendment would give the Government a chance to make up their mind on what shall be done about magistrates' courts—whether they agree with the Secretary of State for the Environment or with the Lord Chancellor—so that these magistrates' clerks and their staff's know what will happen and can plan their future. These are some of the instances where the Government have got themselves into a complete muddle with this Bill and with their own policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not an Opposition Member's job to get the Government out of a muddle,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>357</span>
and, if it were only that, I do not think the matter would be as serious as the point I now wish to make. What the Government have succeeded in doing is to get local government in a muddle. There are local government officers who are quite unaware of what will happen to them within the next few years. This applies from the town clerk and borough treasurer clown to the humblest servant of a local authority. They do not know which authority they will be in; they do not know how staff changes will affect them. Their jobs are at stake, and what is the Government's answer? They say "We are setting up a Commission.". Clauses 239 and 240 relate to staff commissions for England and Wales. Note the numbers of these Clauses, because we shall be discussing these in the dim, distant future at the rate we are progressing. But until such time local authority officers do not know what their future will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this Amendment is accepted, which puts all the dates one year back, at least officers will have the opportunity in advance, before they go into the new structure of local government, of knowing in some detail what their own future and that of their colleagues will be, and how they individually will fit into the new structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matter under the Bill is the question of finance. Does the Secretary of State really know what an involved and immense task it will be, to transfer the assets and the finances of existing local authorities to their new component local authorities? This will be a tremendous job, and under the terms of the Bill the Secretary of State is expecting the new councils to be in operation in 1973. He is giving us just over a year to get this immense task done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be endless negotiations between local authorities on this matter; parishes will be merged into boroughs, boroughs into counties, and one county transferred to another. All these local authorities have assets; they have municipal and civic assets, charitable trusts. All this will need to be unravelled and sorted out, and I hope that it will be done in a democratic manner by the local authorities concerned. They have no chance to do it; they are being rushed off their feet by the timetable of this Bill. Again, this is ill-considered, undigested legislation. I do not think that the Secretary of State
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>358</span>
has any conception of the accounting and of the involvement there will be over the transfer of assets between one local authority and another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the right hon. Gentleman to reconsider the dates by which he wants this local government to be reorganised, and to put off the dates for 12 months. Twelve months' delay is all that this side of the Committee is asking for, to give local authority officers a chance to know what will happen about their future, to give local authority treasurers a chance to know what will happen with the assets of their local authority and how they will merge between one authority and another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee know what it has been like during the last few weeks: 50 per cent. of Members' mail at present is coming from urban districts, rural districts and parishes that they have never heard of in their lives, appealing to us as members of the Committee to put forward important considerations, where usually there has been a unanimous decision of councils of all parties. There is no chance, under the speed with which the Secretary of State is trying to rush the Bill through, to consider these representations properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hark back to the question of democracy. If we really believe in democracy, we ought to be considering carefully the views and representations of the councillors of the areas concerned, because we are affecting their areas of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all these reasons, I think no harm would come from delaying the whole timetable by 12 months, delaying all local elections by 12 months, to give an opportunity to the Government to put their house in order and to know exactly what they want to do; to give local authorities and their officers a chance to make representations and to make provision for the new authorities in the future. I appeal particularly to the Government that local government officers at all levels should have some knowledge of what is to happen to them and their jobs in 1973.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) on the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two points. First, I want to strengthen his argument in the matter of representations. I have noted that in many of the representations we are receiving—and I agree with my hon. Friend that they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>359</span>
are taking up a large part of our correspondence, and that they are thorough and voluminous—we are told that in the limited time available they have done what they can to get an expression of public views about the proposals, but because of the limitation of time they have not been able to do more than take a sample of opinion. We have received many complaints about the difficulty of finding adequate opportunity for discussion within the limits of the timetable imposed by the Government, and I fully agree with my hon. Friend on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of great concern that we should be faced with having to deal with arguments from almost every urban and rural district council in the land, and we are not adequately briefed to deal with them in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is on a matter in which I have always taken a considerable interest. Part IX of the Bill—in particular Clauses 177 and 178—refers to the problems of the National Parks, and the considerable reorganisation to their administration that is proposed. We are faced with a somewhat extraordinary situation. The Government have established a committee under Lord Sandford to examine the future of the national parks, and that committee is still taking evidence; yet the Bill contains detailed proposals which intimately affect the whole problem of the National Parks and their working. The Government have imposed dates for the passage of the Bill. The Sandford Committee has said that it does not wish to take evidence specifically on the administrative side; yet every bit of evidence that I have seen—and I have seen most of what has been submitted—inevitably deals with matters affected by the Bill, and it is impossible to separate the two issues. This is one example of one part of the Bill, where I happen to have special knowledge of what is happening, and a further example of the impossibility of sticking to the programme and the timetable imposed by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must review this, and accept the Amendment, or explain how he is to reconcile the timetable with all the arguments we are putting forward. We shall be glad to hear how the Minister proposes to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in complete agreement with my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkin-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>360</span>
sop) on National Parks. I do not have his knowledge of the subject, but he will be interested to hear that only this morning f had a letter from a constituent who feels most strongly about the way in which the National Parks have been treated in the Bill, and says that there should be a proper inquiry and a satisfactory solution before any decision is made about the long-term future of our National Parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage our local authorities are working under considerable difficulties to carry out and prepare for the reorganisation, even before they know the boundaries, which are unlikely to be known until March or April of next year. This is the greatest reorganisation of local government for a century, and yet our local authorities are to be rushed through it in a most undignified manner. I know that in certain areas, the metropolitan districts, the boundaries are known, and are set out in a Schedule to the Bill. Standing conferences have been set up for the existing local authorities which are beginning to work, but that is not true of all the metropolitan districts. My own constituency straddles two metropolitan districts. One has set up a standing conference, and is getting under way with the preparations, whilst the other has not moved as fast. The date of 1974 is far too soon for this Measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a metropolitan district in the Greater Manchester area, 	<i>District</i> (.), outside my constituency, which has special problems which the Minister should take into account when he is deciding on dates. At this stage the district does not include a single county borough, and has no experience. If the Bill goes through, in 1974, that district, which does not include a single borough, and is therefore without the relevant experience, is to be responsible for education, for planning and for other matters. It is not a question of authorities which come from the one county, and which have worked together in the same county council in the past. In Metropolitan 	<i>District</i> (.) there are boroughs and urban districts from Lancashire, Ashton-under-Lyne and Mossley, and other boroughs and urban districts from Cheshire, Hyde, Stalybridge and Dukinfield. If an Amendment which I have tabled is included, there will be boroughs, and rural parishes from Derbyshire. Functions which have been administered from Stockport, Preston
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0202">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>361</span>
and Matlock, such as education and planning, will be transferred to an authority with no experience whatever in such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To try to do that in the short period allowed by the Bill is ludicrous. I have mentioned one metropolitan district, Greater Manchester 	<i>District</i> (.), with no experience of these important services, and if we rush at things in this way, the quality of the service, despite the great efforts of local government officers, will be worse than it should be, and worse than the people deserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will look at it again, and ensure that during this difficult transitional period and beyond, the quality of local government services is maintained. He can do this by accepting the Amendment and delaying implementation until 1975.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment pinpoints much of the concern which has been expressed during all the previous Sittings. We are unhappy at the state of frustration which can be sensed in many local authorities up and down the country. I have said several times that the Bill was hurriedly prepared, and my own town clerk in The Hartlepools has said specifically that the number of problems facing him and his council leads him to believe that the Bill has been brought before the House ill-prepared, and showing insufficient care in the details of many matters of local government administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the state of non-preparedness, we are concerned at the lack of consultation. I have looked at the White Paper, Cmnd. 4584, which I should like to quote. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Without doubt the opportunities for local authorities to take the vital decisions that affect their areas are more exciting now than at any other time".</p></blockquote>
I cannot vouch for the excitement, but local authorities are so concerned and upset that not one hon. Member of the Committee could honestly claim that he has the capacity or the staff to deal with the number of representations that have been made to him. It is not a state of excitement, as per the White Paper, but a state of utter chaos.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to challenge the Government on consultation, which needs time. The White Paper continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The pace of change and the scale of technological control over that change is such that men
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>362</span>
and women in local government can influence the environment in which they and their children will live in a way that has never been open to previous generations".</p></blockquote>
Technological change is rapid, and many of us find that it takes daily attention even to keep pace with the changes in terminology. We have no quarrel with that, but it is important not to hasten legislation in the area of administration and thereby miss the opportunity of giving more care to the problems of technological change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government are determined to play their part in creating the administrative framework within which the real challenges can be met in a way that matches the scale of the problems".</p></blockquote>
If the Government are anxious to do just that, Parliamentary experience has shown that haste is bad. Hon. Members on this side, and some hon. Members opposite who have spoken on community councils have indicated that there is room for greater care, more consultation, more rethinking, and that all needs extra time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to interrupt the hon. Gentleman unnecessarily, but I hope he does not intend to read through the whole White Paper. I am sure that every paragraph of it can be associated with time in one way or another. We are on the rather narrow point whether the Bill should be delayed for one year, from 1974 to 1975, and it would be unfair to work through the White Paper paragraph by paragraph.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You need not worry, Sir Stephen. There are 63 paragraphs in the White Paper, and I have quoted a part of paragraph 5. I now intend to quote a part of paragraph 59. The matter is important. If the Government say something in a White Paper, we want to know that they mean what they say. I quote from paragraph 59, which is a conclusion to the thinking behind the White Paper:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In preparing their proposals for the first comprehensive local government reform of this century, the Government have sought to balance complementary and conflicting factors. Decisions will be taken by those most directly affected and every encouragement will be given to local democracy".</p></blockquote>
I put it to the Minister. Are the Government doing that? Are those who are affected being considered in this way? If I might quote one more sentence:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>363</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The boundaries must be accepted as sensible by people on the spot".</p></blockquote>
That is what the Government have said in Parliament, to the nation, to every local government councillor and town clerk in England and Wales, and yet they are not doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know an education officer who is spending much of his time in attempting to meet the Government's requirements in their proposals for local government reorganisation. Anyone who knows the function of a chief education officer in a local authority is well aware of the complications and arduous tasks he has to undertake. In addition to these, that education officer is working so many hours over and above those necessary to meet his ordinary administrative duties that he is practically ill, and all on account of an anxiety to get things tidy, to get things ready to move over in a situation where no firm decision has been made by the Committee or by Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my own area many of the problems are caused by two factors, one of them the recent amalgamation of The Hartlepools in 1967, when the Government of the day and the officers of the Department, who are still there, made it quite clear, while Maud was sitting, that the amalgamation was based on a boundary concept to provide a local authority unit which was efficient and which would be so for some years to come. In addition to that, on Tees-side, a similar amalgamation of local authorities with the same concept—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have a discussion of the boundaries of the different authorities. We are concerned with an important but a narrow point, as to the year in which the Bill is to come into operation—1974 or 1975. References to individual subjects to stress importance may reasonably be made, but I do not think one should go into the boundaries of districts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>364</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Your point is worth noting, Sir Stephen. I was drawing to a conclusion on that very matter. Where the principle of changing local authority boundaries is proposed in the Bill in the time-scale involved, it conflicts with recent decisions affecting two major authorities. That is my point, and you are quite right, Sir Stephen, that we should not take it too far. However, hon. Members on this side of the Committee must be excused in their emphasis of it because of the obduracy of the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far the Minister has shown little indication of responding to the many reasonable requests that we have made. My hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) has not raised a narrow point. It is a major point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I correct the hon. Gentleman. He must not represent the Chair. I have said it was a narrow debating point, but that the point was important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As long as we get our priorities right, Sir Stephen, none of us will be unhappy. You are quite right. It is an important point, and I suggest that it is not a narrow debating point. With great respect, the indications of the importance of the debating points must arise from the genuine concern of hon. Members. Hon. Members on this side of the Committee at least—so far we have had a quiet breakthrough from the opposite side—are satisfied that the representations made to us—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
