	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>—(	<i>4th July</i>)—That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are to consider at the same time the following new Clauses:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 5—	<i>"Finding of fact to be conclusive"</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The provisions contained in section 75(1) of the National Insurance Act 1965, and the corresponding provision in section 50(1) of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1965, that the decision of a claim or question as there mentioned is to be final shall make any finding of fact or other determination embodied in or necessary to a decision, or on which it is based, conclusive for the purpose of any further decision".</p></blockquote>
New Clause 6—" 	<i>Decision on origin of injury or disability</i> "—
	<br><blockquote><p>"A decision (given under section 48(2) of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1965 or otherwise) that an accident was an industrial accident is to be taken as determining the origin of any injury or disability suffered by the claimant".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Barbara Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 5 is an alien intruder in a Bill designed to better the lot of the casualties in our society, to make better provision for the old, sick, unemployed, widows, disabled and industrially injured. While the rest of the Bill seeks to improve the eligibility rules of some of these categories and the payments to all of them, sitting like a cruel cuckoo in the nest is Clause 5, which is designed to weaken the rights and lessen the opportunities of justice for injured workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Secretary of State made a fairly short and, to the ordinary person, obscure reference to the purposes of Clause 5. At that time, having read the Bill hurriedly and listening to the Secretary of State in slight bewilderment, I was unaware of its significance. I believe
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>358</span>
that I am correct in saying that no great attention was directed to this subject during the Second Reading debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members will turn to column 720 of HANSARD of 18th May, where the Secretary of State deals with Clause 5, they will be little wiser at the end of the reading those four or five paragraphs than they are now. It was not until trade unions and their legal advisers approached trade union Members and other Opposition Members that the Clause was studied in depth and that what we were asked to do in passing Clause 5 became clear to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am certain that it is not clear to hon. Members on the Government benches and that shortly they will be loyally behind the Secretary of State when the Clause is put to the Committee. Therefore, I wish to spend a little time spelling out just what we are being asked to do, because this is one of the most important Clauses of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5 has one sole purpose and effect. It is to overrule decisions in the House of Lords, such as in the case of Mr. Dowling, Mr. Hudson and Mr. Jones, three injured workmen who, having been awarded injury benefit, had to fight the hon. Gentleman's Department all along the line to get disablement benefit. Although we shall oppose the Clause tooth and nail, we believe that that will not be enough and that is clear, following these recent legal cases, that we must remove any dubiety from the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that so much litigation has had to take place to establish what the law was intended to mean proves that the law should be clarified, which is why we have suggested new Clauses 5 and 6. If we are successful in removing Clause 5, I understand that it will be in order to vote on our two new Clauses. But if the Committee overrules our opposition to Clause 5, we shall not have the opportunity to vote on the new Clauses under the rules of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put that on record, because new Clauses 5 and 6 are an integral part of our case, which we put seriously and with sincerity. I should not like it to be assumed from the fact that there is no Division on the new Clauses that we had lost interest in our proposals, or ceased to think that they were vital. The present law must be clarified one way or the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Mr. Paul Dean)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent</i>.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0757">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>359</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that the hon. Member agrees with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's Department, having been defeated in its interpretation by the House of Lords, now says, "That will never do. These injured workmen have got away with their claim. We'll put a stop to that in future." By Clause 5, the Government seek to clarify the law contrary to the long-established rights of injured workmen. The Opposition, by new Clauses 5 and 6, wish decisively to clarify the law in their favour, so that tortuous legal battles will not take place in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I look at the enormous expense to which trade unions have been put in taking such cases through the whole panoply of the law, I believe that the case for new Clauses 5 and 6 is unanswerable. In instancing some of the legal battles that have raged over entitlement to help injured workers, I shall cover a number of years, going back to the period of the Labour Government. Some of these battles were fought when we were in office; some more recently. In some of these cases the DHSS, or its predecessor Ministries, opposed the workmen's claims and the unions' arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a Labour Government introduced the far-reaching, radically reforming Industrial Injuries Act, 1946, establishing such basic principles as the finality of decision, now set at risk by Clause 5, it is obvious that what has happened has been that subsequent Labour Ministers were persuaded by their Departments to appeal against the principle of the finality of decisions. These are examples where bureaucracy can take control. I know, because I was a Minister, how dependent a Minister is upon Departmental advice in such expert matters. I believe that Ministers like my right hon. Friend, Miss Herbison at that time, who by name was involved in one of these legal disputes, would have been aghast if they had realised to what they were lending themselves in wishing to fight an injured workman's claim. It is imperative to apply the law positively so that no civil servant and no Departmental legal adviser can conduct the sort of campaign that has been conducted in these cases and other cases that I shall put before the Committee this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two major issues are involved in Clause 5 and new Clauses 5 and 6. The first is the need to establish that an industrial
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>360</span>
accident has taken place. This is crucial to all other claims for benefit. The 1965 Industrial Injuries Act is a purely consolidating Act, merely consolidating the principles of the 1946 Act and later insurance Acts, and so when talking of the 1965 Act, I am talking of the intentions all along the line from the initiation of the legislation on industrial injuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 48 of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act, 1965, entitles a worker to obtain a declaration that the accident he has suffered is an industrial accident. He is entitled to obtain such a declaration irrespective of whether any industrial injury benefit may be payable at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The declaration is of great importance to the worker, because, even if he is not claiming benefit at that time, his condition may deteriorate later, when the records have been lost. All of us have had examples of constituents saying, "I have developed such and such a condition", and "I remember falling a year ago and I believe that this condition springs from an accident I had at work". We know how difficult it is to go back to establish these claims. Therefore, since a man's condition may deteriorate in later years when the records have been lost, the fact that he has a declaration establishing that he has had an industrial accident is vital to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a second situation, in a sense more tragic, where such a declaration is imperative. The injured man may die and his widow may be seeking an industrial death benefit on the ground that his injury arose through the fault of his employer and that he died from the industrial injury, or from the effects of that injury. The intentions of Parliament in 1946, as repeated in 1965, are clear. Section 48(2) of the 1965 Act reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… any person suffering personal injury by accident shall be entitled, if he claims the accident was an industrial accident, to have the question determined, and a declaration made and recorded accordingly,".</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members opposite are a jury this morning. I hope that they will try to understand the seriousness of the case I am trying to make. Clause 5 is so detailed that I doubt whether they will have appreciated its importance. Surely the intention of stating
	<br><blockquote><p>"… any person suffering personal injury by accident shall be entitled, if he claims the accident was an industrial accident, to have that question determined, and a declaration made and recorded…"
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0758">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>361</span>
was overwhelmingly clear. Yet those words are the subject of dispute, and an interpretation is to be placed upon them in Clause 5 which invalidates the intentions of Parliament since the introduction of industrial injury legislation.</p></blockquote>
Section 48(4) of the Industrial Injuries Act further says that any such declaration
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be conclusive for the purposes of any claim for benefit in respect of that accident,…"</p></blockquote>
Again, I should have thought that that was self-evident. How has it worked in practice? As I said earlier, a Departmental spokesman can sometimes impose an administrative bias that works in an entirely different way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the first of the recent cases—that of Mr. Dowling—which have inspired the introduction of Clause 5. I assume that the hon. Gentleman does not deny—it was clear from the Secretary of State's remarks on Second Reading—that it was the House of Lords judgment in the case of Mr. Dowling, as well as other cases to which I intend to refer, which led to the formulation of the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Dowling met an accident at work in August, 1961. He was lifting a heavy flagstone when he felt a pain in his chest. He was certified unfiit to work, and was found to be suffering from a small hiatus hernia. He claimed injury benefit, but his claim was disallowed. He appealed to a local tribunal, but his appeal was dismissed. His union, which fought the case from the outset, appealed to the commissioners, and the case was heard in London before Mr. Nelson, the union being represented by counsel. A consultant chest physician was brought from Blackpool to give evidence. As will be realised, the cost to the union of fighting such a case was considerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministry, as it then was, went to enormous lengths to oppose Mr. bowling's claim. It mobilised doctors, solicitors and counsel. If Mr. Dowling had not been supported by the union, he would have been in a bad way. The commissioner, Mr. Nelson, allowed the appeal, and gave Mr. Dowling a declaration that his accident was an industrial accident—in other words, that the hernia had been caused by the lifting—and awarded him injury benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 50(1) of the 1965 Act—the provisions of which are again the subject of Clause 5—states explicitly:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… any decision of a claim or question in accordance with this Part of this Act shall be final."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>362</span>
Thus, one of the important issues upon which hon. Members are being asked to vote this morning is whether Section 50 of the 1965 Act, which incorporates one of the central doctrines of the 1946 Act on the finality of decisions, should now be overruled. That would be the effect of our passing Clause 5. That has been the subject of all the argument over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The doctrine of finality of decisions should have settled the case. The man had gone to the commissioner, who had ruled in his favour that he had had an industrial accident, because he ruled that the hernia had been caused by the lifting. Surely it is in accordance with Section 50 of the 1965 Act that that decision should be final: but not a bit of it. This is the kind of situation that I had not appreciated, and I am sure that many other Members had not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second aspect is the finality of decisions. Having been given a declaration that he had had an industrial accident and having been awarded injury benefit, in due course Mr. Dowling went on to claim disablement benefit. He was examined by a medical board, which decided that the hernia was not caused by the lifting and therefore Mr. Dowling had not had an accident. Finality of decision? It would seem to the ordinary person that either the commissioner ought never to have given the injury benefit or that the disablement benefit should have followed automatically, the condition still being there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was only the beginning of the legal battle that the man then had to undertake. With the help of his union, he appealed to a medical tribunal, which confirmed the medical board's finding. He then appealed to the commissioner—not Mr. Nelson this time, but a Mr. Neligan—and the union pointed out that if Mr. Nelson had rejected Mr. Dowling's claim for injury benefit, his claim for disablement benefit would have fallen automatically. He would have been told that as he was not entitled to injury benefit, clearly he could not be entitled to disablement benefit. He would not have had the declaration and the acceptance that the condition was caused by the accident. Why should the vast Department of State be allowed a second bite at the cherry? Why should Mr. Dowling or any other injured workman be put at peril a second time on the same question of fact?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to consider the balance of power involved here. On the one hand, there is an injured workman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0759">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>363</span>
He may or may not have a powerful union behind him as, thank heaven, Mr. Dowling had. Against him there is the panoply of a Department of State that is using public money to employ medical advisers, legal counsel and all the rest to have a second go at the injured workman who has already won his claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that point, the Ministry argued against what I call the doctrine of origin that is enunciated in the new Clauses. It would seem to any fair-minded layman that if a workman has been given a declaration that he has had an industrial accident, that should be conclusive: but not a bit of it. The Ministry's expert representatives argued that the medical appeal tribunal had been right in ruling that Mr. Dowling had not had an accident at all. They said that all that the law meant was that although an accident is conclusive and binding on a medical appeal tribunal, it did not mean that the claimant had had an accident, but merely that if he did have an accident, it would have been an industrial accident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the arguments available to hon. Members in the legal documents. Is not this typical of the tortuous inhumanity of the bureaucratic mind? Did Parliament really mean when it passed the Acts of 1946 and 1965, that if a man claimed that he had had an industrial accident and had a right to a declaration to that effect, the declaration did not establish that he had had an accident, but that, if he had had an accident, it would have been an industrial accident?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what is at issue this morning. This is the new doctrine which Parliament is asked to embody in Clause 5. If Members vote for it, they will be voting for that kind of rigmarole. They will be voting to put workmen endlessly at risk of arguments with the Ministry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was even more alarming was that the second Commissioner, Mr. Neligan, dismissed Mr. Dowling's appeal. I ask the Committee to take this on board. When a workman has to appeal, re-appeal and counter-appeal and go to different tribunals, medical or legal tribunals, or statutory authorities, he gets conflicting verdicts according to the statutory authority or medical authority to which he goes. The hon. Gentleman may try to quote that in aid of his defence. He may say, "They can all be wrong, so it is only right for the Ministry to say, 'The previous
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>364</span>
decision was all wrong, so let us have another.'"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What this means is that no medical tribunal is necessarily sacrosanct and that the Ministry is claiming the right to take a workman through tribunal after tribunal and court after court until it gets the verdict that rules out the workman's claim. I shall proceed to prove it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the commissioner, Mr. Neligan, taking a different line from the commissioner, Mr. Nelson, dismissed Mr. Dowling's claim. But the union was determined not to give up. It went to the Court of Appeal, which decided in Mr. Dowling's favour by two judges to one. Mr. Dowling received his disablement benefit and special hardship allowance. But the Ministry did not intend to give up. Someone had got away with an entitlement which officialdom thought might have been over-generous, although the first decision had been in the man's favour. So the Ministry went to the House of Lords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again I ask the Committee to realise the disparity of power. What would have happened to Mr. Dowling if he had gone to the House of Lords? The House of Lords dismissed the Ministry's appeal by four to one. In other words, the House of Lords accepted that, when a claimant is granted an accident declaration, it meant that the claimant had had an accident and not merely that, if he had had an accident, it would have been an industrial accident. Indeed, Lord Hodson pointed out that an accident declaration which did not mean that the claimant had had an accident would have been of precious little value to him and would have put him in the position at a later date, when his evidence might no longer be available and the records might have been destroyed, of trying to establish the facts in support of his claim years afterwards. Lord Hodson also pointed out that the injured man might die.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Hodson went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… if the claimant were the widow seeking a death benefit under the Act the declaration to the limited effect contended for by the Minister might well be valueless".</p></blockquote>
On Second Reading the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 5 does no more than restore the position to what it was originally believed to be"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 18th May, 1972; Vol. 837, 	<i>c</i>. 721.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0760">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>365</span>
Believed by whom? Certainly not by the Labour Government which introduced the original industrial injuries legislation. That Act has been reaffirmed without challenge in the consolidating Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why would a Labour Government as part of their whole apparatus of rescuing injured workmen from all the legal uncertainties of the old Workmen's Compensation Act introduce the right to an accident declaration which turned out to be valuless? That would not make sense. What is the point of Section 48 of the 1965 Act if it was not intended to mean what new Clause 6 says it means?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the point of repeating in Section 48,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any person suffering personal injury by accident shall be entitled, if he claims the accident was an industrial accident, to have that question determined and a declaration made and recorded accordingly"</p></blockquote>
if the Minister can later say that an accident declaration does not mean that the workman had an accident, but merely that if he had an accident, it would have been an industrial accident, although the Ministry says that he never had an accident? The Ministry says, "Sorry, we thought that point was determined and established a long time ago: we have the right to take the man through the courts till the end of time, till we win." Our new Clause 6 is designed to make the point clear in the man's favour and in the sort of terms that Lord Hodson spelled out in the House of Lords. Its purpose is to ensure that an accident declaration is of value to the workman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Committee can appreciate the bitterness of trade unions on this score. They deal with injured members at first hand in hundreds and thousands. They thought that Parliament's intentions were clear. The Labour Government's intentions were clear in 1946, but now there will be legal hairsplitting at enormous cost to establish a decision contrary to Parliament's intentions. The unions say, "You then tell us that we don't respect the law, and yet the Department of Health and Social Security has not respected the law."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department has continued to try to twist the law in the direction it wants, using public money to employ every expensive device to do the injured workman out of his entitlement. The Department has never accepted the House of Lords ruling in the Dowling case. The proof of that lies in Clause 5. So furious were the Government
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>366</span>
with the House of Lords ruling in the Dowling case that they said, "We must change this law. We are not having this nonsense." They never accepted it. They have seized every opportunity arising from slight differences between the Dowling case and other cases to re-argue the whole issue, despite the House of Lords judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They did so in the case of Mr. Jones and Mr. Hudson, two workmen who were awarded injury benefit for myocardial infarction. However, when they claimed disablement benefit, there was a repetition of the Dowling case. The medical appeal tribunal decided that the heart condition in each case was not caused by the accident. Once again, the union fought the cases through the commissioner, the High Court and the Court of Appeal, finally taking the Department to the House of Lords, in order to get the medical appeal tribunal's verdict overruled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State argued on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would be most unsatisfactory to bind medical practitioners and consultants who compose the boards and tribunals to accept findings contrary to their medical judgment …"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 18th May, 1972; Vol. 837, 	<i>c</i> 721.]</p></blockquote>
Why should it be unsatisfactory? As the evidence of the conflict of findings in these cases to which I have referred reveals, medical boards and tribunals are not infallible. The hon. Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford) will be the first to admit that medical questions can be highly controversial and that different opinions may be held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With all respect to the medical profession, what interests me is the number of times doctors will admit privately that they just do not know. After all, they do not possess some final, divine wisdom. The Under-Secretary may not agree, but I maintain, and, he may recoil again, that there is no good reason why doctor's medical judgment should be preferred to that of the statutory advisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

point out that Clause 5 admits exactly that. Clause 5(1) says not merely that the decisions of non-medical authorities should not be binding on medical authorities—there would at least be some consistency if that were the case—but that the decisions of the medical authority will not be binding on the non-medical authority. Why, then, the Secretary of State's horror that medical practitioners and consultants should be expected to accept verdicts contrary to their medical judgment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause can only mean that the Department wants the right to continue endlessly to contest decisions given in the claimant's favour until they give up in despair, or the Department finds a medical board or tribunal to give it the verdict it seeks, even if it should contradict the finding of an earlier medical board or tribunal. What matters to the Department is the finding rather than by whom it was given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here I cite the example of another hiatus hernia case when a medical authority found in the man's favour, which decision was later reversed by a non-medical authority. Did the Minister dispute that decision on the grounds that the medical judgment of the medical tribunal was superior to the judgment of a non-medical tribunal? Not a bit of it, simply because the verdict was the one the Department wanted, namely, against the man. The Ministry did not protest against this case, yet to justify its silence the Secretary of State would have to stand the arguments on their heads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give details of the case, which is outlined in Decision R(I)11/61 published by the Stationery Office. I suggest that hon. Members obtain copies and study it. In October, 1957, the claimant was lifting a heavy weight with a block and tackle when he felt a stabbing pain in his stomach. However, he continued to work and did not claim injury benefit. A year later he was admitted to hospital and was operated on for hiatus hernia. The insurance officer found that the man had suffered an industrial accident in October, 1957. A medical board found that the hernia was caused by the accident and assessed the resultant disablement at 100 per cent. from the time of the accident. This, one would think, had settled the matter. The Ministry could have appealed against the finding of the medical board, but it did not. Therefore the decision of the medical board was final
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>368</span>
on any reasonable interpretation of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few weeks later the man died, as a result of pulmonary embolism, a complication of the operation to repair the hernia. His wife claimed industrial death benefit, the appeal tribunal finding in her favour. The case was then taken to the commissioner, presumably by the Ministry, although the Ministry had not appealed against the previous medical board's decision and, therefore, had no complaint about the decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commissioner found that the insurance officer's finding—that the claimant's husband had suffered an industrial accident—was valid, but that the decision of the medical board that the incident had caused the hiatus hernia was not. A senior medical officer of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance as it then was produced a great deal of evidence on the man's medical history and what his workmates were supposed to have said about his condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The man was dead. He could not defend himself against the evidence brought by the senior medical officer of the MPNI. Evidence had not been brought earlier when the appeal should have been made. Yet, although the man was dead, his widow had to fight for the death benefit, She was alone and bewildered and the man who could provide the evidence of his disease was dead. Yet the commissioner accepted the evidence of the senior medical officer in the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commissioner found:
	<br><blockquote><p>"whereas the operation was necessary for the repair of the hernia and the pulmonary embolism which caused the deceased's death was a complication of that operation, the accident did not cause or aggravate the hernia."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Committee will agree that it is nauseous that, the Ministry having failed to appeal against the original medical verdict, it could then re-open the whole medical case after a man's death in order to do his widow out of her death benefit. I hope, too, that in the light of that case the Committee will be able to assess the oddity of the Secretary of State's claim that it would be unsatisfactory for medical tribunals to have their medical judgments overridden by the statutory authorities. But that is just what happened in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This case occurred before the House of Lords ruling in the Dowling case, or in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0762">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>369</span>
cases of Hudson and Jones. If it had come afterwards, the widow would almost certainly have got the death benefit. It is to make sure that people like her do not get their death benefit that Clause 5 has been introduced. The purpose of the Clause is to allow that kind of case to occur again despite the House of Lords ruling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simple issue before us is whether, faced with the express provision in the Act that
	<br><blockquote><p>"any decision of a claim or question … shall be final",</p></blockquote>
that provision should be amended by Clause 5 to enable the Department to go on endlessly re-opening and re-arguing issues until it obtains the verdict against the claimant that it wants. Of course there must be provision for cases to be reviewed by a medical board. Section 40 of the 1965 Act provides for that in two circumstances: first, a decision may be reviewed where fresh evidence has come to light which seems to indicate non-disclosure of certain crucial information; secondly, an assessment may be reviewed where "unforeseen aggravation" has taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in the case that I mentioned no such review was called for by the Ministry. There was merely the cavalier reversal of a decision which, if Section 50 means anything, should have been final. Indeed, when an injured workman asks for his assessment to be reviewed on the grounds of "unforeseen aggravation", again the Department pursues him relentlessly until it gets him down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the case of another Mr. Jones, Mr. G. T. Jones of Maesteg. He is almost blind, nearly 70 per cent. disabled, and he receives no disablement benefit. I shall not weary the Committee with the details of the case. The crucial point is this. It is conceded that Mr. Jones met with an industrial accident in February, 1953. In 1961, he claimed disablement benefit for uritis and he was assessed at 4 per cent. for life by a medical appeal tribunal—one of those bodies whose medical judgment, we are told, should prevail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1969, he applied for a review of that assessment on the grounds of unforeseen aggravation, and the medical board increased the assessment to 70 per cent. The Department appealed, of course, and the medical appeal tribunal reversed the decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The union took up the case. The commissioner twice accepted the union's
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>370</span>
appeal and twice the case was sent back for re-hearing by medical appeal tribunals. On one occasion, the commissioner sent the case back on the grounds that the medical tribunal had not given adequate reasons for its decision. In March, 1972, the third tribunal again found that there had been no aggravation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This time, under pressure from the commissioner, it set out its reasons. The tribunal argued that there had been no aggravation, not on the grounds that the man was no worse, but by re-opening the whole of the original issue, namely, whether the eye condition was caused or partly caused by his accident, which had previously been decided by a medical authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tribunal went right back to square one. It drew attention to the report of a consultant, Mr. Pillai. That report had been available before the medical appeal tribunal of 1961 which had found in Mr. Jones's favour. Mr. Pillai had argued in his report that the uritis was not caused by the accident but merely aggravated by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1961 tribunal had rejected that argument. Yet another medical appeal tribunal, which was supposed to be dealing with aggravation and nothing else, decided to accept Mr. Pillai's argument and to say, in effect, that the uritis had never been caused by the accident and that the worsening of the man's condition was therefore constitutional in origin, and the appeal was rejected. So here we have a situation in which a medical appeal tribunal in 1972 rejected the finding of a medical appeal tribunal in 1961 on the basis of a report which was not fresh evidence and which had been available to the 1961 tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We argue that under Section 50 of the 1965 Act the findings of the 1961 medical appeal tribunal should have been final. It is intolerable that 11 years later, on the basis of a stale old report, the whole question of the cause of the condition could be re-raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is that just? If the 1961 finding was final, as the Act says it should have been, the 1972 tribunal had no right to resurrect the consultant's old report on the question of the cause of the accident. It should have decided only whether any aggravation had taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is to make absolutely sure that the judgment of the House of Lords does not prevent this happening over and over again that we have Clause 5 and it enables the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0763">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>371</span>
finality of decisions principle to be undermined, whereas New Clause 5 would establish that a decision was indisputable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one medical tribunal can reverse the decision of another, what becomes of the sanctity of medical decisions to which the Secretary of State attaches such importance? What happens when medical practitioners and consultants are forced to accept findings contrary to their medical judgment? In this case, the medical authority was overruled by a non-medical authority. It was a question of the Ministry soldiering on through a welter of medical decisions until it found the one that suited it best. Can the Committee be surprised if unions feel bitter and believe that Clause 5 is just a conspiracy to ensure that a workman never gets the final benefit of a decision in his favour, never gets the benefit of any doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could give hundreds of examples to the Committee, many of them illustrating the point we are trying to make. But before concluding I should like to refer to the case of Mrs. Kingsnorth of Northfleet, Kent. In May, 1963, Mrs. Kingsnorth suffered an industrial accident when she fell and injured her wrist. In September, 1963, a medical board assessed her disablement provisionally at 15 per cent., later reduced to 5 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In January, 1965, Mrs. Kingsnorth applied for a review on the grounds that she was suffering from a detached retina of the left eye. In June of that year, a medical board accepted the eye condition as being relevant to the accident and made a provisional assessment of 30 per cent. for the two conditions. The Minister was entitled to appeal against that decision, but he did not do so, and therefore, under the Act that decision became final.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In September, 1966 a medical board again examined her and made an assessment of 30 per cent. allowance. This time the Ministry agreed. The Ministry accepted as a fact that, during the accident, Mrs. Kingsnorth fell forward and struck her head. But the Ministry argued that, on balance of probability, the detachment of the retina had nothing to do with it. In October, a medical appeal tribunal accepted the Ministry's argument and reduced the assessment from 30 per cent. to three per cent., therefore leaving out the eye condition and giving her an assessment for the wrist only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>372</span>
The union applied for leave to appeal and, in granting it, the medical appeal tribunal disclosed the full reasons for its decision. Hon Members can read the decision, which includes the following words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Tribunal considered the claimant to be quite unreliable as a witness. They did not believe that she had suffered a retinal detachment until several months had elapsed after the accident".</p></blockquote>
That is a pretty damning indictment. To be called a very unreliable witness on public record is a serious matter for anyone. However, the commissioner did not consider that the reasons of the medical tribunal were sufficiently clear and unambiguous, and so he gave the union the right to appeal to himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the commissioner, the union argued that the decision of the medical board in June, 1965, was final and binding on the later tribunal because no appeal was made against it. The commissioner rejected that argument, thus throwing the whole value of Section 5 of the Act in doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What saved Mrs. Kingsnorth was the fact that, by almost a miracle, the union was able to prove that she was telling the truth. It was able to produce three witnesses to the fact that she had banged her head and had complained to them afterwards of pain in the area of the retinal detachment. As a result, she was sent back to a medical tribunal which, in April, 1969, made an assessment of 40 per cent. for life. Today she is receiving disablement pension and a special hardship allowance at the maximum rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can we say, therefore, that justice is always done? Can we rest comfortably? The union's solicitors, who have massive first-hand practical knowledge of these cases which we cannot hope to emulate, think differently. They say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Consider the position if the decision of the medical board in 1965 was not final and binding. There could be a series of subsequent provisional assessments. It is not uncommon for as many as four such assessments to be made in succession over a period of five or six years. Mrs. Kingsnorth would be called upon to prove before each successive medical board that when she fell in 1963 she banged her head. Like many truthful witnesses, Mrs. Kingsnorth was unconvincing and made a bad impression. There was no witness who saw her fall, but I succeeded in the end before a medical appeal tribunal in April 1969 because as I have said by a miracle I was able to find and produce three witnesses who could confirm that they saw the mark on her head where she banged it and who remembered hearing her complain
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0764">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>373</span>
of a blurring of the vision in her left eye within a few days of the accident.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the decision of the medical board in 1965 was not final, then Mrs. Kingsnorth would have to take her three witnesses to every medical board and it would be the duty of each medical board in succession to consider whether they were satisfied that she did in fact bang her head when she fell. This would impose an intolerable burden not only on Mrs. Kingsnorth and her witnesses but also on the medical boards which would be called upon years after the event to adjudicate again on a simple question of fact which had been settled and decided long before. And each time the Secretary of State would be entitled to appeal to a medical appeal tribunal and cross-examine Mrs. Kingsnorth and her witnesses and suggest to them that they were not telling the truth or that their recollection was faulty and try to trip them up. This may sound fanciful but in fact this has been done to clients of mine in other cases. Sooner or later the claimant will give up or the witnesses will be lost or a tribunal will be found which will give the Secretary of State the decision he requires. One decision against the claimant is enough. He cannot have a second bite at the cherry. But he can be put in peril again and again and again. The Secretary of State can have a second bite and a third bite and in my experience he will never give up."</p></blockquote>
If the National Insurance Bill is passed as at present drafted, and if a similar case arises in future, if witnesses cannot be found after a lapse of time to prove a case which has already been proved and accepted persons such as Mrs. Kingsnorth can be robbed of their benefits, and insulted and abused into the bargain.

The Clause and our new Clauses are of practical importance at the present time. The Government are trying to mend their relationships with the trade unions. The Prime Minister has had a meeting with the TUC. He has tried to convince the trade unions that we live in a society where justice is done to the most incoherent inarticulate and helpless in our constituencies. I tell the Committee seriously that we do not have a cat in hell's chance of proving that to the trade unions if Clause 5 is passed. The Clause is designed to establish the victory of unimaginative bureaucracy, including the medical establishment, backed by Ministers who are imprisoned within the reasoning of that bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee to realise how unwise it would be to ignore the bitterness which the Clause, with its legitimisation of administrative powers, is causing among trade unionists. I shall quote one letter among many which have been received from trade unions about Clause 5. This letter
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>374</span>
was written by the secretary of the legal department of the Transport and General Workers Union:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It seems that there is one law for the trade unions and one for the Government because we are accused of breaking the law and not accepting it, and a great song and dance is made even to the extent of placing the union in contempt of court. On the other hand, where the Government decide that a House of Lords decision does not suit their purposes, it is decided to change the law to suit themselves, thus bringing themselves into the position of disregarding the law whatever it is."</p></blockquote>
I shall conclude with a quotation from the solicitor to the AEWU and other unions about the significance of the decision we are making this morning. He writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At present I can argue that the decision of the medical authorities is final and binding on the subsequent medical authority. If Clause 5 is passed such decisions will not be binding, and injured persons may be compelled, as I have said, to fight the same battle time and time again before one tribunal after another, year after year, until the Department of Health and Social Security can find a tribunal to give them the decision which they require."</p></blockquote>
In this inevitably technical and complex debate, one simple principle is involved—nothing less than the confidence of the ordinary worker in the fairness of our society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Tom Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) has made a very good case. Whether from a legal, practical or humanitarian point of view, it seems manifestly unjust that anyone should be subjected to being tried on the same charge time and again. As she said, no doctor is infallible. A visit to a 	<i>post-mortem</i> room can reveal how different the pathologist's diagnosis can be from that made by the physician.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not think that the cases which the right hon. Lady raised adequately illustrate the point. Many of us will have had the experience of following the story of our patients or our constituents through from tribunal to tribunal, court to court, and receiving differing opinions. No doubt the hon. Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones) will have experience of many cases concerning chest diseases in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cases referred to by the right hon. Lady were all cases in which it was necessary to decide whether the condition involved was possibly, or probably, caused by an accident. For example, if we were to X-ray the occupants of this Committee
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0765">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

room, particularly the ladies, a large number would be found to have a hiatus hernia. It would be for the medical evidence and the commissioner to decide whether that hiatus hernia was occasioned by, or exacerbated by an injury which occurred during a patient's hours of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Mr. Fortescque) assures me that his wife has a hiatus hernia, as has his mother-in-law. If either were to undergo a traumatic experience on the way downstairs, one must then ask whether she would have any right to claim in law that her condition had been exacerbated or occasioned by the accident, if she had been unaware that she had it already. The hiatus hernia, therefore, presents a difficult medical-legal problem, as does the detached retina. From the facts that were related, I think there can be no doubt that it was exacerbated or occasioned—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I refer back to the hernia case? It may, of course, be argued that a fractured wrist, a detached retina, a hernia, or a strain of the heart can occur in ordinary life. Thus, I do not think that the hon. Gentleman establishes anything by the fact that people who have not had industrial accidents may have a hernia. The point is that certain industrial injury legislation has been established, part of which says that a decision of a claim or question shall be final. In the hernia case, the commissioner, the highest authority, agreed that the accident was an industrial accident and that the hernia had been caused by the lifting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone has to make a decision. Possibly, that decision may be wrong. No one can be sure whose will be the correct decision. But at what stage do we put the workman out of his misery and say, "This decision in your favour is final"? That is what we are talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that is what we are talking about. Indeed, I have already agreed with the right hon. Lady that the problem of whose decision is to be final is basic, and that that final decision, when it comes to be taken, must be rapidly achieved and adhered to thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the question of hiatus hernia, there are many causes for this condition, just as there are many causes for a pain in a man's chest when he is lifting. The two are not necessarily
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>376</span>
related. Personally, if I had looked at the evidence, I think that I would have come down on the side of the medical hierarchy in that case, from a medical point of view. From a legal, humanitarian or practical point of view, I should certainly not think it desirable that the man should be subjected to court after court and tribunal after tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision may well have been wrong. The possibility rather than the probability may have been accepted out of kindliness, or because it was felt that there was a possibility that the injury had been caused through lifting the cover of the well, whatever it was, and that he should be given the benefit of the doubt. On that, I am agreed with the right hon. Lady. However, I disagree with her that this necessarily shows a lack of humanitarianism on the part of those who take such decisions. The system was wrong, but not, I think, the motives which underly it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same criterion applies in respect of the pulmonary embolus. We all know that if we go into hospital to be cut about, most of us will leave without experiencing a pulmonary embolus. However, we also know that, when the houseman comes round to examine patients, he will have a good idea of those who will be at risk from pulmonary embolus. It is a question of possibility and probability, although I agree that there is a possibility that it was entirely occasioned by surgery. But it is a multi-factoral complaint, other factors being his weight, the life he led before the injury, his alcohol intake, diet and whether he had taken plenty of exercise. It is wrong to suggest that they were being unreasonable. The law is unreasonable, not the people who interpret it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument with great care. I accept that medical decisions may be controversial. Therefore, the final one accepted against the man might be as unreliable as that accepted in his favour. But the hon. Gentleman seemed to agree with me that it is wrong, after a decision has been reached—whether the correct one or not—that the man should have to fight it all over again for the rest of his life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentlman said it was not the motives behind those who pursued the man who were wrong but the law. Will he acknowledge that Clause 5 will revert to the position before the House of Lords

ruling, and that, therefore, there will be a right constantly to reopen a decision even when it was in the man's favour?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just coming to that point. Where we have cases where there is possibility and probability, it is right and proper that the commissioner should come down more often than not on the question of possibility rather than probability. Once a final decision has been established, it should be left that way. We should take the opinion expressed in the Lords, by a four to one majority, that this is the humanitarian and practical way to handle it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Marsden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one were to say that this is the morning of 6th July, 1972, the Committee would recognise the truth and finality of that statement. In the same way, one can recognise the truth and finality of the accident book, as a very important document in evidence. In its departments, the Post Office keeps this book under lock and key. All accidents, however trivial, are recorded in it. The date, time, signature of witnesses, and witnesses' written evidence are put in it, and a senior officer inspects it daily. It is what we call the first register. The word "register" is not mentioned in the Bill, or, indeed, in any Acts or documents. Nevertheless, that way of registering an accident has become part of our national life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The accident book is the first important document registering that an accident has occurred and that it is an industrial accident. If a person were absent from work as a result of injury, he would make a declaration that an industrial accident had occurred. Subject to further conditions and medical examination, he would receive his injury benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a person became disabled as a result of his injury, subject to medical examination and certain conditions, he would receive a disablement pension, although he may have had to prove his case all over again. But in all this, the declaration has been a final decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first Industrial Injuries Act was passed in 1946. At that time, the accident declaration meant that one had had an industrial accident. If Clause 5 is passed, an accident declaration will not mean that the claimant has had an accident. It will mean that if—"if" is the operative word—
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>378</span>
he has had an accident it was an industrial accident. There is no finality in that declaration. It even contradicts the important evidence of the accident book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Clause 5 is passed, the final decisions will not be binding. Claimants will be required to fight their cases all over again. If a man was disabled and died, his widow would have to prove the case all over again, would have to prove that an industrial accident had happened. The man, now dead, might have been the only witness. The poor widow and the witnesses would have to go through all that trial and tribulation to get justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Clause 5 is passed, it will tip the scales of justice heavily in favour of the Department. If the scales of justice have to be tipped, they should be tipped in favour of the claimant who has suffered grievous injury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is evident from the contributions from both sides of the Committee that there is considerable dissatisfaction with our present industrial injury scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) said that Clause 5 was an intruder. I agree. But it is more; it is an unobserved intruder, because few people paid much attention to it. The kindest criticism that can be levelled at Clause 5 is that we had insufficient explanation from the Department when it was first introduced. There was nothing in the White Papers. One could not expect there to be, because they were principally concerned with upratings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary, on Second Reading, did not explain Clause 5. He did not have to; no one asked him to. No one on either side of the House focussed attention on the Clause and its implications. The Secretary of State referred to it, but in almost a passing reference, considering its importance. He took up about 35 lines of the OFFICIAL REPORT, and ended his remarks by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 5 does no more than restore the position to what it was originally believed to be, and their Lordships foresaw that amending legislation might well be necessary following their judgment."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 18th May, 1972; Vol. 837, 	<i>c.</i> 721.]</p></blockquote>
Confessing my own ignorance, which, no doubt, was shared by a good many others, those words tended to lull me into a sense of false security as to the full implications of Clause 5.

We now know from approaches which have been made to us that that is not the feeling of trade unions which have to represent workers in claims for industrial benefits. That is not the view, either, of solicitors who specialise in industrial disability matters. I quote one such comment. I shall not name the solicitors, but they are a well known reputable firm frequently engaged in such cases. They say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The statement of Sir Keith Joseph that Clause 5 does no more than restore the position to What it was originally believed to be is of course preposterous. I am quite sure that when the first Industrial Injuries Act was passed in 1946 the Government intended and Parliament intended that when an injured workman was granted an accident declaration this would mean that he had had an accident and also that it was an industrial accident. It is only the perverted mind of a soulless bureaucrat or an ingenious lawyer who could dream up the ludicrous proposition that an accident declaration does not mean that you had an accident but only that if you had an accident it was an industrial accident."</p></blockquote>
It is a question of when is an accident not an accident—or the old question, how long is a piece of string.

Our feelings in the House, where we paid little regard to Clause 5, are not the feelings of people outside the House who are most imtimately involved in the implications of Clause 5. It is an extremely complicated issue, difficult for everyone involved—workers, trade unions, solicitors—and extremely difficult for Members of Parliament whose constituents sometimes bring documents going back years on cases about which they feel so passionately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could have had a far more detailed explanation of the implications behind Clause 5. We had a right to expect this from the Government when they introduced the Bill. It might have been desirable, in view of the feelings aroused by Clause 5, to have had a White Paper on the subject. The Under-Secretary of State will have to do something more on the Clause today. He will have to refute the detailed charges made by my hon. Friend, promise to do something between now and Report, or vote against his own Clause 5 and accept our new Clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All Members of Parliament meet cases where the ordinary workman cannot understand why a decision, having once been made in his favour, is subsequently, perhaps years later, reversed. Those of us representing industrial constituencies, like
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>380</span>
my own in the Rhondda, have many such cases. It becomes almost a lawyer's paradise for workmen trying to get what they regard as a fair deal in industrial cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On many occasions, it seems that common sense disappears out of the window when we are dealing with industrial injuries. Cases drag on for years, I have come across many cases in which it has been impossible to find a witness to an accident. In some cases, the witness has moved away, or has died. With the passage of time, a claimant's own recollection of what happened may be at fault. When one is putting an untrained claimant to give evidence against a trained lawyer representing the Ministry, obviously the dice is loaded in favour of the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One case in particular was mentioned by my right hon. Friend. There are dozens of such cases in the mining valleys. A miner dies, and the widow is left to prove that his disablement was due to an industrial accident, when she is unaware of the circumstances surrounding the accident other than the pieces of information her husband may have explained to her. My right hon. Friend mentioned the case of a namesake of mine from Maesteg, the man who is now almost blind, with 70 per cent. disablement. He sustained the industrial accident in 1953. The medical appeal tribunal awarded 4 per cent. for life in 1961. In 1972, he is called upon to prove all over again, before a different tribunal, the case which he proved satisfactorily to the medical tribunal in 1961.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That case is typical of many in which there is a protracted argument between the claimant and the Department. The time factor is one of the serious problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marsden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard the stress which my hon. Friend has put on this matter, but I should put it more strongly. That case has been going on for 11 years. It is a scandal in our national life that we could not come to finality in eleven years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, but, with the Welshman's modest approach to life, I used the milder word. For the man and his family, it is a public scandal that such a thing should happen. Mr. Jones has been subjected to six different boards and tribunals, and still the case is unresolved. In all such appeals, the dice is inevitably loaded against the claimant. If the claimant

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>381</span>
is fortunate, he has the backing of a union, but there are many cases which would-be claimants cannot pursue because they have not the knowledge or expertise to do so. But the Department uses all the resources of the State, pursuing almost a vendetta against such claimants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one can suggest that we had adequate explanation of the implications of Clause 5, and I look forward to hearing the Under-Secretary's views. My right hon. Friend has put a detailed case. She need not apologise to the Committee for the time taken on it. It is a most important matter, affecting many thousands of people. That case, which has yet to be refuted, is that Clause 5 as it stands will make it more difficult for claimants to succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5 ought not to have been slipped into an uprating Bill. It should have been a separate Measure, so that we should have a fairer chance to debate it and to understand its implications. My right hon. Friend has performed a service to the Committee this morning, and has performed a service to the many claimants who are in difficulties over such cases. I believe it right to oppose Clause 5, and to support our new Clauses 5 and 6. I was pleased to hear the point made by the hon. Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford), who shows a humani tarian approach. He indicated that there is dissatisfaction with the way things are going, and that he would prefer that the claimant be given the benefit of the doubt, the law remaining as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When a case is put by my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle), it is usually put definitively and there is not a great deal left to say or to argue about. Indeed, the Minister has some difficult questions to answer in his reply. However, I intervene briefly because I feel that two or three points should be stressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, on consideration of the explanation of Clause 5 given by the Secretary of State on Second Reading, it is obvious to anyone who has ever worked in a Government Department, particularly to anyone who has worked in the Department of Health and Social Security, as I have, that it was part of the familiar Departmental brief and the Minister was reading it. He was not making a speech but was sticking closely to the brief, read-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>382</span>
ing exactly what it told him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn pointed out at the outset that Clause 5 is an alien element, an interloper in the Bill. It is the kind of Clause that Departments like to tuck away in other legislation, for various reasons. There is always pressure on the Parliamentary timetable. The present Government have managed more than any I can recall to throw their Parliamentary timetable into chaos and confusion, to such an extent that we may have to sit well into August.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Fortescue</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Mr. Fortescue), who is a Whip, should not intervene again. Otherwise, I shall encourage him to break all the rules and make another speech, as he did only the other day. Such Clauses are put in partly because of the demands of the timetable. But there is another reason. Departments like to tuck away Clauses obscurely in Bills that are not directly to the purpose. The Department knows—and the Minister knows, if he has realised it—that what is being introduced here is a highly unpopular and a very doubtful proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State read his brief on Clause 5. I do not accuse him, or the Under-Secretary who is here today, of not having asked what it was all about, but I doubt that there was detailed and extensive discussion and briefing on the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman nods his head to suggest that there was. If that is so, then both he and the Secretary of State should be ashamed of themselves for having been prepared to allow a Clause of such significance to be hidden away in an uprating Bill of this kind. If they had considered the matter extensively, the Secretary of State should have given a far fuller explanation of the purpose of the Clause than the one he gave on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that a large number of Members did not realise what the Clause was all about. It is another of those obscurely drafted Clauses, with the exciting title, "Finality of decisions. 1965 	<i>c.</i> 51." It is not part of the uprating. They assume that it is just a routine administrative Clause, when the opposite is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come from a heavy industrial area,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0769">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>383</span>
an area of coal mines and steelworks, as does my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones). Like every Member from an industrial area, and even from non-industrial areas, I have a constant stream of constituents either writing to me and sending their case papers or calling to see me at my advice bureau on industrial injury matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult enough already for claimants to work their way through the morass of industrial injury legislation. Of course, the proceedings are complex, and difficult medical decisions have to be taken, but, in view of all the difficulties, and the fact that not all claimants have major unions behind them, we must maintain a position in which the claimant will always be given the benefit of the doubt. He is the little man against the massive resources of the Department. He is entering a field, as a layman, which is difficult enough for Members of Parliament who are not qualified in medicine or in the law. If he does not belong to a union, too often he does not get the kind of advice he needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be intolerable if the Committee were to accept a Clause which will mean that, rather than being given the benefit of the doubt if necessary, with the balance of probability in their favour rather than the other way, individuals may be hawked from one tribunal to another and from one law court to another without ever knowing whether any particular decision is final, simply because it does not suit the administrative purposes of the Department of Health and Social Security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Legal tidiness, legal nicety and administrative convenience must always have a place in the consideration of a Department or of an individual. But where there is a conflict of interest between administrative convenience and the advantage of the individual citizen, the Committee should decide that the interests of the individual injured work man or work woman should always come first. If we allow the Clause to reach the Statute Book, we shall allow legal nicety—an intolerable legal nicety, in my view—and administrative convenience to come before suffered injury at work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State, reading his brief on Second Reading, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 5 does no more than restore the position to what it was originally believed to be".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 18th May, 1972; Vol. 837, 	<i>c</i>. 721.]</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>384</span>
Let us examine what the position was originally believed to be—not what the Department wanted it to be but what the 1946 Parliament intended when it passed the legislation. The 1945-50 Parliament was one of the great reforming Parliaments of this century. Members came into a Labour-dominated House from the industrial constituencies in unprecedented numbers, and the House passed extremely important legislation on industrial injuries. Can anyone who remembers the 1945 intake and the Ministers in that Labour Government who were responsible for legislation of this kind believe that this was their intention? I come now to what "this" means, and what the Secretary of State says was the intention of the original Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department said in the Dowling case and subsequent cases that, although an accident declaration is conclusive, it does not mean that the claimant had an accident. It means only that, if he did have an accident, it was an industrial accident. If Clause 5 is passed, an accident declaration will not mean that the claimant has had an accident: it will mean only that, if he had had an accident, it would have been an industrial accident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn made clear what nonsense that was. Does the Under-Secretary think that the 1945–50 Parliament believed that? Does he think that a man like Jim Griffiths, a distinguished Member of the House, or hon. Members on his own side were responsible for considering that 1946 legislation, got themselves involved in that kind of legal nonsense in the circumstances of 1946?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must look at the background of workmen's compensation legislation and the situation in the 1930s and 1940s before the 1946 Act. It is not a legal argument. I am considering what the intention of Parliament was. We are not discussing the matter in a law court, which disregards everything reported in HANSARD. I do not attack the tradition of British justice that it is what is said in a Statute which matters rather than what Ministers thought or said was the intention. If we are considering in Committee the revision or clarification of legislation, we are concerned with what the intention of the 1945–50 Parliament was and with what our intention is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that members of this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0770">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>385</span>
Committee, whether Labour or Conservative—even Conservative Whips—are prepared to pass legislation which provides that an accident declaration is not a declaration that an accident has taken place, it is an industrial accident. That cannot be the intention of the Committee any more than it was the intention of Parliament in 1946.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Members in that Parliament, who came from industrial areas like mine, from the coal mining and steel areas, must have had experience of the iniquitous litigation which became notorious under the old Workmen's Compensation Acts. People were put to intolerable trouble because of the state of the law. That was why the 1946 Act was passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we pass Clause 5 we shall take a backward step. It has nothing to do with political philosophy. There is often a deep philosophical difference between us, and we recognise it. But we are not talking about that this morning; we are talking about the operation of a system which is incomprehensible to the average laymen under which the papers gather over the years and time-scale is not sure. Individual cases of this kind are not dealt with in a week or a month; they may go on for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do we have to stack the deck so much against the individual claimant? He is better off if he has a big union behind him. Some have none. But even a man with a big union behind him can find his case going on for ever. He may die; his wife may die. He may be in real financial difficulty while his claim is being determined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is intolerable that we should take a step backwards towards the conditions of the 1930s rather than towards the conditions which we should be prepared to accept in the 1970s. I ask the Minister, representing his Department, for which I have great respect, to look at this again. The Department may genuinely take the view that it is merely restoring the position to what it was originally believed to be. It is how the Department may have seen the legislation, but it was not how Parliament saw it. It is not what Parliament was doing then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take the Clause away—it will be the first occasion in this Committee—and be prepared to accept
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>386</span>
the new Clauses which could replace it. If he cannot do that, we can discuss the matter on Report. If he will not give an inch of ground today, I hope that, without commitment, he will say that, in view of the opinions which have been expressed and of the substantial and detailed case put by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn, he will at least have further detailed consideration in his Department before Report, so that we may have a full discussion in the House, which will be welcomed by hon. Members who are not members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a debate on this subject lasting almost two hours. The first preference is that the Committee should take a decision. If the hon. Gentleman is not prepared to agree to that, I hope that the House will be given the opportunity of reconsidering the matter on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate on an important Clause, and it is entirely appropriate that the Clause should be covered in Committee, because it was not discussed in detail on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree entirely with one point made by the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle), that it is necessary to clarify the law. This is in the interests of everybody, both existing claimants and possible future claimants. But she is incorrect in saying that the Clause is an alien intruder which will weaken the rights of those who are injured at work. That is not the Government's intention; nor is it the effect of the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention, as my right hon. Friend said on Second Reading, is to restore the position to what it was before. The hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. O'Malley) said that this is, in effect, going back to the workmen's compensation procedure which existed before the war. That is not true. This legislation dates from the 1946 Act, and for a number of years since the passing of that Act the procedure worked without much complaint. The first named case was the Dowling case. Therefore, as I hope to show, the hon. Gentleman is wrong to suggest that we have suddenly gone back to an old position, which will alter the whole structure. In workmen's compensation procedures before the war, finality did lie and largely obtained under the old Workmen's Compensation Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0771">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>387</span>
The 1946 Act introduced the more flexible arrangements which the Clause is designed to confirm. The object of the Clause is to enable justice to be done and to ensure that cases are dealt with on their merits. I hope to show that the position restored by the Clause is in the interests of claimants generally and the speedy settlement of claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hard things have been said about the Department. The job of the Department certainly is not, and never has been, to try to prevent people from obtaining benefit to which they are entitled. The whole administration of the industrial injuries scheme leans over backwards to see that claims get the benefit of the doubt, be it for injury and short-term benefits, or for disablement and other long-term benefits. That is the object of the exercise, and the Department has recourse to the appeal procedures in exactly the same way as any individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Department refers a case to the medical appeal tribunals, it is not with the intention of trying to grab back a benefit from an individual. It is done to ensure consistency of decisions. Sometimes the Department takes cases through the appeal procedure when it feels the assessment is too low. In 1970, in 31.6 per cent. of references to medical appeal tribunals the outcome was favourable to the claimant. This percentage does not suggest a hard-hearted administration, far from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the figure the hon. Gentleman quotes proves his point either way. The hon. Gentleman said that when the Department thinks an assessment is too low, the matter is taken to a tribunal. Can he give the number of cases in recent years when the Department has taken such cases to a tribunal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the precise figure at the moment. The figure I mentioned of cases which have gone in favour of the claimant suggests that the system is not rigged against the claimant, or that the Department tries to do the individual down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not give a figure which is meaningless to his argument. He said that 31 per cent. of references to the tribunal had gone in the claimants' favour. He deduced from that that the Department was not hard-hearted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>388</span>
It only means that in one-third of the cases taken by the Department to the tribunal against the claimant even the tribunal found the Department wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not accept that at all. The Opposition argument, that the system is weighted against the individual, is not correct. The figure I quoted supports my argument conclusively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions in the Clause are concerned primarily with decisions which affect disablement benefit under the Industrial Injuries Act. There is a direct connection in the Clause with the short-term injury benefit and the long-term disablement benefit. Disablement benefit is paid if, as a result of the relevant accident or disease, there is a loss of physical or mental faculty to the extent that the resulting disablement is 1 per cent. or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The special medical questions which arise on a disablement claim are determined by medical boards or by medical appeal tribunals. The first question is whether the relevant accident has resulted in a loss of faculty; secondly, to what degree the amount of disablement is to be assesssed; thirdly, what period is to be taken into account in the assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until 1966, the relevant provisions of the Account were interpreted as meaning that in deciding the question of disablement benefit, the medical adjudicating authorities were not bound in any way by the findings of the lay statutory authorities when they awarded injury benefit in the preceding short-term benefit period. The medical authorities looked at the whole question afresh in order to decide the medical consequences of the accident. That was the position under the 1948 Act, but doubts arose as a result of the medical judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position changed as a result of the House of Lords judgment in the case of Dowling in 1966. That judgment was interpreted in the Department as meaning that the medical authorities were bound to accept that there had been an accident and some personal injury. It was not considered that it required the medical authorities to be bound by findings as to the nature or extent of the personal injury made by the lay statutory authorities. For instance, if it had apparently been accepted that a hernia was the personal injury caused by an accident, but the medical board found that there was not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0772">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>389</span>
in fact a hernia, but only strain of the groin, it would be open to the board to give its decision on the basis that the strain of groin was the relevant injury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, if it was felt that where there was more than one personal injury, it was open to the medical authorities to accept only one injury resulting from the accident if they so determined. In the view of the Department that the judgment would be conclusive as to the nature of the injury only in the very exceptional case where the accident and injury were regarded as inseparable, it was decided that the consequences would not be sufficiently serious to warrant any amendment of the Act. I think that it is for that reason that the previous Administration felt that the 1966 judgment did not call for clarification or amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This view of the effect of the Dowling judgment was challenged in the cases of Jones and Hudson, which eventually reached the House of Lords last year. In the course of the proceedings it was contended on behalf of the Secretary of State that the decision in Dowling's case was wrong and should be overruled. That contention was rejected by their Lordships who decided by a majority of four to three that the Dowling decision should not be overruled and by a majority of five to two, that the appeals should be allowed as indistinguishable from Dowling's case. The Dowling judgment had decided, so it was held, that the decision of the statutory authorities was final for all purposes relating to the relevant accident, namely, for disablement as well as for injury benefit purposes. The judgments in all three cases were majority judgments and their lordships foresaw that amending legislation might be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Committee should appreciate that. The right hon. Lady made the point that in effect the Department had been defeated by a judgment in the House of Lords. That is not the position. Those majority judgments were given in the House of Lords, and their lordships at the time the judgments were made foresaw the need for legislation to clarify the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Jones and Hudson judgments meant that the Department and the medical authorities could no longer act in accordance with the limited interpretation of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>390</span>
the Dowling judgment hitherto accepted, but that they must accept, for the purposes of disablement benefit, the medical conditions or condition found by the statutory authorities to have resulted from the relevant accident and to have caused incapacity for work. It is now apparent that in practice this may mean that almost any diagnosis on a medical certificate for which injury benefit is being paid has to be accepted as resulting from the accident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, medical men, including consultants, sitting on medical appeal tribunals may not be able to exercise their medical judgment, but will be bound by the earlier action of laymen who awarded injury benefit for which there are different criteria. This was one of the points mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford). Thus the position currently is that the judgment of the medical men is bound by decisions which have been made previously on matters concerning injury benefit for which there are different criteria than those applying to disablement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But, that lay opinion will have been given only in the light of the medical evidence which has been presented. A layman would not suddenly take it upon himself to diagnose a hiatus hernia.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that this is an involved argument. However, I hope shortly to prove to the satisfaction of the Committee that that is precisely what does not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the point concerning declarations, which has been mentioned by all hon. Members who have spoken. The effect of Clause 5 will be that a person may obtain a declaration that an accident was an industrial accident, provided that he shows first, that the accident arose out of or in the course of his employment; secondly, that his employment was insurable employment; and, thirdly, that the accident occurred in Great Britain. That is the position which obtained in the 1946 Act and in Section 48 of the subsequent consolidation Act. Therefore, it is not correct to adopt the interpretation that has been placed on these declarations, or indeed on finality of decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0773">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>391</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the right hon. Lady will allow me to complete my argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman moving on from the declaration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am moving to another leg of my argument. After I have completed my argument, I shall gladly deal with any further issues which may arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer now to the link between the disablement benefit and the injury benefit, a subject to which my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South has referred. Examining the effect of the injury or short-term benefit, shows that in the first place there is under the industrial injuries scheme a lead of injury benefit of about £2 over and above the equivalent benefit under the national insurance scheme. The injury benefit payment for a single person, uprated under the Bill, will be £9.50, whereas the sickness benefit under the national insurance scheme will be £6.75.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1971, injury benefit was paid in about 7,000 cases and the average duration of incapacity was 26 days. Only about one in five injury benefit claims proceeded to the disablement benefit stage. The injury benefit arrangements are quick, generously administered and the minimum questions are asked. Plainly, one does not wish to cause worry and concern to people who are already distressed as a result of an injury at work. It is for this reason that the procedure for the claiming of sickness or injury benefit is made as simple and as straightforward as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the procedure, the person who is injured will go to his doctor to obtain a note. On the reverse side of that note there will be a claim form which he will complete and send to his local social security office. The claim form will be for sickness benefit or injury benefit. The man himself will decide which he is claiming for. The doctor probably will not be concerned. There is no reason why he should know which benefit the man is claiming, because he is not equipped to advise him. The doctor is concerned only with deciding whether the man is incapable of working. If he decides that he is, the sickness note is signed and the claim entered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The form is sent to the local office where minimum checks are made, the main one being to ask the employer whether there was an accident at work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>392</span>
The local office is not concerned with the exact nature of the accident. At that point to obtain injury benefit it is necessary only to establish that there has been an accident at work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of this streamlined procedure, payments are usually made within a week or ten days. In the majority of cases there are no long-term effects. It is not necessary, therefore, for the determining authorities to pay regard to the long-term consequence of the decision itself, or of all the attendant findings of fact of the various associated matters involved in that decision. It would be necessary without the Clause. Insurance offices would need expert medical advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The point I am making here is that there is a distinction between the procedures which are involved for disablement benefit and those for injury benefit. In the majority of cases of injury benefit there are no long-term effects. There is therefore no necessity for the determining authority to pay regard to long-term consequences of the decisions, or of all the attendant findings of fact on the various associated matters involved in that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But this would be necessary if something along the lines of the Opposition's proposals were to be accepted. Insurance offices would then need expert medical advice to determine more accurately the conditions resulting from the accident and the possible long-term consequences. They would also have to ask many more questions than they now do about dependants who are being claimed for. There would be an inevitable repercussion on the short-term injury benefit arrangements if the Opposition's proposal were accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interests of quick, sympathetic administration, which are the hallmarks of injury benefit arrangements at present, would no longer obtain, as considerable tightening-up would be necessary because of the direct repercussions that the decisions made by lay insurance officers in the social security office would have in the event of subsequent claims for disablement benefit and another series of judgments having to be made which would already be channelled into a course which was made previously by laymen. For that reason, the effect of the Oppo-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>393</span>
sition's proposal, would inevitably be to the detriment of those in receipt of injury benefit, who form the vast majority of beneficiaries under the industrial injuries scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend's argument, but I think that his basic premise is wrong. Unless the whole system of medical certification has changed in the past few years since I deserted my 3,500 National Health Service patients for a rather less lucrative but more "comfy" life, the system was that whenever patients came to one needing a certification of incapacity for work, whether due to illness or injury, there was on the initial form a line on which the diagnosis was placed. Even in my lowly status in medicine I considered that that was not entirely the diagnosis of a layman. Later, if this was covered by an entry in an injury book, or if there was a question of injury, reference was made to that initial diagnosis. If the initial diagnosis referred to an industrial disease, again reference was made to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is absolutely no reason why payment should not be made on the incapacity to work, whatever the cause may later prove to be. I see no reason why this initial, kindly payment, as my hon. Friend out it, should be withheld because there is a question of the injury being due directly or indirectly to work. What matters is the diagnosis on the initial form and the opinion of the doctor that the patient is unfit to work. I think that the whole of the rest of the argument falls on that completely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I think that my hon. Friend is wrong on two counts. First, all that the doctor has to say is that the person is incapable of work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has to give a diagnosis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On many occasions, although not on every occasion, he will say what he thinks is the cause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The form must have been changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He will say what he thinks the cause of the trouble is—backache, hernia, or whatever it is—but he is not concerned with the benefit that the person may then claim. That is on the other side of the form. The doctor is not concerned
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>394</span>
with that. He will not know whether the individual is going to apply for sickness benefit or injury benefit. That is the first point. I think that my hon. Friend will agree from his experience that that is the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree at all. None of the medical certificates would be accepted if one failed to fill in the line asking for the diagnosis. It is quite true to say that one writes down "hernia" or "backache" or whatever, but if one wrote nothing at all and merely said that the man was unfit for work, it would not be accepted by the local office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has misunderstood. I am saying that the doctor is not concerned with the benefit for which the individual whom he has certified unfit for work is applying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is not concerned with that at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The person concerned then signs the form and applies either for injury benefit or for sickness benefit. At that point the doctor is not concerned with what benefit he applies for. Is my hon. Friend with me?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. At this stage that is so, but there will be reference to the initial certificate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Right. That is the position. The lay authorities within the local social security office then award injury benefit, if the person is entitled to it, having satisfied themselves that he is entitled to it. One of the procedures is that they will satisfy themselves by contact with the employer that the accident took place at work. However, they are not concerned with the nature of the accident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of what the Opposition propose is that acceptance by the lay authorities in local social security offices of entitlement to injury benefit binds the later medical authorities in the event of the person's trouble not clearing up and his eventually applying for a long-term disablement benefit. Therefore, in order to protect the arrangements within the scheme it would be necessary to have much tighter procedures concerning the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0775">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>395</span>
receipt of injury benefit than we have now. It will be against the interests of the much larger number of people who apply for injury benefit if we tighten up the procedures and ask many more questions than we do now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The great strength of the procedures for injury benefit is they are quick, that payment is soon made—usually within a week or 10 days. It would be impossible to preserve the advantages contained in the system if decisions made on that basis were to influence and bind the decisions made by medical authorities at a later stage if the person concerned applied for disablement benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made enormous play of the point that, if industrial injury benefit findings are to be binding, one would have to be more elaborate in one's criteria for giving it. That is the main point of his argument so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. Gentleman not aware that his argument does not affect any one of the cases that I have raised this morning? How does he use that argument to justify the case that I raised on death benefit arising out of a hernia, where disablement benefit had been allowed? It was the disablement benefit stage that had been passed. Yet although disablement benefit had been granted, the widow had to reopen the whole case for the sake of death benefit. Nothing that the hon. Gentleman has said deals with that situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Lady, very understandably, has cited some of the most difficult cases. They were difficult under the 1948 arrangements, and they will be no less difficult under the restored arrangements than they are at present. I accept with regard to death benefit that there is an issue to be dealt with. The difficulties that arise because of complex medical questions, on which there will inevitably be differences of view among medical practitioners, are inherent in trying to assess to what extent, or whether, a condition is the result of an accident at work. That is there in the industrial injuries scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that, if the cause of an accident has been established for disablement benefit purposes, it ought to remain valid
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>396</span>
for the rest of any claims, including death benefit? That is the point which he has to answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing in the Clause alters that position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause is clarifying the law, which is not clarified at present. The right hon. Lady was speaking about the inevitable problems which arise in difficult cases in the administration of a scheme of this kind, involving medical judgments. There is not an exact science which can be applied to these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marsden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I put it concisely? Once it is established that there has been an accident and that it was an industrial accident, is that declaration final? Does it bind subsequent claims and tribunals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is not altered. The Clause is clarifying the law and restoring the position as it has existed since 1948 and as it has worked, reasonably effectively, since then. Of course, there have been difficulties and hard cases but, until the Dowling judgment in 1966, the system worked on the whole reasonably satisfactorily, although there were, inevitably, hard cases involved in the administration of the arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing sinister in what the Government are proposing. I believe that the Opposition, had they been in Government, would have made the same decision. It is necessary to restore the position as it was thought to have existed since 1948. This is a complicated technical matter, and I shall study carefully all the speeches which have been made and the detailed points put to me from both sides of the Committee. I accept that there was not much time on Second Reading to discuss the matter. There are complicated legal questions involved, and we are anxious to get the law right. We are anxious that the scheme shall be clear to all concerned and that the benefit of the doubt shall be exercised in the interests of the claimant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. O'Malley) asked why it was necessary to proceed so quickly. It was necessary to proceed at the first opportunity because the position is unsatisfactory, unclear and likely to give rise to a good deal of litigation. This was the first suitable oppor-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0776">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>397</span>
tunity which arose, following the judgment, for us to legislate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. A. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we accept what my hon. Friend says, that there is nothing sinister in the Government's intention. But hon. Members opposite have put a fairly important point • Clause 5, a somewhat obscure and unrelated Clause. Accepting that it was necessary to do it as soon as possible, was there any reason for putting it in as a Clause in a Bill of this sort rather than, in the light of its possible importance, bring in a separate short Measure to amend the law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is familiar with the pressures of the parliamentary timetable. The Bill deals with both national insurance and industrial injuries. It provides for an increase of benefits under the industrial injuries scheme. It is making some improvement; it is not merely a straight uprating. It seemed natural and appropriate, therefore, that this provision should be included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have convinced the Committee that it is necessary to clarify the law. Whatever the right hon. Lady may say about the merits of the case, she did concede that. This is the first opportunity. It is not in anyone's interests that the law should remain obscure and that the possibility of litigation and the time which it takes should continue to hang over people's heads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the Committee the firm undertaking that I shall study with care, with the help of my advisers, the points which have been made today. Equally, I hope that the Committee will accept the need for clarification and that the Clause is the most effective way to achieve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, the law has to be clarified. But it would be a tragedy if we clarified it in the wrong way. The Under-Secretary's comments this morning prove that it is necessary for there to be further discussion on Report. I do not seek to make party-political points. After all, both Governments have been involved in this type of administration. However, it was clear from the hon. Gentleman's reply this morning that he is in difficulty, and it will be necessary
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>398</span>
for me to analyse his reply at our next Sitting. I shall try not to do so at length, but some of his arguments could be torn to shreds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, the hon. Gentleman was reading a legal brief. I sympathise with him. It happened to me when I was a Minister. One hopes that it will be "all right on the night," but as one is reading it, while the Committee listens rather sceptically, one suddenly thinks, "I don't think much of my own case". A good Minister will then go back to his Department and say, "Lads, I don't like this."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without being offensive to civil servants, I think that over the years the bureaucrats have run the administration of these procedures behind the backs of Ministers in respect of personal applications which Ministers often do not take up. Their experts have said, "Minister, if this ruling goes through, we shall be in trouble. We must appeal, or take it to the House of Lords." The Minister and the politicians have not taken on board the human significance of what we have discussed this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is in a morass of argument. He said, for example, that the Government were merely restoring the position to what it was originally believed to be. I have gone back as far as possible into the parliamentary history of these discussions. Discussion of the industrial injury scheme was initiated during the war. Whether one refers to Cmnd. 6551 of September, 1944, or to the Explanatory Memorandum of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Bill of June, 1945, one finds the same theme running through them all from the outset, namely, the need for finality of decisions when the proper procedure has been followed in each case. Indeed, the Explanatory Memorandum to the 1945 Bill draws the clear distinction between the determination of claims—the point of entitlement—and states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Appeals will lie from the decision of the local Tribunal to an Industrial Injuries Commissioner whose decision will be final."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
