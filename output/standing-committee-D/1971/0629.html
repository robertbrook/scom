	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sir Stephen, I support the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell). We all appreciate his well known concern for elderly people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the Amendment because it repeats the matter my hon. Friend raised in his Ten-Minute Bill on 11th April, 1972. The surprising thing about pension provisions, certainly for old-age pensioners, is that over the last quarter of a century, during which time old-age pensioners have lived through periods of cuts in public expenditure and are now living in a period of increasing public expenditure with massive tax concessions, the basic rate for the single old-age pensioner has remained at about 20 per cent. of average earnings, and for married couples at 30 per cent. Throughout the whole of that period, despite minor ups and downs in the percentage figure, that is where the rates have stuck. Basically, old-age pensioners have not shared in the rising prosperity which inevitably takes place, irrespective of which party is in power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that we have condemned our old-age pensioner colleagues to stick at that rate is an indictment of the pension system. Events have outgrown the Jim Griffiths Bill. It is certainly an indictment of us as legislators that we have failed to improve the status of the old-age pensioner. From the point of view of enlightened self-interest as legislators we ought</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PROVISIONS TO BE SUBSTITUTED IN SCHEDULE 3 TO NATIONAL INSURANCE ACT 1965</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment No. 20 proposed</i>—(	<i>27th June</i>)—in page 11, column 2, to leave out line 36 and insert the words:</p>
	<p>to have done more. It must be the ambition of all of us to become old-age pensioners. The alternative is rather more frightening and worse than the possibility of becoming an old-age pensioner.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend was justified last week in drawing our attention very forcibly to the neglect of old-age pensioners. He raised two matters. He drew our attention to the gap between the living standards of the old-age pensioner, compared with the rest of society. He referred us especially to the large number of old-age pensioners who have to exist without any occupational pension; and to those who have occupational pensions, which are sometimes not worth the paper on which they are written.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend first focussed our attention on the gap and then, quite rightly, drew our attention to his belief, and that shared by a good many others, that this gap can be effectively narrowed only when pensions are related to earnings. He said that it was not sufficient to relate pensions upratings to rising prices, that if old-age pensioners were to get a fair deal their pensions should be related to average earnings, and that is what his Amendment seeks to do. He went on to stress that as long as the gap existed, it showed the comparative poverty of our old-age pensioners against the rest of society. As long as the gap existed, he said, it meant an inevitable drop in the living standards of old-age pensioners—men retiring at 65 and women at 60.</p>
	<p>The additional tragedy is that the longer
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0711">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>275</span>
a person lives beyond retirement, the greater the fall in his living standards, unless the pension is assessed at 20 or 30 per cent. of average earnings, because there is a need to replace household furnishings and so on after five or ten years. Consequently, the longer old-age pensioners live after retirement, the greater becomes the drop in their living standards. Both major parties are on record as being committed to the idea of some form of earnings-related pension, though I suspect that when the Government ultimately present their Bill, if they remain in office long enough to do so, the comparison between it and the so-called Crossman scheme will be as chalk to cheese.</p>
	<p>When the Labour Party was in office, the Bill we put forward had completed its Committee stage before the General Election. Had that Bill been implemented, by now earnings-related benefits would be building up to help our old-age pensioners. The Government White Paper setting out their intentions explains a form of earnings-related benefit. It is interesting to note how long it is taking for that Bill to see the light of day. I recall the present Secretary of State, then in opposition, assuring us in February, 1970, that his party had been working at a pension scheme for years and that it was ready for publication. That was two years ago, and we are still waiting for the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What my hon. Friend has said is very odd. The Under-Secretary is also on record as saying that the Conservative Party had not been able to prepare a pension scheme while in opposition, because as the Opposition it could not do so. There appears to be some discrepancy in the two statements which no doubt the Under-Secretary will clear up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Mr. Paul Dean)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ought not to rise to this bait, because the Bill is not yet even published, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will want to remind the Committee that it took many years for the Labour Party to produce its Bill. We produced our White Paper last September, which is a good deal better than the Labour Party achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
private exchange. Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. O'Malley) because I did not hear a word of it, which shows that one should not sit behind the speaker if one wants to hear him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not quote the whole of the Under-Secretary's speech, but we were told while he was in opposition that the Conservative Party had laboured over its Bill for months and years. If that is so, old-age pensioners have the right to expect the publication of a Bill much earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The criticism levelled at the Crossman Scheme, as at most schemes, is that it tended to be long term and to deal mainly with future pensioners while ignoring the present generation of old-age pensioners. People asked what the Government were proposing to do for the existing generation of old-age pensioners. The Under-Secretary and the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Mr. Fortescue), who is now silent because of his official position, used to chide us by saying that the Cross-man scheme did nothing for old-age pensioners. But it contained a provision for earnings-related benefit which would have been of help to existing old-age pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who paid any attention to that scheme will recall that Clause 36 set out to do two things. It related pension upratings to the general level of prices, and made provision for pension upratings to be related in particular to the state of the national economy and any rise in the general level of earnings and standard of living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that that was not obligatory, but at least it indicated that at that stage the then Secretary of State would have power to uprate pensions to restore purchasing power. He was also to be given additional power to enable him to make provision for old-age pensioners to share in the rising living standards of the community in general. Something like that provision in the Crossman scheme could have been slotted into the present Bill. Had that been done, it is possible that my hon. Friend the Member for Southall would not have moved Amendment No. 20.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sydney Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I read the newspapers prior to the last Budget, I thought that the Government were about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0712">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
to do something on these lines, and I imagine that many other people did, or there would not have been rumours in the Press. Alas, the situation has remained almost static.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reading newspapers these days must cause a great deal of concern, including concern about pension provisions. I seek to prove that my hon. Friend's Amendment is necessary if we are to give pensioners a fair deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment deals in percentages, which can be confusing, especially when one sees the percentages decreasing in the first part of the Amendment. I have tried to convert the percentages into money terms. The aim is to show how, over a four-year period, existing pensions could be directly related to average earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In year one of the operation suggested in the Amendment, the single old-age pension would rise to £8.06 and for a married couple to £13.95. In year two, the figures would be £8.78 and £14.46; in year three, the single pension would become £9.51 and that for a married couple £14.99. Finally, the single pension would be £10.33 and the married couple would receive £15.50. That would mean that at the end of the operating period the single pensioner would receive a pension which would be 33⅓ per cent. of average earnings, and the pension for a married couple would be 50 per cent. of average earnings. My figures may be a penny or so out one way or the other, but basically the arithmetic is sound. The aim of the Amendment is reasonable. It is not asking too much of a civilised society to make that scale of provision for old-age pensioners. It is a desirable aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of cost will undoubtedly arise. My hon. Friend made it clear that costs of the order suggested in his Amendment could not and should not be shirked by society if a fair deal was to be given to pensioners. The cost could be met by using the Trade Union Congress formula whereby nineteen-twentieths of the upratings would be met by Exchequer and employer contributions, leaving one-twentieth to be met by increases in graduated contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment has the support of Opposition Members and the hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) is also in
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
some sympathy with this type of Amendment, for on 20th June, 1972, he used these words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am sure that my hon. Friends on the back benches will support me in asking the Under-Secretary to give an undertaking that he will give serious consideration"—</p></blockquote>
whatever that may mean—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to giving such an increase, which will mean a genuine rise in the standard of living over and above that which takes inflation into account."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D</i>, 20th June, 1972; 	<i>c.</i> 161.]</p></blockquote>
This is what my hon. Friend is doing. Over a period of years, he wants to give a genuine rise in the standard of living of old-age pensioners, taking inflation fully into account and relating pensions to the earnings of the rest of the community. I am pleased to support my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell) referred to his Ten-Minute Bill and said that the Amendment was modest. In due course I shall remind him what the cost would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment would set the single person's pension at 26 per cent., and the pension of a married couple at 45 per cent., of average earnings in October next and raise them by stages over the subsequent three years to 33⅓ per cent. and 50 per cent. respectively. Based on the average earnings at October 1971 of about £31, the effect of the Amendment would be, in round terms, to raise the single rate of retirement pension in October 1972 to £8, and the married rate to £14. Eventually, the rates would be raised on the basis of current earnings to around £10 for a single person and £15.50 for a married couple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over and above the £500 million or so in the Bill and other consequential changes, in the first year the additional cost for retirement pensions would be about £550 million per year, rising eventually to £1,250 million. That is the additional cost that the Amendment would impose. To meet that cost by the existing method would mean an immediate increase in contributions at the top end, for the £48 per week man and his employer, of 55p per week, rising eventually to £1.25. That is the extent of the additional cost over and above the increases involved in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary will recall that in the speech to which he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0713">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>279</span>
referred I talk about offsetting costs: I do not spell them out. But there would be certain quite substantial offsetting costs, although probably difficult to calculate, in terms of civil servants' time in sorting out supplementary benefits and so on, due to the simplicity of the proposals in the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has raised the point, I will turn at once to the effect upon supplementary benefits, and what he described as the gap, which is roughly £2, between the National Insurance retirement pension and the average rate for people on supplementary benefit, taking into account the scale rate and the addition for rent and rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman seemed to create the impression that if his Amendment or a similar Amendment to raise the National Insurance pension were adopted, the number of people on supplementary benefit would decline, and that therefore the administrative process of assessing their needs would also decline. With respect, that would not be so unless he intended to hold down the rates of supplementary benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that if he were to jack up the retirement pension, and thus assist those not on supplementary benefit, he would equally wish to jack up the rate of supplementary benefit in order to help those receiving supplementary benefit on top of the National Insurance pension. If he did not do that, those who are now on supplementary benefit would get the proposed higher level of retirement pension—that would be taken into account in assessing their needs—and their supplementary benefit would drop by the same amount as the increase in their national insurance retirement pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman would wish to do that. If he did, only those above the supplementary benefit level would gain. The higher paid would have the greatest increase and the greatest improvement in their standard of living, and the lower paid would be kept down. The hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. O'Malley) nods. He understands this, and I think that he would accept the point. I do not accept, therefore, that the effect of the hon. Gentleman's proposal would be to take people off supplementary benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may put the
	<span class='label label-info column'>280</span>
record straight. The hon. Gentleman referred to the fact that I nodded my head. The nod was an indication that I understood, as the whole Committee understands, that there is a problem. Any Government introducing a National Insurance pension scheme setting a far higher level than the current scheme will be faced with the dilemma of what to do about the level of supplementary benefits. It is not a simple question. Many members of the Committee, of every party, are of the view that in modifying existing pension schemes or introducing new ones we should be seeking to reduce the numbers on supplementary benefit, and there is a dilemma implicit in uprating the National Insurance pension by any substantial amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman agrees. There is a dilemma. Under the existing arrangements there is no way of getting people off supplementary benefit without holding down the level of supplementary benefit and, therefore, holding down the assistance which we all wish to give to those who are dependent on supplementary benefit. That is the position. The hon. Gentleman would not find that by jacking up the National Insurance pension he would be able to reduce the number of people on supplementary benefit unless he were prepared to pay the price—which I am sure he would not be. That is the dilemma. I am not making a party political point. It has happened under all Governments, and no Governments have been prepared to pay the price involved, which would mean holding down the standards of living to those who most need help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax credit system holds out real hope for the future. I shall not expand on that at the moment since the Committee will wish to study the Green Paper, not yet published, and not want to take my word for it. The tax credit proposals provide the most hopeful way of dealing with the dilemma which we inevitably face under the present arrangements. These proposals will be published in discussion form, in a Green Paper, fairly soon, and all hon. Members and people outside will be able to comment on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should mention another aspect while dealing with supplementary benefit. Those who are above supplementary benefit are so for a number of reasons—usually
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0714">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>281</span>
because they have savings of one form or another. It is important to bear in mind that a growing number of people have occupational pensions over and above the basic National Insurance pensions. I am not saying that everybody has such a pension, they do not, but as the years go by a growing number of people have, and it is right to take that factor into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I remind the Committee of the latest figures. In 1956, just over one million people were in receipt of occupational pensions, and the latest figures show over two million in receipt of occupational pensions. The latest figures of amounts, taken from the Family Expenditure Survey of 1970, showed the average pension payment as over £6 a week, with the median pension payment at over £4 a week. They are considerable figures, remembering that the State retirement pension at the moment is £6 for a single person. I am not suggesting that there are no pensions which are lower than that—there are. The figures show that we are making progress in a second pension for a growing number of people over and above the basic pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one other figure which illustrates my point. The outgo of occupational pension schemes in 1963 was something over £600 million. It is now over £1,000 million. That again shows progress and development in that field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the point made by the hon. Gentleman, which was also mentioned by the hon. Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones), about Exchequer contributions. He said that if the Exchequer contribution were increased, it would be easier to meet the additional costs involved. The present Exchequer contribution is about 18 per cent., the level fixed by the previous Administration. They thought that to be the appropriate division at that time between what should be paid by the taxpayer and what should be paid by the contributor on his insurance contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whichever way one does it, one cannot get away from the fact that the substantial sums required for retirement pensions have to be found by the present working generation. The scheme is, and always has been, a cross-subsidy between generations. What is paid in contributions today by the working population is paid
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
out tomorrow in pensions and other benefits. However one raises it, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) said in an earlier debate, it comes out of the same pocket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no party political controversy about it, but we have recognised that one of the weaknesses of the present system of contributions is that it is regressive. A flat-rate contribution inevitably bears harder on the lower paid than on the higher paid, and involves a higher proportion of the wage payment of the lower paid, which is why we are moving over to the system of earnings-related contributions. Each individual, over and above a floor, will pay the same percentage of his earnings within the floor and the ceiling laid down, and that will go a long way to deal with the criticisms which have rightly been levelled against the existing system. We are now as far as we can go along the road to earnings-related contributions before moving over to them fully in a few years time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About half the money now raised is raised through earnings-related contributions. This year and last year no additional cost of contributions was put on the lower paid. Those earning £18 a week or less are to pay nothing more, and they paid nothing more last year. The whole of the increase is to be borne by those earning above that amount and by the employers—a slightly higher percentage of the cost is to be borne by employers this year than was the case under the previous methods of finance in last year's Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, however it is met, we come back to the basic fact that it has to be met by the working population, and that we have to strike a balance between what people can reasonably be expected to pay and the dangers that are involved in increasing contributions—the dangers involved in prices, and wage claims, and therefore the dreary round of inflation, the biggest enemy of all for those living on pensions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Marsden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what has been said, and I realise that a lot of things are interlinked. Would the Under-Secretary say something about the new tax credit system which is to come into being, since I am assuming that it will drastically reduce the numbers who now have to apply for supplementary benefit. Can we take it that over the years
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0715">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
it is the intention of the Government—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the hon. Gentleman not to persuade the Minister to wander up that path, interesting as I am sure it would be. It would not be appropriate to discuss future legislation which is not now before the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marsden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Sir Stephen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may say that, yes, the tax credit scheme will have the effect of taking off it a substantial number of people who are now dependent on supplementary benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked me why we should maintain the system of contributions which exists now. The main reason is that the contribution system has been felt over the years to be the most effective way of ensuring that people have a title to benefit. People who have paid contributions are entitled, as of right, to the receipt of the benefits which follow from those contributions. It may be said that as we move increasingly towards an earnings related contribution the concept becomes a little thinner, but it is still there. I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that it is a valuable concept, and one which we ought to preserve in insurance arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not say that the National Insurance Scheme is the same as life assurance, or an occupational pension scheme, but it is a contributory scheme, and the concept of benefit as of right in return for contributions is one which I suggest is valuable and worth maintaining.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not my hon. Friend agree that a great deal of the reluctance on the part of the working population to see the contribution increased is that there is misunderstanding as to what kind of contribution it is. It is not a contribution: it is purchasing a ticket for the right to receive a pension. However, if it is pay-as-you-go, as the hon. Gentleman suggested earlier, would not my hon. Friend agree that a great deal more needs to be put across to the working population?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. It is for that reason that we call a spade a spade in the White Paper "Strategy for Pensions". We set out quite
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
clearly that this is a cross-subsidy between the generations, and that the contribution is used straight away to pay for existing pensions. Would not my hon. Friend agree that that has helped to bring out into the open what the basic scheme is by the way in which it is described in the White Paper?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next matter that was raised by the hon. Member for Southall and also by the hon. Member for Rhondda, West was that we have not managed substantially to increase the relationship between average earnings and pensions. The hon. Member for Rhondda, West said that it has hovered around one-fifth for a single person and slightly over 30 per cent. for a married couple, and that it has not moved very much one way or the other. That is true. I do not intend to dispute that. I appreciate that the hon. Gentlemen are not making party political points. This has been the situation under all Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has to bear in mind that although that may be the position, the growth in the number of pensioners is another factor which we have to take into account. At present we have 7½ million pensioners. The ratio of pensioners to workers will continue to grow until the 1980s, when we reach a peak. Therefore, there will be fewer workers available to support a growing number of pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may illustrate that by looking at the gross national product. The percentage of the GNP which goes in social security benefits has been increasing over the years. In 1950 the percentage was 5.22. By 1970 it had risen to 8.64 per cent. This is absolutely right, and is inevitable. It reflects the growing percentage of pensioners in our population. It also reflects that we are, because of this, devoting a higher proportion of our national resources to social security benefits. The figures I have given relate to the cash benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, over the years, the amount spent on health and welfare services for the elderly must also continue to grow. This is an inevitable and proper feature in view of the increase in the number of old people in the population. It is one of the factors we have to take into account when assessing how much we can reasonably expect the existing working population to contribute towards the services available for elderly people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point that we have an increasing number of old-age pensioners, which makes it more difficult to get extra payments made by the declining numbers in the work force. Is not that a further argument for the 18 per cent. of Exchequer contribution to be increased?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, there is no magic in 18 per cent. What I am saying is that however one decides to meet the cost, it has to be met by the working generation—whether it is met through taxation, contributions or through a change in the combination of both. Those are the factors which I suggest to the Committee are important in considering the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides a substantial increase in the benefits; it provides improvements in a number of critical areas. These increases will provide a real improvement in the benefits when they come into operation in October. There is a substantial cost which has to be borne by the contributor and the taxpayer in order to support these benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of all the circumstances we have the balance about right. There is a firm commitment on the part of the Government to ensure, in what are now annual reviews, that the pension will be restored to its value at least in each uprating. Over and above that, each year the Government will decide how much more can be done. It is much better for the decision over and above price protection to be made each year, in the light of economic and social circumstances and priorities, rather than for the Government of the day to be committed. The Amendment would commit them without knowledge of the precise circumstances at that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Tom Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for speaking after his reply. He raised one or two points that we might look at more closely. We all agree with the spirit of the Amendment. It raises various technical questions which I, who have never been able to calculate my own income tax, certainly would not suggest should necessarily be followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been too many statistics in this debate and not enough people. The basic truth of the matter is that if one visits people's houses day after day—as I
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
did before I came here—one finds that the standard of living of old-age pensioners is falling. It has been falling throughout all the Governments during whose terms of office I have practised medicine. The reason is that we do not understand the social changes which have occurred in the houses of the elderly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps a greater social change is the fact that the oldest generation, which is now sometimes three generations above the youngest generation, no longer live in their homes with the rest of the family. They are living by themselves, separated from their families who live not only in other parts of the country but in other parts of the world. Those old people are left alone and isolated. I believe this to be important when we discuss contributions, because if an older member lives with the family the contribution made to that person should be a great deal more than 55p or £1.25 a week. Those were the figures suggested by the hon. Member for Southall. It would cost many pounds a week to keep that person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we shift from individual responsibility, when families once looked after their own aged, towards community responsibility, the community must take up social service. We must begin to realise that the community will have to pay an ever larger slice of the wage packet to look after the aged. The families will not be able to do it. It is a matter not of selfishness, but of economics. It is not a matter of being cruel, unkind or inconsiderate. It is often a matter of moving. A family may live in Cornwall and the old parents may still live in their old mining village or in the North-East. The family is not there to give payment in kind, let alone in comfort, as would have been done in previous generations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have seen this happening in my own practice. What we must drive home to the working generations is that they owe this to the older generation. I believe that the younger members of the working generation would willingly accept the burden of, say, the 55p or £1.25 a week. I am sure that they would consider that a trivial sum to pay to maintain their grandparents in the way in which they are entitled. It is a benefit as of right. All old people should have as of right a much higher standard of living than they have at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Year by year more old people are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0717">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>287</span>
living on pensions and not on what their families are providing. If families do not make such provision personally—there has been much criticism about this issue—they must provide it from the community chest to which every family can contribute regardless of how many aged relatives they have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am therefore sympathetic towards the hon. Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell). I accept the figures and technical imperfections in his Amendment, but I hope that the Department will begin to realise that it must take into account the changes in social custom and social 	<i>mores.</i> We cannot go on talking about what the pension will bring in terms of what it brought in 1955. The social pattern is different. We must compensate for this change, and we must see that the older people start to benefit from the growth in productivity of the world as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what my hon. Friend said, and I accept a good deal of his argument. Would not he agree that it applies as much, if not more, in the realm of community services which are being rapidly expanded by the Government and local authorities, as it does to pensions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly I accept that. However, I feel that there is a great deal of misapprehension about community services. They are being expanded. The present Government have done as much as if not more than anyone else to expand them. I pay tribute to what my hon. Friend and his colleagues in the Department have done. But as yet what has been done has not made a great deal of impact on pensioners. It is not yet the answer. It is not yet an answer against increasing pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the whole, the older people, living in their houses for as long as they can, want to have the money to spend as they wish. They would rather have that than the meals-on-wheels coming round from the field kitchen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or cheap buses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or cheap buses. We must preserve their independence for as long as we can. We cannot shelter behind such services. We must accept the fact that we have an increasingly aged population. There will be increasing expense, and we must stomach it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>288</span>
Families go through tight periods financially—when the breadwinner is elected to Parliament that is a tight phase financially—but they come out of it sooner or later. We have this population bulge in the elderly: sooner or later we shall come out of it, but while that bulge exists there is no reason why we should leave them in discomfort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell). His Amendment spotlights the fact that over many years there has been no improvement—in some years actual deterioration—in the comparative incomes of those who comprise the working population on the one hand and the retirement pensioners on the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that as long ago as 1948, when the National Insurance Scheme was started by a Labour Administration, at a time when the country was virtually bankrupt as a result of the damage and destruction and the economic and financial cost of a world war, the pension for a married couple, expressed as a percentage of average earnings at that time, was 30.5 per cent. On the last figures that I have, those for 1971, the figure was 31.4 per cent.—about the same. I will return to the percentages as they operated in the years between 1948 and 1971.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking just at the figures for 1948 and 1971, it is clear that as a result of the policies of successive Governments of differing political persuasions the position of the retirement pensioner 	<i>vis-à-vis</i> the working population has not changed since 1948. The concept of annual reviews was introduced only very recently. As a result of a system in which, for example, during a period of Conservative Government there were three pensions increases in eight and a half years, not only have we not maintained this relationship, which remained static between 1948 and 1971, but in many years the relationship has deteriorated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary looked at some of these figures and said that he did not want to make any party political points. I have no such hesitation. The Under-Secretary himself has had no such hesitation in many debates on this subject in which he and I have taken part. The Committee should note that it has been during the years of Conservative Adminis-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0718">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>289</span>
tration that the relationship between the income of the family with national average earnings and the retired couple has reached its lowest points; for example, in 1954, in 1957, and again in 1960.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst as a result of the policies of successive Governments there has been no overall change between 1948 and 1971, nevertheless the worst years have been years of Conservative Government. The high point, when real improvement was being made, was in 1965, when a Labour Government had come to power, and still further improvement was made in 1967. But for the dangerous economic and financial situation in which the incoming Labour Administration found itself as a result of the policies of a Conservative Government, still further progress might have been made and we should not have been in this very unsatisfactory position today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After two years of Conservative Government, the whole prospect of future improvement is already being undermined once again by Conservative policies. We have seen this in the last week with the introduction of the floating pound which, to the dismay of everyone in the country, is manifestly refusing to float. Indeed, on the markets yesterday it was sinking quite considerably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marsden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very interesting to have all these statistics again, and one sees the point, but would my hon. Friend be prepared to put it like this? The pensioner of 1972 is not better housed, better fed, better clothed or better off in any material sense than the pensioner of 1948. Is that what he is saying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am saying is closely related to what the hon. Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford) has said. One has to take into account not only the financial resources of the family but also the changed social structure, so that in comparative terms pensioners must be counted as a deprived section of the population even though they constitute a considerable proportion of that population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made no progress over many years. My hon. Friend's Amendment is designed to improve the condition and financial position of the retirement pensioner—both the single person and married couple—compared with that of a working family with an income at national average earnings level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
The Under-Secretary once again introduced the subject of occupational pensions, and once again we must reply that there are substantial numbers of retirement pensioners drawing occupational pensions. Some of those occupational pensions provide good cover not only for the husband but for his dependants also. On the other hand many do not, and take people only a fraction above supplementary benefit levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of the statistics quoted by the Under-Secretary, present trends indicate that by the end of the twentieth century one-third of all retirement households will still be without an occupational pension. We cannot therefore call in aid the existence of the occupational pensions movement; it is merely a welcome and useful addition. So long as large numbers of households throughout the remainder of the century will not receive occupational pensions, or if they do, such pensions will be small, they cannot be taken into account as a major factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless we make the kind of progress sought in the Amendment the deprivations referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Scotland (Mr. Marsden) will continue. He suggested it was not enough to treat the matter on a statistical basis. He is right. It needed to be pointed out, and that is the value of my hon. Friend's Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we should make progress in the way the Amendment directs. The present National Insurance pension is inadequate, even with supplementary benefits, and as a result a retirement couple have a frugal and meagre standard of living. Of over seven million retirement pensioners, about two million are dependent on supplementary benefit in order to live. And of elderly widows, almost one half have to rely on means-tested supplementary benefit. A few moments ago, the hon. Member for Norwich, South brought his professional experience to bear on the subject and told us that the retirement pensioner with no other income on top of supplementary benefit was living a deprived and unsatisfactory life in 1972.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During previous debates we heard a large number of quotations on the plight of the pensioners, and I shall not seek to discuss, quote or introduce any further individual examples. Help the Aged recently published a document called "Grannie come home", which we have all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0719">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
received. It is as good a document as any other to illustrate the plight in which many old people without relatives and without family find themselves. In the circumstances of absolute inadequacy which we all recognise, it is not only important, but in the interests of retirement pensioners vital that there should be the progress which my hon. Friend the Member for Southall envisages in his Amendment, and that the income of the retirement pensioner should move towards that of the working population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Merely to implement pension increases which deal with rising prices, even if they were to give complete inflation proofing, is in itself not enough. That will mean, as it has meant for many years in the past, that year after year the retirement household will fall steadily behind the financial resources, the total income and the total standards of the households containing workers. We must seek to achieve something far better than inflation proofing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote from 	<i>Pensioners Voice</i>, the official publication of the National Federation of Old Age Pensions Associations for June 1972. The National President of that organisation, T. E. Nuttall, and I believe that it is the Reverend T. E. Nuttall, although the paper does not say so, discussing the present rise, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is true that the rise was a fairly large one but it has to be looked at in the context of the correspondingly very high rise in the general cost of living over the two previous years:"</p></blockquote>
He went on to consider the relationship between men in industry, men at work, and retirement pensioners, and he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When we consider that in 1939 the pension was one-third of the average earnings in industry and on today's figures it is rather less than one-fifth, it must be obvious that rises in pension have not kept pace with rises in wages and salaries and that the living standards of the elderly have not been maintained."</p></blockquote>
On all the figures that we have, when we are making comparisons, as we are on the Amendment, what the Reverend Nuttall writes is absolutely true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing the Amendment against a background in which it is becoming increasingly frequent to hear of debates at trade union conferences, among professional bodies, in women's organisations, demanding earlier retirement. Any human being would want to achieve a position in which men and women may retire and use a number of years for leisure while still in
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
good health. We must all welcome the present trend to earlier retirement, but one factor has to be taken into account if we are to consider our views and the policies of the parties on earlier retirement, particularly compulsory early retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the age of retirement for men were to be brought down from 65 to 62, 60 or any other age, unless we radically amended the pension structure, we should be condemning large numbers of citizens to a severe drop in income years earlier than at present. Bearing in mind the nature of the present national insurance scheme and the fact that occupational pensions do not cover everybody, before we can have a realistic and useful policy on earlier retirement, we have to think hard about the level of the national insurance pension for those who will be taken into retirement. It is not helping a man to take him from the shop floor at 60, instead of 65, much as he might want to give up working, if he then finds that he is living a life severely restricted and curtailed as a result of a severe drop in income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary mentioned those retirement pensioners who receive supplementary benefit, and he pointed out that unless one were to raise the supplementary benefit levels at the same time, the Amendment could result in increases reaching those above supplementary benefit level, rather than those receiving supplementary benefit. We all recognise the difficulty and the dilemma and we must seek to establish a system by which the number of retirement pensioners who have to be dependent on means-tested benefits is reduced substantially. We have to make that a major object of policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Substantial numbers of retirement pensioners not receiving supplementary benefit should be receiving it, or, if they are not entitled to it, are disqualified from receiving it only because their income is marginally above the supplementary benefit level. I believe that if the level were to be increased by about £1, substantial additional numbers of retirement pensioners would be brought within the supplementary benefit system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, while I recognise the problems which the Under-Secretary discussed, I do not believe that he can use that as an argument against the Amendment. We recognise the dilemma, and we shall examine the Government's tax credit proposals to see whether they can be of any assistance in the coming years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A substantial part of the hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0720">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
Gentleman's argument was bound up with the cost of the Amendment. That is what the Under-Secretary said on earlier Amendment, and I do not intend to go over those arguments. It is perfectly clear that in a situation in which a Chancellor can introduce the kind of Budget introduced in April, this year, there is room to give more money to the old-age pensioner. The hon. Member for Norwich, South is absolutely right—there is no merit in ducking it. One has to go to public meetings at election times and on other occasions and say that pensioners are living on a pittance. One should say that there is only one source from which the money can come, and that is from the working population, through contributions and taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, having said that, one is left with a number of choices. For example, one has to get one's priorities right. One does not start by introducing a Budget which gives large sums of money to the better off, to people dabbling in share options. One's priorities should be for the poor rather than for the rich. Contributions should not be increased to the level the Under-Secretary suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Exchequer contribution has not always been 18 per cent. under successive Governments. In 1948–49 the total Exchequer payments, at a percentage of flat rate contributions, was 32.9 per cent. It dropped under a Conservative Government—this relates to something that I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool Scotland (Mr. Marsden) on a previous Amendment—from 32.9 per cent. to 14.5 per cent. in 1952–53, and that record was maintained right to the end of 1965. There is nothing sacred about the figure of 18 per cent. In the right kind of economic circumstances, one can amend not only the Exchequer supplement, but the total Exchequer payments, whether through deficit payments, flat rate contributions, or earnings-related contributions. Large sums of money could have been raised for pensions this year through the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member talked about the effect on contributions under the levels and structure of contributions dealt with in Clause 3. What would be the effect on contributions if the Exchequer contribution was raised substantially to, say, what it was in 1948–49, over 30 per cent., and the employer's contribution was raised on the lines that my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle)
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
mentioned last week? If instead of this almost indecipherable and incomprehensible system of flat-rate part earnings-related contributions, the whole lot were related, what would be the effect on employees' contributions? My guess would be that the figures would look very different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible to finance these matters even in the economic circumstances in which the Government have found themselves. Even though they are hellbent on destroying the whole basis of prosperity left to them in 1970 when they came into power, it is possible to do something for the pensioners this year. Because I approve of the general aims and principles of the Amendment, I will support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am not tied specifically either to the figures of my hon. Friend's formula, or the formula itself. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] The Under-Secretary laughs. He should compare the flat-rate benefits that his Government propose to pay out as a result of their White Paper with the benefits that would have been paid out under the Crossman scheme. For example, the man now on national average earnings would receive half-pay on retirement under the Crossman scheme. The man on less than average earnings would receive 60 per cent. of his earnings. So there is plenty of scope for the Labour Party to discuss the exact formula and method by which we must seek to achieve this aim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee may be pleased to know that it is not my intention to speak at great length. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will intervene to say that he has learned a lot from the debate and that the Government will have second thoughts about committing themselves, but, from what he said earlier, I do not think so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will agree, Sir Stephen, that we have probably had a more far-ranging, deeply penetrating debate on old-age pensioners than we have ever had before. The Opposition are totally unashamed about that. What my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. O'Malley) said is a matter of profound significance to the Labour movement, if not to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contribution of the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Norman Lamont), although typically Conservative,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0721">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>295</span>
subscribed to the view that there was a case for a change. Fundamentally, the Under-Secretary has not accepted that part of his argument. The hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen), although backing up his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, also subscribed, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones), to the view that a change along the lines of my Amendment was needed. Even if one is not committed to the whole principle of the three-year plan, one could certainly be committed to a 12-month plan or a two-year plan, because the Government have boasted of their change to calculating pension increases on a yearly basis. One imagines that even a Conservative Government would let some element of planning into their thoughts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contribution by the hon. Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford), although short, was outstanding. It was a grass roots contribution stemming from his own experience, and I was moved by what he had to say. I have already referred to the kind of community that I represent. One of the outstanding features of people who come from Asia is that they do not separate themselves from their old people. It is one of their features attractive to the rest of the indigenous working class. A noteworthy, creditable aspect of Asian family life is that no matter how old the grandfather is, he is still supreme and it is a duty on the rest of the family to see that he is cared for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we told the recent Commonwealth Party Association's visitors, we are concerned about the state of relationships between the indigenous population and immigrants. It is important that the Under-Secretary should understand the position, because our first priority is to know what people want to do. When we know that, we can apply our minds to statistics—the amount of money that has to be collected and so on. That, after all, is the duty of Government. The Under-Secretary's figures do not frighten me. I am sure the hon. Member for Norwich, South will agree that not least of the expenses that had to be met by the previous generation, one which we have to take into account when assessing what should go into their pockets now, was doctors' bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has done less than justice to the argument. He will have to rethink his position if what he says is to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
meaningful. He has seized hold of what he thought was a weakness in my Ten-Minute-Rule Bill by suggesting that I was trying to hold down supplementary benefits. Upgrading the basis of the national insurance pension will naturally affect supplementary benefits—like the "Irishman's rise," when the pension is increased just a little, a whole range of people drawing supplementary benefit have their benefits cut. But the terms I propose would not have such a profound effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unworthy of the Under-Secretary, unless he is hooked and hoisted on the Tory petard, to try to score political points in a debate of this nature. Although he is not able to go into more detail about tax reforms, the fact that he has introduced the subject is an indication that the Government has in mind such a way of holding down supplementary benefit entitlements, unless they propose to redraw the level of subsistence at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wells supported the Under-Secretary when he said that they had to make working people understand that it was only a ticket they were purchasing. A great number of working-class people have been involved in a taxation net out of all proportion to their incomes. As inflation has increased, it has brought them into the taxation net. Some Budgets had dropped them out; inflation has dropped them in again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national insurance pension is an insurance entitlement, whether people have earned it by their contributions and the sweat of their brows, or whether by the employer's contribution resulting from employing the sweat of the worker's brow, or whether the employer has paid taxation as a result of that, or the worker has paid taxation, or whether both together have paid taxation in order to make a contribution to the Exchequer—and the entitlement is enshrined in the whole fabric of the national insurance scheme as we have known it over the years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

has said, because I am sure that he is sincere in his belief—holds a Conservative view. I am a Socialist and what is more I bring to this House a background of teaching and being involved in the trade union movement. Indeed I was so involved for over 12 years and I can assure the Committee that that is not the attitude of the workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Intelligent shop stewards in industry understand what is happening. They want not inflationary wage increases, but real increases. In the climate of their society, they believe in keeping their end up. They might become excessive in their demands on occasions, as are other people, such as speculators and those who live on unearned income or distribute company profits. But that is the kind of society in which they live. They have no illusions on this matter and they have not learned any compassion in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Norwich, South denied this. He said people wanted to put matters right. If he is correct, the hon. Member for Wells cannot be. I do not think that either of them is. It is a question of leadership. Leadership is of profound importance and in this respect it is Government leadership that is of profound importance.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole Committee will agree that it is a very important Clause, because it does two things. First, it changes the eligibility rules for the attendance allowance. Secondly, it provides for the phasing-in of the payments that will result from the change in the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I must say how scandalous we think it is that the Government should have drawn up the Money Resolution so cunningly and so restrictively as to prevent our effectively influencing these changes in policy. They are detailed. I think the hon. Gentleman will agree that they are a little obscure and difficult to understand in some of their aspects and details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading we had no opportunity to examine them, particularly the proposals for phasing-in. The hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Norman Lamont) may be interested in this, as he gave us a lecture on Tuesday on what Committee stages ought to be about. He said that the Committee stage was for dealing with the "nuts and bolts." We agree. Yet his own Government have produced a Money Resolution which compels us to accept the figures of £5.40 for the higher rate of attendance allowance and £3.60 for the lower rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[Mr. MADEL in the Chair.]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we have been inhibited in putting forward the kind of Amendments on amount that we were able to move in our debates on Schedule 1. Schedule 1 and the Amendments to it, on which we spent so much time, come within the ambit of the National Insurance Fund. But the attendance allowance is in a special category and payments for it fall upon the Consolidated Fund. The Committee's freedom to discuss the nuts and bolts therefore depends entirely upon the latitude allowed by the Government's Money Resolution. They have drawn it so precisely that our Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 to increase the amounts of attendance allowance to £6.40 at the higher rate and £4.80 at the
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
lower rate have had to be ruled out of order. That is a rather questionable practice on the part of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It also prevents our altering the qualifications for eligibility. It prevents our speeding up the Government's arrangements for phasing-in. So again, our Amendment No. 77 has had to be ruled out of order. Again, the Money Resolution has been so drawn as to prevent our querying whether there ought to be two rates, a higher and a lower, at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the invalidity allowance, we were in order in suggesting that, bearing in mind the stringent financial position in which these people find themselves, we ought at least to put them all on the higher rate. We had a very searching and constructive debate on that particular aspect of the nuts and bolts. That is what the Committee stage should be about. I agree with the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames, but I wish his party would live up to his protestations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I consider it a scandal that this Committee is now inhibited by the Government from amending any of the details of the new proposals for the attendance allowances. We are inhibited. I hope due note will be taken of this restriction on a democratic Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[Sir STEPHEN MCADDEN in the Chair]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I shall be able to put some concrete, constructive and important points of detail to the Minister. Yet he has tied his own hands, presumably, in accepting the restrictions. It is, I repeat, a scandal. It certainly would be wrong for us to allow this important part of the Bill to go through without discussion. If we cannot vote on these details, at least let us discharge our responsibiities by examing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first piece of nuts and bolts I want to deal with is the coverage of the proposed new increases. This depends very much on the criteria of eligibility. We all know—and hon. Members on both sides of the House have fought on this issue during recent months—that the previous strict criterion of frequent and constant attention and supervision by day and night ruled out thousands of deserving cases. Many examples were brought to the attention of the Government. On the old basis, only 80,000 disabled people—so severely disabled that they need frequent and constant attention—have qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0724">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>301</span>
We welcome the fact that the Secretary of State has had second thoughts on this criterion. Both sides of the House can claim credit for that because we have all had to deal with individual constituency cases. We have fought those cases, and on both sides of the House we had the courage to tell the Government that the old criterion really would not do. The Government have been compelled to listen because the size of the injustice under the old criterion is proved by the fact that the Government now estimate that not 80,000 people will qualify, but some 250,000 people will qualify. This is a good result of the political auctioneering to which the hon. Gentleman referred so disparagingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a misrepresentation of the way progress is made to say that it is political auctioneering when, in turn, each side tries to force the other to more rapid progress. This is part of the dynamic of democracy, but it is relevant to what I shall go on to say. If the Government had not heeded that piece of pressure from both sides of the House, we should—by common consent—have been doing a massive injustice to some 170,000 severely disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to my secont point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. A. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Knowing that the right hon. Lady wants to be fair, I feel she should concede, before leaving this part of her argument, that while it is true to say we have been, perhaps, overlooking the 170,000 to which she refers, until the introduction of the constant attendance allowance we were overlooking 250,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh yes, of course, but the introduction of the attendance allowance is another fruit of the political autioneering process. The concept of the attendance allowance was first put before the House of Commons in the Labour Government's 1969 National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill. That would have been on the Statute Book if we had not lost the election in June 1970. The hon Gentleman is not invalidating my point. He might have begun by doing justice, which the other side failed to do, recognising that the concept of the attendance allowance first appeared in legislative form under a Labour Government. The hon. Gentleman owes us a little justice, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
Point number one is that both sides have accepted it. Both sides have agreed that the original criterion in practice proved to be totally inadequate. The Committee could be kept here for four days by just quoting the individual cases we all know of where the old criterion was inadequate and where, having taken this problem on as a matter of urgency, we were failing in our duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to my next point which is the slow rate at which the new criterion of eligibility is to be phased in. I am well aware that it is a large administrative job. We open the gate to a flood of some half a million claims. I will not pretend for a moment that the Government could vet all those cases in six weeks or six months. I accept that. I accept that there are limitations on the resources for the medical assessment necessary. This is relevant to Amendment No. 77, which we would have moved had we been able. I believe that there is a chance that I might have convinced the Committee—had the Amendment been in order—that it should be accepted. We are now facing an intolerable delay for tragic sections of the disabled by the phasing in programme to which we are committed by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Second Reading debate, the Secretary of State explained to us that the Government intended dividing the applicants into four groups and take them in four tranches: first, those of working age; secondly, the children; thirdly, the elderly—roughly the 65s to 75s; and, fourthly, the very elderly—the 75s and over. He set out to us an elaborate procedure which we could not, in a Second Reading context, examine very carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first group—those of working age—will be invited to put in their claim by December of this year. Each group will be invited to put in its claim six months ahead. As the first group gets paid six months after the claim, the second group will be entitled to put in its claim. So the first group claims in December this year and are paid next June. The second group claim in June and are paid six months later, in December, 1973. The third group—the 65s to 75s—claim in December, 1973, and are paid in June, 1974. The fourth group, the very elderly, the over 75s, cannot claim till June, 1974, and, according to the Secretary of State's timetable, will be paid in December, 1974. The Secretary of State added this on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0725">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>303</span>
Second Reading. He said that at this rate of progress—
	<br><blockquote><p>"We shall be paying for the second group of elderly people "—</p></blockquote>
that is, the last group of all—
	<br><blockquote><p>"from 1st December, 1974."</p></blockquote>
So those born in 1898, who are the youngest to qualify in the group according to Schedule 1, will be 76 or 77 years old before the youngest of them receive it, and many will be a great deal older.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not enter into the argument about whether the Government chose their age order properly, but what worries me is whether those very elderly people even qualify on 1st December, 1974. On Second Reading the right hon. Gentleman was far from clear about that. I tried to cross-examine him, but one cannot conduct a Committee debate during Second Reading. I pointed out to the right hon. Gentleman that according to the Financial Memorandum the cost of the extension of the attendance allowance under the new criteria would rise to £11 million in 1973–74. That is when the first two groups will receive payment. After the figure of £11 million there was an asterisk indicating a note which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Rising eventually to about £45 million."</p></blockquote>
Presumably we reach the maximum figure of £45 million when all the claims have been met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Secretary of State if that meant that, as he had said, that the phasing in of the very elderly would be completed by December, 1974, the cost in 1974–75 would be £45 million. It seemed logical. The right hon. Gentleman replied that the phasing in would be completed by December, 1974. The cost of the complete phasing in is £45 million. I suggested that it inevitably meant that the cost would rise to £45 million in 1974–75. I ask the Committee to listen carefully to the Secretary of State's answer:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To be precise, it will be 1975–76 when it reaches the full £45 million, because the benefits will not all be paid on 1st December, 1974."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 18th May, 1972; Vol. 837, 	<i>cc</i>. 723–4.]</p></blockquote>
The Committee will be concerned at that reply. We were given broad brash assurances on Second Reading that the phasing in would be completed by December, 1974. But the Secretary of State went on to say that the phasing in would not be completed by that date. The reason is presumably that the elderly
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
and the very elderly are so used to their present circumstances. In rectifying the injustice, we start with the narrow end of the wedge and as the application broadens out to the larger groups, we are carried—where? It is about that that I want a firm answer this morning. Are the elderly, severely disabled people who need frequent and constant attendance and supervision to be made to wait into 1975–76? If not, the Government's arithmetic does not make sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the right hon. Lady does not want to be unfair. The simple answer to her question is that some of the applications will not be in by then. We have already learned by experience that the process tends to be held up by people not actually applying. That is why the process may continue into the following year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that exactly brings me to our Amendment No. 77. When do we want these sums to be in payment? The broad impression we were given on Second Reading—we were even told that phasing in might be done over 18 months—was that the Government had worked out carefully these six-monthly 	<i>tranches</i>—as one group began to be paid, another batch of claims would come in. The hon. Gentleman is now saying that some of the very elderly and severely disabled people will not have put in their claims. Hon. Members can imagine why not: they are the last to hear about such things. They may not even have a television set. They are the people who are always slowest at pushing their own needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will those people be paid retrospectively to December, 1974? The Bill rules out any retrospective payment. The hon. Gentleman has just had a confabulation, however, and now says that the answer is, "Yes." But the Bill says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An attendance allowance shall not be payable to a person for any period preceding the date on which he makes a claim for it".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman has told us that some of the claims will still be coming in into 1975–76. Our Amendment would have obliged the Government to make the payment six months retrospectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may explain to the right hon. Lady that she has read the Bill wrongly. The date of payment, provided that the person claims, will be taken back to the first date when that particular
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0726">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>305</span>
group was eligible, in exactly the same way as when the first phase which is now being carried out. It was back-dated for those who claimed to the beginning of the allowance, namely, December, 1971. The same rule will apply in the take-on period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be the hon. Gentleman's intention, but can he do it under the Bill?
	<br><blockquote><p>"An attendance allowance shall not be payable to a person for any period preceding the date on which he makes a claim."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the right hon. Lady tell me where she quoted from?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (3) of Clause 2. I am dealing with the nuts and bolts. We put down an Amendment which was ruled out of order because of the Money Resolution. Is it not a scandal, I ask again, that the Money Resolution has been so drawn? As a result of our discussion, the hon. Member may say, "Perhaps there is a problem here and we will look at it on Report," but the Money Resolution would have to be amended to allow him to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I consider this an abuse of Committee procedure. I ask the hon. Gentleman to look seriously into that matter. I should have thought that the least the Committee wanted was a guarantee that this very elderly group should all be paid, every man jack of them, whenever their claims were put in, not later than December, 1974. We want to be sure that that is the minimum. I ask the hon. Gentleman to give us that absolute guarantee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the hon. Gentleman can do that, the Opposition still say that it is not good enough. We are reaching a position where the largest group—and some of us have a suspicion that that is why the Government have chosen that order of age priorities—will not be paid until December, 1974, and we are not yet in December, 1972. It is not an 18-month phasing: it is a two-and-half year phasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two and a half years is too long to make 200,000 of the 250,000 who qualify wait. Do we not think it is too long, having made all the appeals to the Government that we have made during the past few months, welcoming, as we all do, the change in the criteria. Is two and a half years all we can do administratively? I beg the Committee to think about it. Are we to have two and a half years of
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
bringing cases to the Minister, tragic cases that we all know about, where there is an obvious need and an obvious eventual qualification for the allowance, only to have the Minister say that with the phasing in none of the clams can be paid before December, 1974? The Bill inhibits the payment of claims to the most tragic group before 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 77 would reduce that two and a half year period to two years since it seeks to leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"not be payable to a person for any period" and to substitute</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"be payable for a period of 6 months",</p></blockquote>
Subsection (3) would then read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An attendance allowance shall be payable for a period of six months preceding the date on which he makes a claim for it".</p></blockquote>
The Bill says that he cannot make a claim except within the schedule that the Government will draw up and announce in the House. Is it so much to ask? We have had no Government concessions in the Committee. Would this not be the place for a reasonable, minor, constructive Amendment to embellish the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Usually when a Bill goes through the sort of examination that the Committee are giving this it comes out with some improvement; or why else should we spend out mornings sitting here? If Amendment No. 77 could have been accepted, group one, the working age group, could have been paid in June, 1973, from December, 1972; group two would have been paid in December, 1973, but from June, 1972; group three would have been paid in June, 1974, but from December, 1973, retrospectively; group four would have been paid in December, 1974, but from June, 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not ideal. I am not pretending that that is as good as having an entirely different schedule of payments. A period of two and a half years, recognising all the administrative difficulties—and I have been in Government and I know about administrative difficuty—is too long. What we are asking for is a different timetable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have said that it is administratively impossible to do it in under two and a half years. It will be more than that. We have heard that some of it will go on to 1975 or 1976—three years, or three and a half years. If that is so impossible, why should these people be penalised for the administrative delays? Why cannot we speed up the date of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0727">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
entitlement in each case? That would ensure that none of the most elderly who were not dealt with by December, 1974, would be penalised, if they put in their claims in June, 1974. Is that too much to ask of the Government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another improvement in the provisions I am putting to the hon. Gentleman. The 1970 Act states that attendance allowance is payable only in respect of a qualifying condition which has lasted for the preceding six months—one would have to be in a clearly disabled, incapacitated and helpless condition for at least six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received a letter and enclosed memorandum from a Mr. Plunkett entitled "Care of the dying". He raises the problems of home nursing a person with terminal disease. It is a valid consideration. I had not stopped to think about it until I read his letter. As hon. Members will see, his document is signed by a number of doctors and nurses. He says that we should all give more thought to that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Health Service is geared to curing people, but is hospital the right place to deal with terminal disease? Mr. Plunkett's memorandum says that every person has the right to die in the environment of his own home, provided that a member of the family is prepared to undertake the task of giving the necessary attention. In many cases, it is not so much the need for medicine, but love and care and the ability to be within earshot whenever the patient is awake. Is it not time that we showed a little more concern to the circumstances which surround the death of these people?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have probably all got an elderly relative. We have to face the fact that he will die, but we do not want to put him in a hospital or a home. It is a enormous problem. Mr. Plunkett's memorandum sets out a succession of sensible suggestions about how we may help relatives to deal with that situation. He specifically raisest he point about the six-month waiting period for the attendance allowance. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Attendance allowances is not workable for terminal cases as the Act stands at present. The six month period should not apply in these cases, because many do not live over the six months."</p></blockquote>
Yet it is an element in dealing with the problem of getting terminal cases out of hospital and, more humanly, getting the
	<span class='label label-info column'>308</span>
dying relative into an environment where death is more bearable. This is just where attendance is so necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My own experience is that, to give the patient full advantage of the care that they should receive, one has to be within earshot all night. There is also the need for drug control when the patient is awake, but even when asleep they need some attention. In all terminal cases they need the benefit of the extra money that the allowance would give them. These people deserve the full amount that can be given, and not some reduced amount which is not sufficient for the patient's exceptional circumstances."</p></blockquote>
Could we not modify the provisions of the Bill? Would that be possible? I do not know. I should like the hon. Gentleman to tell us whether it is possible to do it and whether he is willing to do it so that the six-month rule may be waived in terminal cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This also raises in an acute form the question of whether we ought to have a lower rate of attendance allowance at all. As he said, these cases need a larger amount. In these terminal cases, unless one can prove that constant frequent attention and so on is needed during the night as well as during the day, only the lower rate will be paid. The higher rate of £5 odd will still apply only where we can prove the "day and night" formula that many of us have found so difficult to prove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings me to another constructive piece of nuts and bolts. I ask the hon. Gentleman whether he is satisfied that the administration of the attendance allowance is humane even within the present rules. Sometimes there are cases in which the medical ruling seems absolutely inexplicable. What explanatory instructions, if any, have been sent to the medical profession? In Second Reading debates, one cannot go into these details, but it is important that the Committee should know how the medical administration is controlled. Do we just say, "Oh, it is a clinical judgment," and leave it at that? Have there been no discussions with the BMA? Have there been no indications by the Government that they think an interpretation should be this or should be that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason for my concern and curiosity is that I am currently dealing with a case in my own constituency. It was brought to my attention, incidentally, by the National Federation of Old Age Pensions Associations which has its headquarters in my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0728">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>309</span>
constituency. It is always sending these cases to me, but this stands to be dealt with under the current formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to read an explanation of the case sent to me by the General Secretary of the National Federation. He writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mrs. H has had D.S."—</p></blockquote>
disseminated schlerosis:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for over 20 years, add last year she applied for attendance allowance; her own doctor … visited her but she was turned down "—</p></blockquote>
I understand the doctor supported her application:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"but she later appealed against the decision and a Dr. Lee of Blackpool visited her. Again her case was rejected … Mrs. H cannot walk, and she moves around the house in a wheelchair; apparently her appeal was turned down because she had good use of her arms and could lift herself from a chair to a wheelchair. She developed muscular spasms for which she was given Palfium tablets, but this is a potent drug and she cannot remain on this constantly, although she has been having them for 12 months. Her own doctor has had to discontinue this treatment, and she now has two injections a week, given to her by a district nurse—these are cortisone injections, and she also has a bed bath given by the nurse, she also has tablets to take."</p></blockquote>
She is one of those well down on the list:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mrs. H is 63, and her husband is 60, but at the present time her husband has had to stop work because of high blood pressure, brought on presumably by worry of his wife, and he has to lift her, help her to dress, to use the commode, and he has to get up several times in the night to render to her needs. Since the use of Palfium was discontinued, she cannot use her arms, and cannot even lift herself and her condition has deteriorated greatly. My concern is that Mr. H is always on hand to see to Mrs. H's needs, but the strain on him has had an effect on his health. Neither of these people complain, but it would seem that they should be entitled to some allowance seeing that their present circumstances have altered. If you could do anything at all to help these people, it would be greatly appreciated."</p></blockquote>
I took the case up with the Secretary of State. I have recently received a letter from him setting out the paraphernalia that has been gone through, such as the appeal, and an application before a medical practitioner acting on behalf of the attendance allowance board. He stated that after considering all the evidence he decided that Mrs. H did not need attention or supervision to the extent specified in the Act and the claim was accordingly disallowed. So Mrs. H appealed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Arrangements were therefore made for her to be examined by a doctor, not her own, who completed a further medical report … The
	<span class='label label-info column'>310</span>
whole of the evidence including her comments was then referred to another delegated medical practitioner acting on behalf of the Board, but he was unable to revise the original decision ... However, in view of your representations and the letter from the Old Age Pensioners Association, which suggests that Mrs. H's condition had deteriorated, the papers have been seen again …"</p></blockquote>
I do not know the answer. I can only hope that the claim will be successful. What would have happened if the Federation had not known of Mrs. H and referred her case to her Member of Parliament? It is extraordinary that through all this medical review apparatus the verdict should always be the same. I am worried because if the case does not qualify under day and night provisions it will not qualify under either. With the strength in her arms that she is supposed to have, she might be told that she can get out of bed and put herself on the commode at night, without disturbing her husband. A more imaginative definition of frequent attention throughout the day and prolonged or frequent attention throughout the night is required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Madel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that the case about which the right hon. Lady has just told us shows that the question of reinvestigating application for a constant attendance allowance is the sort of thing the health ombudsman should consider. It is one of his functions. Therefore it is essential to have a sufficient number of ombudsmen covering all sections of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to find in the hon. Member an ally in a battle that I have been trying to conduct about the nature of the Health Service Commissioner we will have. I have been pressing for an early debate on the proposals. We have been told that legislation cannot be made until the Government legislate for the reorganisation of the National Health Service. The Government should have put a short Bill before the House urgently on the role of the ombudsman for the Health Service. In his statement to the House, the Secretary of State seemed to suggest that the ombudsman could not, in any sense, interfere with the clinical judgment of the doctor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we get too far on the question of a National Health Service ombudsman, I can see that it is relevant,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0729">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>311</span>
but it is a little beyond the scope of the debate on the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Madel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the difficulties, Sir Stephen. May I ask for a further ruling? We do get these cases and this is a desperately important debate that the right hon. Lady has instigated. Without wishing to disagree with you, it goes even wider. How can people be given the levers of appeal? How can one make sure that the levers of appeal on these matters are known to them? It is one of the most difficult things to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not said for a moment that it was out of order. I said that if we launch ourselves into a full scale debate on the question of a National Health Service ombudsman we shall be out of order. Certainly, it is permissible to make a reference, and say that if we had such a person many of the problems to which the right hon. Lady referred could be ironed out more easily. But one should not project oneself into a full scale debate on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This would not be considered by the medical ombudsman, because as yet the normal medical processes have not been gone through. She would have already been rejected by the medical ombudsman because she was interfering as a Member before the doctors had finished. This is the whole weakness of the medical ombudsman. The approach must come from a Member of Parliament, and not wait on the medical process to be completed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both hon. Gentlemen are right in this sense. Obviously, if the ombudsman existed and if any clinical considerations had not been ruled out of his sphere of influence, which the Secretary of State looks like trying to do, I would not, at this stage, have taken it to him, because a review was taking place and I hope the review will be successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel) is right. There are medical people who are consulted by the attendance allowance board. They carry out the first consideration. They then carry out the appeal review. They then perhaps carry out a third function. They succeed, none the less, in turning down a case like this. This is
	<span class='label label-info column'>312</span>
extremely worrying. How can we get a more humane administration of the present criteria which will help us with the new criteria?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they rule out my constituent under the present criteria on the grounds she seems to be ruled out, she would be ruled out under the new criteria—if she is still alive by the time they apply to her. How can we influence the way in which doctors make their judgments? How can we influence the doctors' interpretation of the Bill? What discussions have the Government had with the BMA? Have there been any meetings at which all these medical advisers, attendance boards, and the rest of it, are called together? How is the climate of medical judgment being influenced in these cases? Has it been adversely influenced? Have the Government influenced it at all? If they have not, will they now influence it favourably?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will you please do something to spare us from these absurd rulings in cases where, for example, the health of the husband is being systematically undermined because he is not being given financial help?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will have two disabled people on your hands shortly. I hope that there will be a double attendance allowance to compensate for the time during which the husband's health has been ruined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the right hon. Lady is not blaming me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, Sir Stephen. There are many things I might blame you for, but not in your capacity as Chairman. As Chairman you are impeccable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But is one to stand by and see the husband reduced in health before one can say that an attendance allowance is payable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to say a word about our old friend, the adequacy of amounts. I repeat, we put down Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 to increase both the higher and lower rates. They were ruled out of order, so there was no point in putting down a similar Amendment to that which we have put down on the invalidity allowance, to make both sets of cases payable at the higher rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But is it necessary to fix a lower rate of a mere £3.60 to help people in the sort of situations in which so many of our constituents find themselves? Is it not cruel? First, people are turned down because they cannot prove how many times the wife or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0730">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>313</span>
the husband has to get out of bed in the night to take the disabled person to the lavatory. Then the Government say, "Ah well, we agree that that is a bit harsh, so we shall make provision for day or night." The Government then say, "Mind you, it will be two and a half years before it comes into payment." After all that, the Government then tell such people that when they receive payment it will not be the normal attendance allowance but will be £3.60.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to enter into a statistical tumble with the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Lamont). I am sorry that the hon Gentleman is not in the Committee Room at present, because I had a little more educating of him to do before the end of the morning. I must point out to the hon. Gentleman that not only in speech was he deriding us for wrongly abusing the Committee stage, not only is it the Government that have abused the Committee stage by denying us a chance to vote on these matters, but I should have liked to have had a word with him about the inflationary situation we face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All right. Some of these people will not receive their £3.60 for another two and a half years, three or three and a half years. Imagine what it will be worth by the time they receive it. There can be other upratings. I accept that. But it is such a low starting point that there will have to be massive upratings. I say only this to the hon. Gentleman the Member for Kingston-upon-Thames, when he had great play and fun with my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) about
	<span class='label label-info column'>314</span>
accuracy of statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to place on the record one little correction which I am sorry the hon. Gentleman is not in the Committee to hear. He derided my hon. Friend for predicting a rate of inflation in the coming 12 months of between 8 and 10 per cent. He said that my hon. Friend was shocking to be so loose with his facts and figures. The hon. Gentleman said that the National Institute had forecast a rate of inflation not between 7 and 10 per cent., but of 7.1 per cent. exactly. Did it? I wonder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The leading article in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> yesterday shows that the National Institute predicted a higher figure than that. Since then there has been this disastrous slump in the value of the pound that we have euphemistically called "floating." As the pound sinks rather than floats, do the hon. Gentlemen and the Committee think that that lower rate of £3.60 is still adequate? Surely the Government recognise that their tentative beginnings with their good intentions are being undermined by the collapse of their economic policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We return to the question which has been raised time and again in the Committee. Who is to bear the burden of that collapse? That is the challenge to our society. Do not let it be the disabled and the poor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
