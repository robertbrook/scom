</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Edmund Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was much encouraged during the Minister's speech when he took up some of the points that had been raised on these Amendments relating to the proposed West Yorkshire County. He said that any proposals which transferred areas of population from the proposed metropolitan district (	<i>b</i>) to the proposed metropolitan district (	<i>e</i>) would be looked upon with favour. He referred to the proposal enshrined in Amendments 234 and 235 relating to the urban district of Horbury which is adjacent to Wakefield County Borough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>600</span>
The Minister asked if I could provide evidence about the feelings of the local population in Horbury regarding this transfer. Using the opportunity of the Recess, such evidence has now been provided and within the urban district of Horbury an opinion poll has been held, the results of which I am able to give the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the outset, we attempted to get round the whole electorate of Horbury, but in the time available just 43 per cent. of the total electorate was contacted, although the 43 per cent. was spread as fairly as possible through all the electoral polling areas of Horbury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From this poll, in which ballot boxes were taken round to people's front doors for them to be able to cast their votes secretly, the total number of ballot papers counted was 2,457. Out of a total population of 8,914—not electorate—this represents a very large sample. Of the votes counted and not spoiled, 226 indicated preference for Horbury's inclusion in the district of West Yorkshire (	<i>d</i>) which includes Huddersfield and Dewsbury, and 2,131 votes were cast in favour of Horbury's inclusion in District (	<i>e</i>), which includes Wakefield and Pontefract. So it is a virtually 10 to 1 majority in favour of Horbury's inclusion in the Metropolitan District West Yorkshire (	<i>e</i>). Among the valid votes counted, 19.3 per cent. of the sample favoured inclusion of Horbury in the Metropolitan District (	<i>e</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is overwhelming evidence of the wishes of the people of Horbury. I was able to visit the area during the Recess and, travelling by road from Wakefield to Horbury, I was hardly aware of moving from the county borough into the urban districts. The Ml motorway runs through, but certainly in this instance, and probably in most others where motorways are proposed as boundaries between local authorities, the motorway has more of an attracting effect than a repelling effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Travelling further on the A642 from Wakefield to Huddersfield one goes through Horbury and then continues over the River Calder and through a village called Middlestown. Middlestown is, in effect, one of the parts of the parish of Sitlington in the Wakefield Rural District, which is to be included in Metropolitan District (	<i>e</i>) based upon Wakefield, and we have the situation where two parts of the proposed district, namely Wakefield
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>601</span>
and Sitlington, are joined by a main road which passes through Horbury. Therefore, there is an argument for Horbury to be included in the same metropolitan district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the situation concerning Ossett, which neighbours both Horbury and Wakefield, obviously if Horbury is transferred from Metropolitan District (	<i>d</i>) to Metropolitan District (	<i>e</i>), then the case for Ossett similarly to be transferred is strengthened. Another public opinion survey has been conducted during the recess within the Borough of Ossett and I have the results here, but because Ossett has a larger population than Horbury, it was not quite such an ambitious survey, and the aim was to cover 1 in 10 of the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have here one of the ballot papers, which looks very official and looks like a normal election ballot paper. Altogether 1,146 were issued, which compares with 1,246—one-tenth of the Horbury electorate. Of the valid, unspoilt ballot papers counted there were 781 in favour of the inclusion of Ossett in Metropolitan District (	<i>e</i>) based on Wakefield, and 91 in favour of inclusion with District (	<i>d</i>), which includes Dewsbury and Hudders-field. So, although the majority is not quite so overwhelming as in the case of Horbury, 82.3 per cent. of the sample is in favour of Ossett's inclusion in the metropolitan district which includes Wakefield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the map one sees the close affinity between Ossett and Horbury. Socially, in a number of ways they are linked. I know from my own experience that Ossett and Horbury are within the same organisational unit of the Methodist Church which is strong in that part of the country. Similarly, if one looks at the community of interest, it will be seen that Ossett looks towards Wakefield as strongly as it looks in any other direction. There may be spheres of open country dotted around Ossett, but there is certainly a belt of open area which divides Ossett from the County Borough of Dewsbury. Thus Ossett has as strong a case for inclusion with Wakefield as for inclusion the other way. In view of the results of public opinion in the area, I submit that the case for Ossett, as in the case of Horbury, for inclusion in metropolitan district (	<i>e</i>) is very strong indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before adjourning for
	<span class='label label-info column'>602</span>
the Recess, I think that we had all been greatly impressed by the Minister's statement. It appeared that his approach was flexible, and that he intended to give full weight to all the local issues involved. As my hon. Friend has said, and as all of us on this side of the Committee feel, this was of tremendous importance, and something which should be taken into account. I shall not therefore labour this point this morning, since there is a great deal of work ahead of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, to sum up, it would seem that not only would it look right for Horbury to go to Wakefield, but that that decision is the wish of the people of Horbury, in accordance with the ballot which has taken place. Those facts, I believe, would give the Minister the case that he wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect to Ossett, there is a distinction. Perhaps I should not use the phrase "Judgment of Solomon" in this case, because, as one hon. Member pointed out, that judgment was not carried into effect. However, whatever the Minister may ultimately decide in the case of Ossett, I hope that it will go with one group or another as an entity rather than that it should be split. Is the Minister now able to tell us exactly what he intends to do, or would he prefer to wait until a later stage, having given full consideration to all that has been said?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before touching on the point of Horbury and Ossett I should like to mention two cases where I expressed some doubt during my speech at our last Sitting. I suggested that there might be a case for moving some areas to the North-West of the conurbation, such as the Ilkley area. However, I have looked again at that situation, and I believe it is impossible to make any move in that regard. One must leave the whole string of towns along the Wharfe dependent on Bradford and on Leeds within the conurbation, to include Wetherby and the villages along the road from Leeds to Wetherby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also referred to Wentbridge, which the hon. Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall) referred to during our previous Sitting. This is a small but extremely complicated matter, which I believe should be left to the Boundary Commission. I do not think that we in this Committee should endeavour to decide this sort of parish division. I hope therefore that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0333">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>603</span>
Boundary Commission in due course will look at this matter, and either put the Chancellor of the Exchequer's garden in with his house or his house with his garden, whichever is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to Horbury and Ossett. I am grateful to those who have worked on this subject in those areas since our last Sitting. Indeed, Horbury has held a poll on the question, as has Ossett, and the Committee has heard the figures relating to those decisions. I hope that the Committee will be able to reach a decision on this matter. Although I said on the last occasion that I was not convinced that Ossett should be included with the Wakefield area, having regard to the poll—which I think was very genuinely taken—and to the fact that on the previous judgment it was only the casting vote of the mayor which allied Ossett with Dewsbury and Huddersfield, I believe it reasonable that both Horbury and Ossett should be included within the Wakefield district. Both areas are in favour of that decision, and there is no real planning or development reason against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt in my mind that Horbury is attached to Wakefield. One has only to stand under the bridge on the Ml and the same town is on either side. That being the case with respect to Horbury and Wakefield, there is very little boundary between Horbury and Ossett. Of course, attachments exist between Ossett and Dewsbury, but I believe that the attachments between Wakefield and Ossett are much stronger. For those reasons, I ask the Committee to accept the Amendments which suggest the inclusion of Horbury and Ossett within the district of Wakefield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marcus Fox</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to refer to the speech made by the hon. Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall) at our last meeting, with respect to Amendments Nos. 157,159 and 161. The Minister has just referred to the situation of the village of Wentbridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Goole also referred to the fact that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer lives in this village. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am not fully conversant with the facts, but I understand that the parish boundary between Thorpe Audlin and Kirk Smeaton goes
	<span class='label label-info column'>604</span>
through his garden, but I do not know on which side of the line his house lies. Under the Bill, that line will become a county boundary between West Yorkshire and North Yorkshire.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Some effort should be made in this Committee to ensure that the community of Went-bridge is incorporated in one parish in one county."—[OFFICIAL REPORT. 	<i>Standing Committee D,</i> 21st December. 1971: 	<i>c.</i> 577.]</p></blockquote>
I would not disagree with that. The Minister himself is in some doubt in this situation. I can understand his confusion. I have a map which shows very clearly that the Chancellor's house has always been in the West Yorkshire county. However. I cannot understand or condone the article which appeared in the 	<i>New Statesman</i> of 17th December—over which I believe that the right hon. Member for Coventry, East (Mr. Crossman) has some control, in his arrogant, intellectual way—to the effect that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One small, little publicised boundary alteration in Peter Walker's Local Government Bill is the inclusion of a strip of South Yorkshire in the new county of North Yorkshire."</p></blockquote>
I have no idea where South Yorkshire comes from; it is nut even involved in this area.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Perhaps Mr. Walker will defend it as part of the general tightening up of the metropolitan areas: but I can tell him that the inhabitants of Wentbridge"—</p></blockquote>
I wager the right hon. Gentleman has never been to Wentbridge, let alone consulted the inhabitants—
	<br><blockquote><p>"have already made up their minds about the reason for the change. To them it is a device to ensure that the village's most prestigious resident—Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Anthony Barber, is not put to the indignity of living in a Labour-controlled local authority—an inevitable consequence of leaving either Wentbridge in West Yorkshire or switching it to South Yorkshire. On the whole there has been very little gerrymandering in the new proposals; but Peter Walker will be hard put to explain away this particular protrusion on the local government map."</p></blockquote>
Never have I seen such a short article containing so many inaccuracies. I intend to put this right, and I trust that the right hon. Gentleman will give the same prominence to my comments as he has given to his own. I want to defend my right hon. Friend the Chancellor from these insinuations, not because he is Chancellor of the Exchequer but because he happens to be a Yorkshireman, and we are just as proud of our county as the Welshmen are of theirs—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. The hon. Gentleman is guilty of a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0334">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>605</span>
slip of the tongue. I am sure that he did not mean to call Wales a county. We are very proud that the Leader of the Opposition is a Yorkshireman, but he recognises Wales as a nation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fox</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. My purpose is to try to get some Welsh Member to make a sensible contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The map shows quite clearly that in the White Paper, and in the boundary changes made when the Bill was published, the house that we are concerned with has always been within the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County. Anyone who has taken the trouble to look at the map will know that there has never been the sort of gerrymandering that is suggested. One should quote here, I think, my right hon. Friend's only observation on this issue:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"It seems certainly odd to me that the village is to be cut down the middle. I want what is best for the village. But I am not the Membei of Parliament for the area, so I will not intervene."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the hon. Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall) will confirm that the Chancellor has not intervened. Nor has he made any representation to anyone to get this changed. I want to make it clear that it does no good to the work of the Committee if we are accused unwarrantably, in articles of this kind, of being involved in this sort of thing.

My purpose is to put the record straight. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has no need himself to put this right, but I feel that it is my duty to point out that the right hon. Member for Coventry, East (Mr. Crossman), whose mistakes in office are still remembered, is the last person who should give advice in matters of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move to Amendment No. 158, on which I spoke at our last meeting, which concerns the situation of Harrogate and the change which was brought about, which took Harrogate out of the West Yorkshire metropolitan county and placed it into the North Yorkshire non-metropolitan county. I have read again the comments of my hon. Friend the Minister, and in the Recess I spent a considerable amount of time on this matter. I cannot accept the arguments that he presented. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones) when he said at our last sitting, at 	<i>c.</i> 558:
	<span class='label label-info column'>606</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"There has been some difficulty in working out the boundary as defined and there has not been the care in denning the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County as in other areas."</p></blockquote>
It is not too late for the Secretary of State to put this matter right. In all seriousness, I say that we must get—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox) has given the right column number. Column 558 deals with Lancashire in a speech by the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Gordon Oakes).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fox</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. Sir Stephen. I am one of those rare politicians who are always prepared to admit an error. The column is 588. and reads:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government have had to face the problems of the creation of a metropolitan county borough based on West Yorkshire, but they have done it in a very rough way. They have not had regard to communities of interest to the extent that I have seen and welcomed elsewhere."—[OFFICIAL RFPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D.</i> 21st December, 1971; 	<i>c.</i> 588.]</p></blockquote>
It is this concern that causes me to press this point, and if we had been treated like the West Midlands Metropolitan County I think these difficulties would have been overcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The West Midlands is a smaller area, with admittedly a larger population, but it has two more metropolitan districts—seven in all. I believe that one of them contains only two parliamentary seats. Looking at the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County and the Leeds District 6(	<i>b</i>) in particular, with eight parliamentary seats involved, I believe there could have been room for manoeuvre and the possibility of an extra district being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I further understand that the City of Leeds has never asked for an extension of its boundaries; rather has it given evidence to the contrary. Could my hon. Friend see fit to investigate the possibility of Harrogate and perhaps certain others of what I call the free-standing towns, and possibly other parts of Wharfedale, being included in a new district, keeping Harrogate in particular within the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County? Alternatively—and I think this may be a forlorn hope—is it possible to return to the proposals in the White Paper?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The dominance which I suggested in the City of Leeds caused me some concern. We now learn, with the publication of council seats, that there are to be 96 seats in this district, 63 of which will come
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0335">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>607</span>
from the City of Leeds. I do not think that my previous observance can be described as an exaggeration in view of these figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County, the Cities of Leeds and Bradford will have 33 seats out of 88, and it is unthinkable to me that an area of the size of Harrogate should be removed from this county to make the preponderance of seats for these two cities even more obvious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard nothing during the Recess that makes me believe that Harrogate's affinity is with North Yorkshire. It is a great pity that we are working, so far as transportation figures are concerned, on the 1966 survey, because the Minister accepts, according to c. 591 of the last Sitting of the Committee, that there is a strong commuter run from Harrogate to Leeds. On the 1966 figures this is obvious. I think that five years later it is not a commuter run—it is a mad scramble—and if one were to station oneself at the junction a few miles outside Harrogate, where the Leeds-Bradford roads part, and see the traffic there between 8 and 9.30 in the morning and 4.30 and 6.0 p.m., there would be no doubt as to where the people of Harrogate earn their living. I would also mention a two-way movement, in that there are now people who live in Leeds and work in Harrogate. The interdependence of these two places, I should have thought, was self-evident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made an intervention during the last Committee Sitting on the matter of the number of retired people who live in Harrogate. My purpose was simply to point out to the Minister that the bulk of the people who live in Harrogate, whether they be employed or retired, come from the West Riding of Yorkshire, and from Leeds and Bradford in particular. I think that it would be fair to suggest that Harrogate would not be in the position that it is today were it not for the prosperity of the Leeds-Bradford area and the industrial parts of Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not claim that the whole of the tourist industry in Harrogate is dependent upon Yorkshire, but I do claim that there are many local people and the patronage of industry in our Yorkshire cities has much to do with keeping many of these hotels in business. The financial functions which Leeds offers are obviously
	<span class='label label-info column'>608</span>
of great advantage to Harrogate. The regional centres of many Government departments are established in Leeds. Harrogate looks southwards for those services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is the headquarters of the Leeds Regional Hospital Board in Harrogate if it is not a two-way movement? The West Yorkshire Road Car Company is also based on Harrogate and serves the residents of Leeds who are the largest users of that company. All this adds strength to the previous argument which I put to the Minister to rescind the decision when the Bill was published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To talk of Harrogate's having affinities with the North Riding is to suggest that it has much in common with Ripon, Thirsk, Northallerton, York and Skipton. It has no such thing. The functions of those market towns are entirely different. Their social structure is different and their character is different. I am sure that members of the Committee are conversant with all the reports which have been made on local government—the Redcliife-Maud Royal Commission, the previous Government's White Paper and the present Government's White Paper. All of them suggested that Harrogate be put with the West Yorkshire area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept that this battle is not important. In all this we are planning for the future. I cannot believe that the future of Harrogate and Leeds is to be divorced. Rather I would think that the two will come together. It is important in the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County, in which my constituency lies and in which I reside, that we keep a social balance. We want more equitable distribution of rateable value. I realise that I am on somewhat dangerous ground, but I think that these arguments must be put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Harrogate has a high proportion of people—I use the census definition—in sections 1 and 2. Those people are needed, and Harrogate is needed, within the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County to counterbalance those parts of the area which are heavily weighted towards groups 4 and 5. I make no apology for saying that the dereliction and neglect within the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County call for strong resources to secure the restoration and renewal of that area. Where people have an affinity, I think that they should rightly be placed within that county.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to make any reference to Wentbridge this morning. However, since the matter has been raised by the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox), I should just like to say that the Minister's decision not to deal with Wentbridge in the Bill but to leave it for the first work of the Local Government Boundary Commission is one which I fully appreciate. To create a separate parish for Wentbridge to be included in one county one way or the other would require mering work to be done by the Ordnance Survey. I accept that it is not really a topic to be included in a Bill of this nature. But I am very glad to have the assurance that it is a matter to which the Local Government Boundary Commission will refer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would answer the point made by the hon. Member for Shipley and confirm that his right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has indeed made no representations with regard to Wentbridge so far as I know. Indeed, it would appear that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is probably as confused about the matter as are we all and accepts that future detailed work by the Boundary Commission is absolutely necessary in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to what the Minister said with regard to Horbury and Ossett, I wish to put on record my sincere thanks to him for the consideration which he has given to the two Amendments and for the way in which he has graciously accepted the Amendments. I know that I can speak for my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Walter Harrison), who represents Horbury, in expressing our thanks. I know from the figures in the opinion polls that I can also express the heartfelt thanks of the vast majority of the people in the two towns. All those concerned are most sincerely grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid I cannot be quite so friendly in my comments in reply to what the Minister said with regard to the designation of West Yorkshire as a metropolitan county and with reference to Amendments Nos. 117, 153 and 164, the effect of which would be to transfer West Yorkshire to the list of counties with non-metropolitan designation. I accept that that would have been the most major change of all the Amendments, but I think that the arguments which the Minister used in speaking against the Amendments
	<span class='label label-info column'>610</span>
were to some extent contradictory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the idea of having metropolitan counties is where there is a clearly defined conurbation, where there is a proper metropolis. The meaning of the word "metropolis" is a mother city. In West Yorkshire there is no one clearly defined mother city. The different county boroughs and the different Pennine valleys are quite separate communities. There is not the overriding sense of unity which perhaps obtains on Merseyside or in the West Midlands. To use the argument that because there is this pattern of community in West Yorkshire it is therefore right for status or designation as a metropolitan county seems to me to be a contradictory proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, however, that at this stage of the proceedings the West Yorkshire egg has probably been well and truly scrambled in this respect, and it would be very difficult at this stage for the tide to be turned and the egg put back in its shell, to use a mixed metaphor. I submit, however, that the egg having been scrambled, we have probably found that we have scrambled a bad egg. I am very much concerned here not just for the sake of West Yorkshire but about the very free and easy way in which metro-politanitis is creeping all round the country. We must look very carefully into the way in which we are using this metropolitan designation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On an issue of this importance, I accept that the Government are in a difficult position. With the possibility that we may return to the matter on Report—an important issue such as this would be—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I rather suspect that the hon. Gentleman is going to take a course of action which I would ask him to delay for a moment or two. A number of Amendments are being discussed with this one. I should like to ascertain whether any other member of the Committee has a contribution to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow the discussion which I took part in before the Christmas Recess. I was not by any means convinced by what my hon. Friend said in his reply about the proper drawing of the northern and northwestern parts of this metropolitan county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At column 590 my hon. Friend said in reply:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>611</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is perfectly true that taking the area to the west we have included a number of areas of moorland …".</p></blockquote>
that was part of my case, but what has clearly happened is that the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County is substantially in contradiction to the advocacy that there has been to the whole concept of metropolitan counties, that the boundaries should be drawn tightly to the built-up and urbanised areas.
	<br><blockquote><p>"We took the boundary as far as Silsden. because that in certain feasibility studies has been recommended as a growth area and it has a future as a growth area at the western end of Airedale."—[OFFICIAL REPORT. 	<i>Standing Committee D,</i> 21st December, 1971; 	<i>c.</i> 590.]</p></blockquote>
There again, there is the contradiction that in other metropolitan areas we have not wanted to see an extension of the urbanisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has been said so often—and the case for the drawing tightly of the metropolitan county boundaries surely rests upon it—is that further expansion should not take place from the perimeter but should take the form of new town development or overspill schemes detached from the metropolitan counties. Looking at the positions of Silsden in relation to Bradford, it seems to me as though it is almost as far distant from the centre of Bradford as Harrogate is from the centre of Leeds. My advocacy, of course, essentially concerns Harrogate, and there is the strongest possible case for the inclusion of Harrogate in the West Yorkshire metropolitan county because of its affinities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox) has been telling us of the close association that exists between Harrogate and Leeds and the large built-up and urbanised area of Leeds and Bradford. If the principle lying behind this metropolitan area is that it should extend to cover towns as far distant as Silsden is from Bradford, and that open area and moorland is to be included, what possible case can apply for the exclusion of Harrogate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend and Member for Shipley has said, in the Royal Commission Report, in the proposals outlined in the White Paper by the previous administration and in the White Paper issued by the present Government Harrogate was included in the West Yorkshire metropolitan area with a population of 62,000 and the close association which my hon. Friend
	<span class='label label-info column'>612</span>
the Member for Shipley has emphasised this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Crosley (Mr. Graham Page) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is a difficult decision to reach whether to include Ilkley. It was not so difficult to come to a decision over Otley because Otley is much closer to a built-up area and development of Leeds."—[OFFICIAL REPORT. 	<i>Standing Committee D,</i> 21st December. 1971; 	<i>c.</i> 590.]</p></blockquote>
So that the closeness or otherwise of these free-standing towns is material to the Government's consideration, and I have yet to understand the Government's argument for taking Harrogate out of the proposals in the White Paper. What I have said has been an endeavour to indicate that there is not and cannot be any substantial case for the inclusion of the towns to the north-west, which are practically as far from the centre of Bradford as Harrogate is from the centre of Leeds. Therefore, what is the case for taking Harrogate out of the metropolitan county as advocated in the White Paper?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not satisfied with the observations which the Minister has so far submitted in reply to my earlier comments. If there is to be rigidity, and if the Government are not prepared in any way to listen to the arguments which have been put forward, I cannot be satisfied with the result of the course that is now proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the very arguments which my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox) has used for the inclusion of Harrogate, we did in the circular forecasting the Bill include Harrogate in this metropolitan area. Looking again and studying it after that, it seemed impossible to include a major town such as Harrogate, divided by such a wide area of countryside which no-one wishes to develop. It seemed impossible to continue with the idea of including that within the conurbation. It is true, of course, as my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley has said, that it has a certain dependency on Leeds. So indeed do many towns outside conurbations. One has to draw the line somewhere for the extension of the conurbations, and the line here is geographically quite plain between Harrogate and Leeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is said that Harrogate is dependent. Of course, it is dependent in many ways, but not so much on the travel-to-work basis. Only six per cent. of the working
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>613</span>
resident population in Harrogate work in the Leeds area, and I include in that area Otley and Horsforth and the fringe of Leeds. That is a very small proportion commuting into Leeds, and from an employment point of view, I do not think that it can be said that Harrogate is so dependent on Leeds that it should be included within the conurbation and such a complete wrench made from principle in drawing the boundaries of the conurbation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the same arguments which have been used that Harrogate should be within the conurbation, the string of towns from Ilkley to Wetherby should be so included. The arguments there are strongly in favour of their inclusion within the conurbation. They are really dependent on Bradford on the one side and Leeds on the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having come to the decision as the Government did to exclude Harrogate from the conurbations, the idea was presented in the Amendments for a separate district around Leeds—a district based perhaps on Pudsey and in a semi-circle around Leeds. We could find no justification for that as a district—a straggling area with no centre, no sort of community interest and, from a development and planning point of view, a hopeless type of district. The only solution, therefore, was to include the fringe towns and authorities to Leeds within the district of Leeds, so dependent on Leeds as to be part and parcel of that district. I agree that it was a difficult matter to decide whether West Yorkshire should be a metropolitan county or a non-metropolitan county. We discussed that point earlier on this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Commenting on what the hon. Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall) said about the meaning of "metropolis", I agree that the word means the capital and the area around the capital. To that extent I suppose that we ought only to use the word in connection with London, and I jibbed, when the White Paper was first drafted, at the use of the word "metropolis", but no one could find a better word. Indeed, I think one understands it at the moment as meaning a built-up area. Thus it is not necessary for a metropolitan area to have the mother city as we understand the word "metropolis" at the present time. It is the continuous built-up area, the areas which are dependent on one
	<span class='label label-info column'>614</span>
another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones) tried to draw a simile between Silsden and Harrogate, but one cannot compare these two towns. They are not alike. The development from the Bradford area to Silsden is entirely different from the open countryside between Leeds and Harrogate. I was basing part of my argument for the inclusion of Silsden on the fact that it would be a growth area and highly dependent on the radiation of employment from the Bradford area. It has been decided not to include Harrogate within the conurbation but to include the row of towns from Ilkley to Wetherby, which are so dependent on Bradford and Leeds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I crave the indulgence of the Committee for bobbing up and down so often. That arises from the fact that I have a finger in many different counties, which is why I come on to the scene again with regard to South Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of Amendments Nos. 395 and 396 would be to transfer the parish of Sykehouse, in my constituency, from the South Yorkshire Metropolitan County to the non-Metropolitan County of Humberside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be seen from the map that the parish of Sykehouse is at the northern end of the Thorne Rural District and adjoins the parishes of Snaith and Cowick immediately to the north which will be included in the County of Humberside. Sykehouse is one of the most remote parts of my constituency, being one of the places which has only two roads and is very difficult to get to without going a long way round. Because of its remoteness it is essentially a rural area, and should not be included within a metropolitan county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic activity of the parish is
	<span class='label label-info column'>616</span>
agriculture. I have received representations from the parish to the effect that its inhabitants would prefer to be included in the County of Humberside, which has many parishes of a similar nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had a letter from the clerk to the parish council asking me to press the Amendment, and a similar letter from the Sykehouse Women's Institute, which is also keen that the parish should be included in Humberside instead of South Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The district authorities at present covering the area seem to agree that Sykehouse is a difficult place to service from any direction because of its remoteness. We therefore have to consider the wishes of the inhabitants when deciding which is the better place for the parish. The parish is divided into five separate hamlets which are included within the Goole postal district, and Goole is to be near the centre of the proposed county of Humberside. I understand that the local newspaper serving Sykehouse is the 	<i>Goole Times,</i> so already it looks towards Goole and not Doncaster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While referring to the parish of Sykehouse I should also say that following the appearance of the proposal for the Humberside County—which came when the Bill was published—some thought was given within the Thorne Rural District as to the correct placing of the district, either in South Yorkshire or Humberside. Opinion is very mixed on the issue. I suggest that when the Local Government Boundary Commission reviews the boundaries of counties it considers the parishes of Stainforth and Hatfield, which look towards Doncaster and belong to the South Yorkshire metropolitan area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In another way, the parish of Thorne looks towards Humberside. Its road and rail communications make it a part of the Humberside area. Another important consideration to which I referred earlier is that the northern boundary of the parish of Thorne—under the Bill it is to be the county boundary between South Yorkshire and Humberside—goes across the middle of one of the proposed sites for a major airport development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In passing, I refer to Thorne Waste, which it would be more convenient to include within one county. This is a consideration which ought to come up when
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0340">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>617</span>
the Local Government Boundary Commission gets down to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also included in this batch of Amendments are Amendments Nos. 397 and 123, standing in my name. Amendment No. 397 is a drafting Amendment, and refers to a place called Hesley. If one looks at the boundaries proposed in the Bill between Nottinghamshire and South Yorkshire, one sees that the north ward of the Parish of Harworth—which essentially comprises a major part of the town of Bawtry—is to be included in the Metropolitan County of South Yorkshire. The effect would be to transfer the little, hook-shaped appendix of North Nottinghamshire into South Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only the north ward of Harworth is dealt with in this way. This will leave an isolated enclave of Nottinghamshire completely surrounded by South Yorkshire—an enclave including the hamlet of Hesley. Hesley is only a small hamlet, but it will be isolated from the main body of the county to which it is assigned under the proposals in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 397 is designed simply to tidy up the enclave position by including the hamlet of Hesley—which is part of the west ward of Harworth—within the South Yorkshire County proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of Amendment No. 123 is to transfer the parish of Finningley from North Nottinghamshire into the Metropolitan County of South Yorkshire. Again, reference to a map shows that Finningley is at the most northern tip of Nottinghamshire and is virtually surrounded by other counties—either the present West Riding of Yorkshire or the Isle of Axholme, which is in Lincolnshire. One can see how closely associated Finningley is with the community looking towards Doncaster, rather than the community of Nottinghamshire as a whole. Finningley is only six or seven miles from Doncaster, but it is 40 miles from Nottingham, which will be the main centre for county services if it becomes part of the new proposed County of Nottinghamshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the local bus services from Finningley travel towards Doncaster. The newspapers serving the area come from Doncaster. Finningley is part of the Doncaster postal district. Because of the bus situation, Doncaster is the main shopping
	<span class='label label-info column'>618</span>
centre for Finningley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finningley stands on the main A614 trunk road, leading from Thorne to Bawtry, and if the proposals in the Bill go through both those places will be included in South Yorkshire. This main road goes into Yorkshire on both sides of the present parish of Finningley. Another aspect is that Finningley almost runs into the neighbouring parish of Blaxton. There is hardly any division between the built-up areas of both villages. Under the proposals in the Bill, Blaxton is included in the South Yorkshire metropolitan area. I understand that Blaxton and Finningley have a joint playing fields association. It is considerations such as these that link the two parishes closely together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although Finningley is in Nottinghamshire many of its schoolchildren attend schools in the present West Riding of Yorkshire. Between 20 and 30 pupils a year travel from Finningley to secondary schools in the West Riding, and two or three primary schoolchildren who are resident in the parish of Finningley attend a West Riding maintained primary school at the RA.F. camp at Finningley, which is on the Yorkshire side of the county boundary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present county boundary between Nottinghamshire and the West Riding of Yorkshire cuts right across the Finningley R.A.F. airfield. The main runway is cut by the county boundary. Aircraft taking off start their journey in Nottinghamshire and are probably on Yorkshire ground before their wheels leave the tarmac. The camp is divided in such a way that many of the administrative and residential buildings associated with the camp are in Yorkshire and most of the tarmac is in Nottinghamshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The R.A.F. at Finningley is closely associated with the R.A.F. at Bawtry and the R.A.F. station at Lindholme, which is close to Hatfield. Both those R.A.F. stations are to be in the proposed South Yorkshire Metropolitan County, and Finningley, rightly, is to be included in the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since this Amendment was tabled considerable feeling has been expressed within the parish of Finningley. I have received three letters from residents, all of whom express opposition to a move to South Yorkshire. It is only right that I should place these representations before
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0341">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>619</span>
the Committee, but I would point out that not one of these letters has put forward any substantive reason for the retention of Finningley within Nottinghamshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I always approach these arguments on the ground of reasonableness, and all the arguments point to Finningley's inclusion in the South Yorkshire Metropolitan County, District (	<i>b</i>). which includes Doncaster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that feeling is against the Amendment.

It appears that any feeling there is is not backed up by solid reasoning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Swain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reference to Amendments Nos. 139, 140 and the consequential Amendments, I should like first to give a brief history of this area over the past five years. In 1967 the Sheffield Order ceded to the City of Sheffield-after representation had been made by the then Sheffield Council to the Minister for an extension of its boundaries to take into account the difficulties it was experiencing with industry, population, and the building of houses—an area containing a population of 33,000. Sheffield made out a very good case at the time, and, unfortunately for the county, the arguments weighed in favour of Sheffield because of the paramount difficulties then being faced. Under the old local government set-up that made a big difference to Derbyshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The urban district of Dronfield and the parishes of Eckington and Killamarsh—which, incidentally, have a population of 32,000 as against the 33,000 who went over—were ceded by the Minister's plan to the South Yorkshire metropolitan district, and there is no argument between the existing Sheffield City Council and the councils controlling the districts which are the subject of the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>620</span>
There have been weeks of discussion and action in the county and in the City of Sheffield regarding the Minister's decision. Never in my 12½ years as Member of Parliament for the area have I received so many letters, been asked to address so many public meetings or been interviewed by so many people. I am pleased to say that the argument has at all times remained above parish-pump level and have been non-party—a point which I shall develop later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Derbyshire County Council and the Dronfield Urban District Council which are Conservative-controlled, and the Labour-controlled Chesterfield R.D.C. and Eckington and Killamarsh Parish Councils have worked hand-in-hand to try to prevent their parishes or districts being included in South Yorkshire. There are many reasons for this, and every argument put forward by their representatives, even as late as 10 o'clock last night in Sheffield Town Hall, has been most reasoned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday—I am dealing with the last meeting first because it was so significant—a meeting took place in Sheffield Town Hall, jointly convened by the Conservative-controlled Derbyshire County Council and the Labour-controlled Sheffield City Council. It was a lengthy, exciting, and serious discussion and took place on a friendly basis. As late as yesterday, the leader of the Sheffield City Council, Alderman Sir Ron Ironmonger, was saying that he felt, and that the City Council felt, that there was no case for the inclusion of the two parishes and the urban district in the South Yorkshire metropolitan district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The urban district of Dronfield has a population of 16,000, nearly 50 per cent. of whom work in Sheffield. Last Monday night I addressed a meeting in Dronfield, convened on a non-party basis, attended by 300 people. No more could get into the room and a number had to be turned away. After two-and-a-half hours a motion was put defending the right of Dronfield to stay in the new county of Derbyshire. The Council and everybody in Dronfield have been made aware during the past weeks that, whatever happens in the future, whether they are in South Yorkshire or in North Derbyshire, their urban district as such, within the context
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0342">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>621</span>
of the old local government law, will inevitably change, and there will be a new framework of local government in Dronfield. Much to my surprise and delight, the people of Dronfield accepted that line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the platform at that meeting were the Conservative Chairman of Dronfield Urban District Council, the Conservative Chairman of the Derbyshire County Council, the headmaster of the comprehensive school in Dronfield, my hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Varley) and myself—a non-party platform at a very important meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the meeting only nine people voted in favour of Dronfield's being included in the South Yorkshire metropolitan district. Their leader—they apparently came all together to the meeting—said that the main reason for being taken over by the South Yorkshire metropolitan district was that he did not get his dustbins emptied often enough. He added that the nearest bus station was 200 yards away from his house and that although he had a car, in the event of its breaking down, he would have to walk 200 yards to catch the bus. I congratulated him on the magnitude of his case, the explicit way in which he put it and the importance of its content. That appeared to be the strength of the opposition to staying in the new county of Derbyshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dronfield is almost unanimous. We have taken a cross-section of opinion in the town on a non-political basis, and the results show that about 94 per cent. of Dronfield people wish to remain in the new county of Derbyshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Killamarsh and Eckington are parishes within the Chesterfield Rural District Council, and some way from Dronfield. Nevertheless, the same enthusiasm has been displayed in both parishes. A referendum was held in Killamarsh and the results, on a poll of over 70 per cent.—in extraordinarily high poll in these days—was that 92 per cent. wished to remain in the new county and only eight per cent. wished to go into the South Yorkshire metropolitan district. A number of public meetings have been held in the parish of Killamarsh and the views expressed have been almost unanimously in favour of staying in the county of Derbyshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between Killamarsh, the first village in Derbyshire, and Halfway, the first village in post-1967 Yorkshire, there is a vast
	<span class='label label-info column'>622</span>
area of washland, through the middle of which runs the River Rother. The wash-land is made up of silt and industrial waste, and the whole area, which is about six miles long and ¾ mile wide, is extremely boggy, which would prevent for all time any continuous development between the City of Sheffield, which would be in District (c) of the South Yorkshire metropolitan district, and Killamarsh itself. Using the criteria laid down, there would be no responsibility of continuous development between this parish and the South Yorkshire metropolitan district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Killamarsh are convinced that they have a good case, supported by thousands of people outside the parish, for the retention of their parish within the new county of Derbyshire. At the public meetings I have taken the trouble to tell them, in no uncertain terms, that whatever the framework when the Bill becomes law, their structure of local government will inevitably be changed one way or the other. They are convinced that they would rather remain in Derbyshire, with a structure of local government within the new county of Derbyshire, than become part of the new South Yorkshire area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a natural barrier between Yorkshire and Derbyshire—the Moss brook. There is an area of green land, known locally as the green belt, and the intention is to prevent any development towards Eckington on that land. Any possibility of continuous development between Eckington and the new South Yorkshire metropolitan area is remote, to say the least. The valley between the steep hill which comes down from Mosbrough and the steep hill descending from Eckington—one of the lesser known beautiful valleys in Derbyshire, the Moss Vale—forms a natural barrier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Eckington have expressed their opinion by referendum and 90 per cent. of them are determined to remain in Derbyshire. I have here a letter from people who I know do not support me personally or politically. I shall not weary the Committee with contents, but we are asked to do everything that we can to prevent Eckington from being included in South Yorkshire. The letter is from the North-East Derbyshire Conservative Association, an association which would try to bring back hanging if it could name me as the first victim, and I can claim no close
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0343">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>623</span>
friendship with the writers. However, those who signed the letter have joined me on a platform, have spoken with the same interest and vigour, have made out the same case, and we have patted one another on the back because we all believe that Eckington should remain in the county of Derbyshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that as a result of their and my actions many conservatives in North-East Derbyshire will vote for me at the next Election. There is a question mark to that, but the North-East Derbyshire Conservative Association is, nevertheless, 100 per cent. behind us. About 50 per cent. of their members, and about 50 per cent. of the other parishioners in the village, including Labour Party members, have formed a parishioners' committee, and they have done a tremendous job of work in the village in advancing this cause. I never thought to see the day when Labour and Conservative Party officials would be riding through the village together on a decorated float bearing the notice "Keep Eckington in Derbyshire".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to say that in North-East Derbyshire this is not a question of politics. I have insisted that I would not attend any meeting in the county on this subject if it was organised by one or other of the two main political parties. I have tried to keep the issue strictly on nonparty lines, on behalf of every resident of those villages which I represent. I, unlike many hon. Gentlemen opposite, have always been proud to make my representations on behalf of Conservatives as well as of Labour people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ours is an extremely strong case, supported by the controlling council at Sheffield which has made no major representations to the Minister at any time during the negotiations. Hon. Members who attended the meeting at Sheffield some weeks ago were impressed by the representations made at that meeting by the Derbyshire County Council, the Chesterfield Rural District Council and the parishes. At that meeting the City of Sheffield was represented, and quite rightly so, and its representatives were as impressed with the case made out by the parishes of Derbyshire as was the Minister himself. As a consequence, when Barlborough, which was excluded from the plan at the last stage, held a celebration and lit bonfires to celebrate staying
	<span class='label label-info column'>624</span>
in the County of Derbyshire, Sir Ron Ironmonger, the leader of the Sheffield City Council, who was the guest of honour, said, according to the local Press:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sir Ron admitted today that Dronfield had become 'almost a dormitory of the city', but said he 'wouldn't lose any sleep over it' if the town remained in Derbyshire.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>So far as Killamarsh and Eckington were concerned there were more 'cons' than 'pros' to Sheffield taking these areas over.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>He explained: 'Anybody who has been there recently will see that there would obviously be a fairly heavy burden on the city with regard to development, expansion and capital investment.'</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Alderman Bill Trippett, chairman of Derbyshire County Council, is to get in touch with Sir Ron immediately about the offer."</p></blockquote>
The City Council at Sheffield has therefore agreed that there is. no necessity for those parishes and that urban district to be included in the county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 	<i>Morning Telegraph</i> of 13th December, 1971, it was reported:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'The outcome of Barlborough's struggle was a victory for democracy', said Sir Ron. 'Eckington and Killamarsh don't want to be part of a South Yorkshire Metropolitan Area, either, and there is no reason why they should,' he added. 'If Derbyshire County Council gets its finger out and seeks quick talks with Sheffield there is not much doubt we could present a united front to the Government on the desirability of keeping the two parishes in Derbyshire.'</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>He added last night: 'I understand there is complete unity within the county on this matter, and I am pretty positive that my people would be amenable.'"</p></blockquote>
There are no differences between the two areas most immediately involved, that is the City of Sheffield, which will form the district, and the rural district and the parishes concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not take much longer. There is a lot of business to get through, and we should be making progress. Because unity between the local authorities on both sides, the non-political structure of the argument right from the outset to as late as last night, the convincing case made out in the presence of the Minister, the convincing case that has been made out at all levels in the county, and, above all, because the wishes and the will of the people have been expressed by referendum, the Minister should accept these Amendments. Paragraph 31 of the White Paper refers to local democracy. We have exercised local democracy to its fullest extent in these areas, and as a consequence we have the pulse of the feeling
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0344">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>625</span>
at all levels of the people whom we represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in Parliament, and my friends in the lower strata of government down from the county to the parishes, believe that we have tested local feeling through the exercise of local democracy, and we are convinced that our case is good. I hope and trust that the Minister will see fit to accept the Amendment so that the people of Derbyshire can go forward with their new structure of local government and make a great success of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose at this stage to refer to the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Goole (Mr. Fox). I had hoped that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) would deal with these Amendments, but the Committee will be sorry to hear that he is indisposed. I shall therefore listen to what the Minister has to say and perhaps deal with them later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to and support the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) who, in a high-minded and eloquent speech—we always expect him to be high-minded and eloquent, and he certainly lived up to expectations—put his case as forcefully as it could possibly be put. His voice barely trembled when he mentioned the alliance with the North-East Derbyshire Conservatives, but I noticed a considerable whiteness around his knuckles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case is a strong one. It is the case on behalf of an urban district council, as it now is, and two rural district councils which, on the present proposals, form the southern flank of South Yorkshire, or, as my hon. Friend would like it, the northern flank of Derbyshire. The population of about 39,000—my hon. Friend says that it is 32,000, but in any event it is large—have a remarkable unanimity of view. The major political parties agree about what should be done and, as my hon. Friend said, the inhabitants of those areas share their view. It is impressive that 90 per cent. of those who voted—I think the Minister will accept that these were high polls—opted to stay in Derbyshire. That is a large, and I should have thought decisive, poll, and if paragraphs 29 and 32 of the White Paper are to mean anything—they say that where possible local opinion will be consulted and implemented—surely they should be applied in this instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>626</span>
Sheffield has always presented a difficulty, and I was relieved to hear what my hon. Friend said about the views of the people of Sheffield. They have made the situation clearer, and I should have thought that they have made it much easier for the Minister to be his usual graceful self and accept another set of Opposition Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had one doubt when the matter was first put to me. It was on a point of principle which seemed to militate against my hon. Friend's argument. It was whether, if we removed these three areas from the metropolitan county of South Yorkshire, we would draw the boundaries of that county too tightly. This is a point of view which I know the Minister does not share. At first sight it appeared to me to be an argument against my hon. Friend, but I have gone into the matter and it appears to me that this is rather a different case
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1967 Sheffield took over about 5,000 acres of North-East Derbyshire for its overspill programme. I should have thought that that would give Sheffield all the leeway that it wanted. Five thousand acres is a large area, and I should have thought that it would give Sheffield a more flexible boundary than one finds in other areas. Having been told by my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East that Sheffield has no more territorial ambitions in Derbyshire, the doubt in my mind has been reasonably satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was impressed by the close arguments used by my hon. Friend about the natural boundaries between what he sees as Derbyshire and South Yorkshire. These are effective, natural boundaries, and it would be of advantage to use them as the boundary between the two counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Second Reading debate on 17th November the Minister said that he would welcome further debate on this matter in Committee. At that time he was not 100 per cent. certain that the inclusion of Dronfield, Eckington and Killamarsh in South Yorkshire was necessarily the last word. Presumably he has been thinking it over during the intervening period, and I hope that he will be prepared to make some concessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, let us consider the question of communities. Here is a population of 32,000, or 39,000—at any rate a population of more than 30,000—in contiguous areas and having an obvious community of interests, in that they regard themselves as Derbyshire men. When they were offered the choice, which the hon. and proud
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>627</span>
Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox) boasted of earlier, of becoming Yorkshiremen, they turned that down. There is obviously a strong Derbyshire community of interest here. There is clearly a community of planning here. The natural boundary which flows between Derbyshire and Yorkshire guarantees that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons I hope that the Minister will accept our proposals. It is in no spirit of trying to make a deal, or a bargain with a political enemy, that I promise him that should there be a Division on Amendment 158, we shall support him. We shall do that merely in order to point out the high-minded, impartial, dispassionate views which motivate us on this side of the Committee, and which we hope will, in turn, motivate him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very brief. At the risk of embarrassing the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain), I should like to add my plea to his. I hope the Minister will accept our case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have happy memories of that part of Derbyshire. I once contested a neighbouring constituency to the hon. Gentleman's. I made many friends there, and I have had innumerable letters from people who know me and know that I am on this Committee asking me to support their case at the appropriate moment. The case has been more than eloquently made out by the hon. Gentleman and from my personal knowledge I am pleased to endorse everything that he said. I sincerely hope that the Minister will accept this extremely sensible Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Morrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to add a few words in support of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain). On the whole, I am strongly opposed to the reduction of the areas of the metropolitan counties, and it is a pity that already the Government have reduced some of the areas proposed in the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, and having dealt briefly with the general principles, I think that we have to compare the arguments which have been put forward in relation to north-east Derbyshire with the views that have been expressed by the Minister in relation to Harrogate. If my hon. Friend is prepared to give way on Harrogate, presumably as a result of pressure from that town, and remembering also that Harrogate is part of Yorkshire and that under the proposals set out in the White
	<span class='label label-info column'>628</span>
Paper it would remain part of Yorkshire, surely there are close ties between Harrogate and the new South Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister prepared to accept that? It seems most unfair that a part of North-East Derbyshire's emotional attachment to its existing county should be destroyed by the proposals contained in the Bill. I hope that the Minister will pay as much attention to the ties which this part of Derbyshire has with the existing county as apparently he has paid to the ties which Harrogate has with Yorkshire as it now exists, rather than with the existing County Borough of Sheffield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was very sorry to hear of the indisposition of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell). I hope that the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) will take our sympathy to him. I also have to apologise on behalf of my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, who has been told by his doctor to stay at home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to see the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) back with us after an illness and in such good form this morning. May I leave the hon. Gentleman's argument until a little later and deal with the debate in the order in which it came.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall) said that the parish of Sykehouse should move from South Yorkshire to the area which will now be known as Humber-side. During the consultations on the White Paper, Sykehouse and the adjoining parish of Fishlake asked to be put in what was then East Yorkshire, but Thorne and the Thorne rural district, of which they are part, accepted its position within South Yorkshire. It is difficult to take an intervening parish, such as Sykehouse, out of the conurbation. Looking at the map, Sykehouse is so clearly connected with the south, Stainforth with the east and Thorne, and Adwick Le Street to the west and Askern, that one really ought to leave it where it is, at any rate for the purpose of the Bill. I cannot say that I am satisfied that there should be any move there. But it is still open, in cases such as this, for a district at a later date to apply to the Boundary Commission for an adjustment. However, I am not convinced that that should be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next case the hon. Gentleman mentioned was Finningley, where Finningley airfield is divided by the boundary which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0346">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>629</span>
we have proposed. Looking at the map, Finningley does perhaps jut out into the neighbouring county. Doncaster Rural District Council have informed me that at present this does not provide any real difficulty to them, but they did ask that the change be made in the Bill, in the hope that we might get the boundaries settled. I was a little disturbed by what the hon. Gentleman said about local feeling, but, looking at the map and the developments and the airfield, I am torn between leaving this to the Boundary Commission or correcting it in the Bill. I think it could be corrected in the Bill, and that we should make the Amendment now. It is a very small area. There is no community of interest there. Looking at the village of Finningley, cheek by jowl with the village of Blaxton, it seemed that they should go together. I am inclined to advise the Committee to accept the hon. Gentleman's Amendment in the case of Finningley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the hamlet of Hesley—I know the Committee does not wish me to go through the arguments as to why we drew the line where it is—I accept the arguments put forward by the hon. Gentleman. I think we should make the Amendment which he seeks. I have informed the hon. Gentleman that the wording of his Amendment is not satisfactory to me and I believe, Sir Stephen, that he intends to submit some wording, if you would accept it as a manuscript Amendment, which is satisfactory to me. There was a similar Amendment, Amendment No. 398, which asked for another line to be drawn in that district which I could not understand, and I reject that. However, I hope he will appreciate the acceptance of the Amendment concerning the hamlet of Hesley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the parishes of Dronfield, Eckington and Killamarsh to the south of Sheffield. Killamarsh is divided from Sheffield by the filthiest valley I have seen for a long time. If it were joined with Sheffield one might have hoped that that valley would have been cleaned up. Eckington, again, is almost part of Sheffield. It is a commuter area. When Sheffield is fully built up in the Mosbrough area it will come up to the boundary of Eckington. Dronfield, whatever independent economic life it had when the local coal mines were open, is now a dependency of Sheffield, completely a commuter
	<span class='label label-info column'>630</span>
village of Sheffield, and only separated by five fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have put forward the arguments which weighed with us in drawing the line south of those villages. In the Circular announcing the Bill we included the village of Barlborough to the east. We had the whole run of these villages, Barlborough, Killamarsh, Eckington and Dronfield, included within the conurbation. When one studies that, Barlborough, which is on the other side of the main road, seemed an obvious candidate for removal from the conurbation. It was a village on its own, keen still to be within Derbyshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moving to the west, we come next to Killamarsh. Killamarsh is a village which is separated by a valley. My main concern in including Killamarsh with Sheffield was that we might get the valley cleaned up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only reason why the valley has been left derelict has been the uncertainty about the question where the boundaries are to be drawn. That has been the Derbyshire County Council's difficulty. One side of the River Rother is in Yorkshire, with 50 per cent. of the washland, and the other 50 per cent. is in the existing County of Derbyshire. Talks have begun at local level with a view to creating a situation whereby the valley can be improved. Tremendous capital expenditure will be needed for improvement, but the local authorities are determined to improve it in the not too distant future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I accept the Amendment of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East, take Killamarsh out of the conurbation, and leave it in Derbyshire, as I intend to do, I hope I shall be rewarded by the authorities getting together and cleaning up that valley. It is a terrible sight, and, as Sheffield develops towards, it will be ghastly for the residents to have to look into that valley. That also applies to Killamarsh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moving again to the west, one reaches the more open area of Eckington. Sheffield, as has been pointed out, has recently had an extension of its boundaries to the south, acquiring some 5,000 acres of Mosbrough for development for residential purposes. Sheffield has hardly started to develop that, and there are wide open spaces for development. Having so recently given Sheffield that area, one must look
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0347">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>631</span>
seriously at the boundary thus set, and see whether it should be held at that point. The terrain there, which gives Eckington a high ridge, is an area where I would have thought no one would dream of permitting development, in order to keep it as a lung for south Sheffield. I can see no good reason, in face of local feeling, why it should then be kept within Sheffield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I comment on the charm of the people of Eckington on the two occasions when I met them, in their own area, and outside at a meeting in Sheffield. If I have been swayed by anything, perhaps it is their charm. I do not mean to derogate from the advocacy of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East. One is always swayed by his charm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having given way that far, and said that for these villages to the south, Killamarsh and Eckington, there is no reason why the people should not have what they want and be kept in Derbyshire, one comes to the more difficult area, Dronfield. Dronfield is what I would call a patriotic commuter village. They do commute; they do work in Sheffield, yet they are deeply patriotic about their own residential area where they live. In the same way as no one would dream of developing the Eckington area, no one would dream of enlarging Dronfield. It is already built up, and forms a separate community on its own. As the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East has said, Dronfield is passionately keen on keeping out of the conurbation and remaining in North-East Derbyshire.

Having gone as far as to leave out the other three villages—Barlborough, Killamarsh and Eckington—I can hardly strain at the fourth, and not include it. I shall be drawing the line north of Dronfield in accordance with the suggestion in the Amendments. I must make one distinction. These villages are not to be compared to the string of towns to the north of West Yorkshire—the Ilkley to Wetherby towns. These are villages which are close to and dependent on Sheffield, but no one would wish Sheffield to develop into them. The only justification for including them in a conurbation would be that we had also included Chesterfield, when they could be put as a district with something further to the south. As it stands, it would be right, and I would advise the Committee to accept the

	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The proposition is for an additional metropolitan authority, and neither I nor other hon. Members of the Committee are unaware of the implication that to propose a new metropolitan authority, additional to those already proposed, is a serious matter. Lest eyebrows be raised, and questions posed at the population and viability of the authority that I am proposing, it would be helpful at the outset to consider both Tyneside and the West Riding-North Derbyshire authority 	<i>vis-à-vis</i> the one that I am proposing and consider some facts and figures. Then one could immediately indicate that this is a viable proposition, because so far as Amendment No. 426 is concerned, I understand that an authority such as I propose would have a population of approximately 1,157,000, and a rateable value of about £54 million, with a rateable
	<span class='label label-info column'>634</span>
value per head, if my calculations are correct, of about £46.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither Tyneside nor the West Yorkshire authorities, as proposed by the Government, could match those figures so far as rateable values are concerned. In terms of population, both of the Government's proposed authorities exceed the Thameside authority that I am proposing by about 150,000 people in each area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that anyone here would deny the growing importance of Thameside in relation to the country's economic situation. I am very much aware of this, rather ruefully, in so far as its effect is likely to be on my own country's economic situation, that is to say, Wales—a country, not a county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strategic plan for the South-East must also be considered, as well as the plans recently announced for an airport at Foulness and, allied to it, the seaport at Maplin, with the allied industrial sites. Currently, the population of the authority that I propose would be about 1,150,000—that is a 1970 figure. But it is reliably forecast that in about 25 years' time, this population will almost certainly be doubled. That is a large factor in the proposition before the Committee. I think that this great increase in population is certain if Foulness, the seaport and the industrial complex go ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who has any faint knowledge of the Thameside communities would agree that they face some enormous problems, particularly environmental problems. I should like to think that no local government propositions for the generation ahead would ignore the environmental blight which many areas of our country suffer, and in particular the Thameside communities. I am thinking of the ravages—and they are ravages—of the chalk extraction, of the clay mining, and of the extraction of ballast. Think of the persistent refuse tipping in large quantities; in some places cement dust is always present, and, something that Thameside is learning to live with, the ever-present threat of inundation of these communities by the Thames.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On either side of this river, there is the oil industry, with its refining and storage. There are attendant risks there as well, if only because there are malodorous results consequent upon that industry. Again, although I will not labour the point, no one is unaware of the great traffic and commuter problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that these are factors which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>635</span>
unite the north and south of Thameside. They are problems common to both, and whilst physically—maybe only temporarily—the Thames divides, in every other way there is a unity. On the flooding issue, for example, in support of my argument, I would pose the fact that some communities have expressed to me a fear that if the current propositions by the Government go ahead, one side of the river might tackle its flooding problems or the threat of flooding, whilst the other side would not. This would not only be unjust, possibly disastrous, but it would not fit in with the concept, which I hope the Government accept, of good and sensible planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible—and I do not wish to be unnecessarily provocative—that the rumps, if I may so call them, of Essex and Kent—on reflection, I would like to choose a better phrase than that but I cannot immediately think of one—would control the future of the Thameside communities, which are basically alien and opposed in outlook to what would remain of these two counties. As I see it, the Amendment in my name and that of my hon. Friends does propose a community of interest both now and for the future. I am a little worried about the current situation, whether or not things will be left as they are, or whether a great environmental clean-up can be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a great Thameside authority were created, I think it would have the will and the inspiration to tackle some of the appalling problems that are attendant on Thameside today. But if things are left as the Government propose, I do not think that the mess will be tackled, because we would have North Thames and South Thames controlled by the two rurally-orientated counties of Essex and Kent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is to the future that I look principally, in seeking to gain the support of the Committee for this Amendment. It is a case for looking to the future and testing the viability of the authority proposed in the Amendment. I do not think that it is beyond the bounds of possibility that by the end of the century, if not before, Thameside population will double. There is already a tremendous build-up in southern Essex. Ten miles from Southend, round Basildon, there is almost a new town situation, and when the Foulness development goes ahead, there will be a great need for housing, transport integra-
	<span class='label label-info column'>636</span>
tion and planning. While this great mechanical adventure on the marshes, mudflats and Sands takes place, the workers in their thousands, I presume, will commute from places like Basildon and other townships on Thameside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know, too, that very ambitious plans are being advocated—and, I think, realistic plans in the main—for the Maplin Sands. At this point, therefore, I would like to quote briefly from a report of an open meeting, addressed by Mr. Ordman, Assistant Director-General of the P.L.A., on 9th December, 1971. What Mr. Ordman said has, I think, distinct relevance for Thameside and very largely goes along with the proposition that I have made in the Amendment. Mr. Ordman emphasised that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the prosperity of the south-eastern region was linked to the Port of London. There had been a revolution in the size of ships from 16½ thousand tons in 1945 to 200,000 in 1970, drawing 67-ft: 500,000-ton ships drawing 80-ft. were already envisaged with a possible maximum of 1 million tons, drawing 120-ft."</p></blockquote>
The point here is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Maplin Sands are situated next to relatively deep water and is better situated than Rotterdam for large ships because of the configuration of the sea bed. Very large ships passing to Rotterdam will still have to come within 20 miles of the Thames. There is a limit of 48-ft. on the existing Thames but Maplin could take a ¼ million ton ship with a 67-ft. draught, progressing to ships with ½ million tons with an 80-ft. draught over the next 20-30 years."</p></blockquote>
I think that this has significance.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Ships could not get up bigger than this because of the limit imposed by the English Channel."</p></blockquote>
Then there is containerisation. This has meant that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the industry has become capital intensive as opposed to labour-intensive, and also needs much more land immediately behind the berths together with good road and rail links. These factors together with the size of ships means that the Port must move away from London. More containers are handled at Tilbury than by any other port in Britain, and one berth at Tilbury handles more than any other berth in Europe. Competition from European ports is forcing the P.L.A. quickly to Maplin Sands. It is felt that the Maplin area would be used for oil storage, general cargo and timber and possibly as an iron ore terminal. There would be a certain area for allied industries. Oil would be pumped from Maplin to the refineries along Thameside on both sides of the estuary. If Maplin became a terminal for high grade iron ore an ideal situation for the major steel works in Europe would be on the Medway.".</p></blockquote>
I should declare here an interest in steelworks. Mine is a steel constituency. Thus I am not in 100 per cent. agreement
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>637</span>
with Mr. Ordman in this respect, very largely because I cannot imagine how, although one may construct a steelworks on those mudflats, one could persuade thousands of men to go there, when there is no historic interest or skill in steel. However, that is a passing reference, which I make out of loyalty to my constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Note continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The estuary should not be a divisive influence but should be cohesive with plenty of crossings. Mr. Ordman would like to see the Maplin Port in operation within the next decade and, indeed, the first containers there in 1977. Maplin would not be a competitor for Tilbury as it would serve the remainder of the country whilst Tilbury would be the port for London and predominant at least for the next 10-15 years."</p></blockquote>
These remarks by a very skilled and able man, the Assistant Director-General of the P.L.A., lends considerable weight to the propositions which I am making today. However, I have not yet touched upon the impetus, or likely effect, of the Foulness Airport. I believe that that might well stimulate something on the lines of a new linear city, requiring tremendous transport planning and foresight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regrettably, it appears likely that we are to join the Common Market. However, I do not wish to enter upon an argument on the Common Market, although the issue may certainly touch upon the Amendment in the years ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that Thameside will grow in economic importance. Someone whom I greatly respect has said that the Channel Tunnel is not a reality; it is still a dream. That is true, yet it is perhaps approaching that state where the dream almost becomes reality. Discussions are already taking place concerning further crossings of the Thames and for an extra bridge in the generation ahead. That fact should be taken into account by the Committee when deciding the fate of the Amendment. My own constituency is likely to witness a barrage across the Dee. A barrage across the estuary on Thameside is not an impossibility, and it would certainly radically change any concept which the Government may so far have of local government reorganisation a generation ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No large authority should be brought into being under the re-organised local government scheme unless it has the means, the will and the inspiration to
	<span class='label label-info column'>638</span>
tackle environmental blight and the dreadful sociological and economic problems which follow therefrom. I have explained to the Committee my fear that, with regard to the Government proposals. Essex and Kent as they are planned may be unable to look after the very fine, well-established communities on either side of the river, where reclamation is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of reclamation will he necessary as far as the clay workings are concerned. With determination and coordination from both sides of the river, there is a great deal of reclamation of land which could be used either for almost an arable purpose, or certainly for the development of minor industries. Mudflats in the marshes are a further challenge to the likely local authorities in the reorganised system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus I should like continually to re-emphasise my contention that the proposals are not good enough, so far as the will to alter the environment on either side of the river is concerned. For those reasons, I hope the Committee will give careful attention to the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to support my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East (Mr. Barry Jones). I shall try not to go over the same ground which he has covered, but to put one or two additional points to the Minister for his consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the point concerning easier navigation around the Maplin Sands because of the deep water channels would be much better appreciated if we had access to Sheet 162 of the one-inch ordnance series. I have been able to exhume Sheet 172, which shows the southern bank of the estuary, but I have been unable to find Sheet 162. This is a disadvantage. While not holding the Minister responsible, à 	<i>propos</i> the various remarks which have been made concerning maps, I notice that he has the assistance of a very substantial magnifying glass. I do not know whether this is what we used to refer to as "pusser's issue". If so, I should be grateful if he would funnel a few across to this side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is entirely a personal acquisition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister

	<span class='label label-info column'>639</span>
on that highly commendable example of private enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say, because I represent a Bristol constituency, which is far and away the largest urban area in this country to be put into a district. It is interesting to consider the history of the Thames estuary. Without wishing to open up any of the sores which were exposed a few months ago when the question of the Common Market arose, and if my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. S. C. Silkin) will brace himself, I would point out that only 20,000 years ago Britain was actually physically joined to the Continent of Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Continent of Europe was joined to Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And in those days the Welsh occupied England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept with alacrity the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford. However, I am not keen to pursue the second point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Thames at the time, when the sea gradually rose, had been a tributary of an enormous river which flowed into what is now the North Sea. It was a great, marshy, forested area, virtually uninhabited. Hon. Members will know that prehistoric man lived on the chalk downs and on the gravel terraces of the Thames. Indeed, it was at Swanscombe—one of the districts mentioned in the Amendment—where a very vital clue to man's development in Britain—the Swanscombe skull—was found. This area, far from being an area avoided by man, has now become a magnet. Thus I think we should consider the Amendment in the context of the orientation towards Europe which is bound to take place in the event of our entry into the European Community
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend, in moving the Amendment, mentioned a large steelworks. Hon. Members will know that there is already at Dagenham a very large motor company which has a steelworks attached to it. The Ford Motor Company before the war was looking for a site for a large factory. The choice was narrowed down to two sites—the other being the Forest of Dean, where there was access to coal supplies for the Thames Estuary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the final analysis the thing which decided them on the Thames Estuary was
	<span class='label label-info column'>640</span>
not simply the ease of access to deep water but also the orientation towards Europe and the ease of export towards the industrial countries of Western Europe. Even before the war this was an important factor and was the first example of a car industry being located for economic reasons rather than for a personal quirk, as at Oxford, or because of a long history of skills, as in the Midlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is now a very great community of interest between the north and south banks, which will grow. The estuary should be looked upon as a uniting rather than a divisive factor. The Severn Estuary—which is in my own area—was for a very long time a great uniting trade route between South Wales and the North Devon and Somerset coasts. Only recently has it declined. In fact, there was more community of interest between the two banks than between the hinterlands. It is not simply a question whether there is physical access between one bank and another; it is a psychological matter, concerned with the way in which people think in relation to the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members know well that a whole series of industries—paper, cement and oil, which my hon. Friend mentioned—were founded on local resources or the advantage of ease of access. There are also a number of seaside resorts, and there is a great similarity of development between the north and south banks. On the southern side of the estuary the North Downs form a natural ring to the area—it is a saucer-shaped basin—and within this ring linear development has occurred on both sides of the estuary. In fact, the routes are oriented from west to east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The weald of Kent and Sussex has been a classic geological and geographical section, sliced from north to south, showing the difference in land use as one moves from north to south. There is far more identity of interest between the north and south banks than between the coastal areas and their hinterlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will very briefly emphasise the purpose of local government reform. It seems to me that in trying to reform local government we should not simply try to patch up the deficiencies which have appeared as a result of long usage of the system; rather, we should be looking ahead. If we consider the move downstream of industry and shipping facilities—the shift of the centre of gravity, and the need for a counter-balance to the very large London
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>641</span>
authority—we see that it is common sense to have on both sides of the Thames one large authority which can be responsible for overall planning, because this is the area in which tremendous expansion is expected. If we are to get a thorough grasp on the real fears of the regions that the South-East will develop at their expense, it is important to have overall planning on both banks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the South-East will develop very substantially. It would be a great pity if there were not complete co-ordination between the development both to the north and the south.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following my hon. Friend's thesis that water does not divide. Nevertheless, will he not come up against a major obstacle if he says that the Thames or the Severn does not divide? On either side there are land masses which obviously will unite. Is not the question of sheer size important? I know that sheer size does not daunt him, of all people—I am speaking as one of his colleagues—but where does he stop on either bank? How far does he go? Will he be kind enough to give us some indication as to how far he would go north or south of the Thames, or east or west of the Severn, or perhaps even north and south of the Humber? I do not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to irry hon Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson). I will not take up his point about the Severn, because I took care to say that in the past it has certainly been a great unifying influence. But with regard to the area which is the subject of the Amendment, if he cares to shade in the local authorities mentioned in the Amendment, as I have done, and crudely to tear a piece out so that we get a mesh, I think that he will see that there is a fairly compact unit, in which there is an identity of interest. If I had to delineate the border to the south I would say that there is the dip slope of the chalk. Leading up to the scarp base it is in itself something of a natural boundary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So it is due not to a geological division but a division based upon watersheds. In talking about dip slopes of chalk my hon. Friend is talking in purely physical terms. I would have thought that in local government divisions one spoke about people, and the human side—about how people unite, and their
	<span class='label label-info column'>642</span>
economic activities, and how they coordinate their day-by-day work, and things of that nature. It is a little backward to start talking about the geology because people often go abroad on holiday—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I would say that to the South there is a clear physical boundary. I cannot be quite so clear about the North, because I have not the sheet to which I made reference.

I ask the Committee and the Minister to think very seriously about this Amendment, and whether or not we should be thinking in terms of future developments and how best we can control them, in. the interests of the people not only in the area but in the other parts of the country, who will be in considerable trouble if all this projected growth takes place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Flint, East about the inevitability of our joining the Common Market. It is not as inevitable as a Thameside authority, and I think it just as undesirable. These proposals incorporate all the districts of my constituency, and I must explain my interest in this matter.
