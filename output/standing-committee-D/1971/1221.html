	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soref</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that owing to an unavoidable constituency engagement last Thursday, I was not able to be present at the sitting of this Committee. I should like to place on record to the people of Ormskirk that the Amendment in the names of the hon. Member for Widnes and his hon. Friends would be an intolerable contravention of their wishes. I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary had the good sense to turn down this proposal. The Amendment's rejection has given great satisfaction to members of all political parties in the Ormskirk division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I missed the latter half of the Under-Secretary's speech last Thursday, but I have read it with interest. In many ways, it confirms my view of the Bill. In the first part of what I shall
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>551</span>
say it is a small mirror of the Bill. Nowhere is there a principle involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his speech the Under-Secretary dealt with a number of individual points and questions, those of Blackpool and Preston. They are important points, and I concede that they had to be dealt with. Although I disagree with the hon. Gentleman about the effect of his proposals, he is free to make those points, and he made them fairly. However, I am bound to say that no point of principle, no logic, and no thread of consistency ran through his speech when he considered the general principles, because he scarcely considered them at all. The hon. Gentleman's speech was a thing of rags and shreds, interspersed with a few party political points of doubtful relevance and of even more doubtful taste. He did not give us a real view of the whole situation. He has not met the most important point that can be made on this series of Amendments, which is that this proposed group of four metropolitan district councils is bound together by a community of interest, planning and transportation, and bound together by wishing to be a larger metropolitan county. I cannot conceive it to be possible to make a fair speech on this subject without giving weight to these desires and opinions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Under-Secretary this far: there is a difficulty about the proposed 	<i>District</i> (	<i>e</i>). It is a relatively small population. I can appreciate that nobody knows when the central Lancashire new town is likely to evolve, when building will start, and what its effect will be. It is true that it may be over many years. But we must take a balanced view. Here are four districts which, were they joined by a fifth of reasonable population, would make an obvious metropolitan county. The snag is the fifth district, which has the low population of 123.000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary says that, if he made that into a metropolitan district council, all the other areas of 123,000 would come to him and say that they wanted to be made metropolitan districts, too. That argument will apply to whatever is the lowest population of metropolitan district council. The Under-Secretary talks of West Yorkshire with a metropolitan district council of 177,000. He says that that is exceptional. He will have to make that case to every area with a population of 177,000 or over to which he has not
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>
given the status. So he might just as well do it on this, because this is a balance. The balance is between what looks like, feels like and historically ought to be, a composite group, a metropolitan county, and what is marred by that effect, namely, the one sore thumb. But that one sore thumb has a reasonably large population and a growing one. The effect of the new town must indisputably and inevitably create a much larger population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Michael Heseltine)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help the right hon. Gentleman to point out that the new town is not actually in the weaker district.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with that. I am talking about the effect of the population. The area must be considered as a whole. This is exacdy my complaint about the Under-Secretary. He is considering it, not as a whole, but district by district.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully appreciate this argument. But why, when the right hon. Gentleman was in a position to support a Government who put forward proposals, did they divide it into individual unitary authorities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We never in fact introduced a Bill. We produced a White Paper. The Government also have had a White Paper and, if I am not mistaken, have occasionally in very important points of principle deviated from it. So might we have done. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] The Under-Secretary ought to laugh from a standing position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether I stand or sit, the paucity of the right hon. Gentleman's argument will be no better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is consistent with the Under-Secretary's attitude. He is leading me off the main thread of argument, but let us at least kill this particular dog while we can. The Government's White Paper and the Bill are two very different things. The hon. Gentleman knows that. The Secretary of State said that this would be so at the time, and that the Government would listen. The difference between a White Paper and a Bill is something which most hon. Members understand. The fact that the Labour Government introduced a White Paper but never introduced a Bill is totally irrelevant. We are not dealing with legislation which was never brought forward. If a Bill had been intro-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>553</span>
duced by the Labour Government, the hon. Gentleman, then in opposition, might very well have persuaded the Labour Government to change their minds and to make central Lancashire into a metropolitan county. That is precisely what I am asking him to do today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a long debate on this point. The Government have proved totally inflexible for the moment but, on second thoughts, might be more flexible. It is a matter which I hope will be aired more fully on Report, when other Lancashire Members of Parliament can have their say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall put what seems to me the major point in this series of Amendments. My hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) is modest and kind, and I am sure that he will agree with me that his Amendment is not as far-reaching as the Amendments in my name and in the names of certain of my hon. Friends; so perhaps it is more
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
appropriate for me to open on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the new County of Merseyside, the obvious factor, geographically and historically, is to include the whole Wirral peninsula. It is a composite whole and it is a unit. It is an area that sticks out, bounded by the Dee Estuary—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the right hon. Gentleman help me by indicating to which Amendment his name is attached? I cannot see his name on any Amendment, but perhaps this is a briefing error. I should be most grateful to have that information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I help? It does not matter in the slightest whether the right hon. Gentleman's name is attached to the Amendment or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, but it does help to know what the right hon. Gentleman is talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that will emerge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was proposing to talk about Ellesmere Port and Neston. I myself get lost with the Amendments on the Paper as it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Wirral is bounded by the Estuary of the Dee, the Mersey and the Irish Sea, and it forms one geographical and historical unit. Because of that, one's instincts ought to be not to separate it out. The first thoughts of the Minister may have been to view it as a composite whole, but second thoughts have decided that, for the moment at any rate, the Minister wishes it to be divided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to Ellesmere Port, where does its main community lie? Does it lie with Cheshire, with Liverpool, with the Merseyside? One is bound to say that its links are with the Merseyside. Ellesmere Port is entirely industrial and, therefore, it looks to the rest of the industrial area, Merseyside, rather than to Cheshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as Neston is concerned, it is a dormitory area but its people work overwhelmingly in the Merseyside area. I have heard it argued that they probably shop inside Cheshire. I do not think there is much in that, but in any case they earn their money in Merseyside and the money they use is Merseyside money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So here are two areas, one industrial and one dormitory linked with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>555</span>
industry, which it is proposed to sever from the main industrial complex—in other words, to go against the grain and against the community of interest and population that we have discussed in previous Amendments and which ought to be our guide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the population is expanding and it is expanding as an industrial population. As time goes by, this link with Merseyside will become greater, not less. I accept that it is the Government's point that one ought not to look too far ahead because there is always the Commission, and it can always review, but it seems to me that this is something which is happening at the time and is in existence at the time. For that reason also, Ellesmere Port and Neston should have been included in Merseyside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we spoke earlier on another Amendment about community interest and community of population, we also mentioned community of transportation. The road and rail links lead towards Merseyside, not the other way. When the Wirral motorway, the M53, opens—which I hope will be shortly—this transport link will be intensified, not modified. Again, these reasons put Ellesmere Port and Neston logically into Merseyside. They will look, as they do now, towards Liverpool and its many facilities, not least to its educational facilities, to its polytechnic and its fine university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we must consider also the Merseyside Green Belt. The Green Belt which lies between Ellesmere Port and Chester forms a natural boundary between Ellesmere Port and Cheshire. We should bear that in mind when we consider the future of these two areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt deliberately with this matter in general terms because we have much to accomplish this morning, and I hope that the Minister will be able to make some favourable noises at this stage. The force of the argument is strong in all the senses that one ought to consider—historically, geographically, economically, socially and from the point of view of planning and transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I speak to Amendments Nos. 28 and 29 in my name and Amendment No. 129 in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Ince (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
McGuire), who is not a member of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to Amendments Nos. 28 and 29, although I have spoken many times in this Committee about many constituencies, this is my own constituency and I speak with a somewhat special knowledge and special concern about what happens to the delightful parishes of Hale and Halewood, both of which are within the constituency of Widnes. Under the proposal in the Bill, they will be merged into that part of Merseyside which is the present City of Liverpool. Under the Bill it will be the City of Liverpool with these two rural parishes added.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many representations have been made to the Under-Secretary and to the Minister of State by the inhabitants of Hale, particularly on the occasion of the Under-Secretary's visit to Liverpool when representatives from the parish council and from the villagers of Hale put forward what I consider an overwhelming case. Although Hale is near to Liverpool and near industrial Widnes, it remains and retains the characteristics of a rural parish, something very rare in south Lancashire. If any Members of the Committee were to visit this parish of 1,000 inhabitants, the first thing that would strike them would be a number of thatched cottages. The second thing that would strike them, particularly in the spring, would be the fields of flowers, because this is the main horticultural area for Liverpool and the surrounding district. The whole tenor of life in Hale is that of a parish, and of a very delightful parish indeed. Many people visit Hale from my own constituency of Widnes, and also from Liverpool and from far afield, to imbibe the rural parish atmosphere, without going too far away in order to savour the delights of a rural atmosphere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like any parish, Hale has its traditions. It had a very famous inhabitant at the time of King Charles I known as the Child of Hale, who was a giant wrestler about nine feet tall, who brought great distinction to the village—a distinction which now remains in a public house which is named after him. It has the tradition of a village, which may seem unusual and amusing to some Members of the Committee, in its own village Lord Mayor and its own village freemen, the kind of traditions which make an English village unique today. It wants to retain these traditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Hale look to the town of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>557</span>
Widnes for their shopping and for their education, certainly secondary education; the vast majority of children from Hale come into Widnes for secondary education. They look to Widnes for their entertainment and for its friendliness. They come to Widnes market. Indeed, the whole pull, so far as Hale is concerned, is not with the City of Liverpool, although it lies on the river bank between Widnes and Liverpool. It is with the Borough of Widnes, and under the proposals of the Bill the Borough of Widnes goes into the County of Cheshire; and Hale, not unnaturally, wishes to follow the major town and go not into the present City of Liverpool, but to follow Widnes into the County of Cheshire. In this case, the river is forming a link between two towns—and Widnes and Runcorn agree with this—and not a division between two towns. We have one bridge at the moment, and I hope that we shall have two bridges. Hale wishes to go with its major town of Widnes into Cheshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a poll in the village of Hale. I appreciate that there are only 1,000 inhabitants, but some 88 per cent. of those polled, which was the major part of the village—in a village one can get a much higher rate of poll than one can in a town—were firmly of the opinion that they should not go into Liverpool but should go along with Widnes into what will be the new County of Cheshire north of the River Mersey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a number of letters. That is an understatement; I have an overwhelming volume of correspondence not only from individuals in Hale, but from many organisations including the tennis club, prenursery groups, churches and the Townswomen's Guild. All these people have written to me fervently asking that Hale should remain with Widnes and become part of Cheshire and not go into Liverpool.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not quote at any length from those letters, but, to prove how absolutely fair and unbiased I am in this Committee and that I am speaking purely on behalf of my constituents with no political axe to grind whatsoever, I should like to quote from a letter from Mr. Hartland who is the Chairman of the Hale Conservative Association, and if my pleas are of no avail with the Under-Secretary of State, those of his friends in the country may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Hartland says:
	<span class='label label-info column'>558</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Dear Mr. Oakes,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>A petition, signed by 88% of the residents of Hale aged 16 and over was sent to the Secretary of State for the Environment in May 1971. This asked that Hale should go with Widnes into the new Cheshire County instead of being included in the Merseyside Metropolitan area.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Hale's case was generally considered to be a very good one, and no case for Hale being included in Liverpool has been produced. There has been no answer yet to this petition. It seems that the wishes of virtually the entire population of Hale have been ignored.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The members of the Hale Conservative Association have asked me to assure you of their full, wholehearted support in your efforts, on behalf of the people of Hale, to have the case of the village reconsidered and to join them with Widnes in the new County of Cheshire."</p></blockquote>
Whatever lack of eloquence my words may have with hon. Gendemen opposite, I hope they will listen to that very passionate plea from a very worthy gentleman from Hale, Mr. Hartland, who is the Chairman of the Hale Conservative Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to its effect on Liverpool, with which I will deal in a moment when I deal with Halewood, the Under-Secretary will be aware that there is considerable imbalance in the Merseyside metropolitan area. Liverpool is roughly twice as big as any of the other districts of the metropolitan area, both in population and in rateable value, so that it will be no loss at all from a population point of view for 900 to 1,000 people to be given their heads and to go in the direction that they wish to go. In the enormous population of over one million in Liverpool, the loss of 1,000 people from the rural area surrounding certainly would not inconvenience or even dent the surface of the new metropolitan area (	<i>b</i>) of Liverpool, which, as it stands, is twice as big as any other metropolitan area in Merseyside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment also deals with Halewood, and Halewood is a mixed parish. It is half rural, like Hale, and it is half very urban—urban in the sense that there is overspill from Liverpool in the parish of Halewood, and I accept that it adjoins Liverpool. The inhabitants of Halewood, although they are ex-Liverpudlians and have crossed the border into the new parish, like their life in a parish rather than being submerged in a city. They do not want to go back into city government. They have their parish councillors, and their parish councillors unanimously do not want Halewood to go into Cheshire, as Hale wants to do; they want to keep the present rural district of Whiston intact and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>559</span>
to go along with Whiston, of which they have become part and parcel into the new 	<i>District</i> (	<i>c</i>) rather than go back into Liverpool with 	<i>District</i> (	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again I say that this would be no loss at all so far as Liverpool is concerned, because there is this tremendous imbalance at the moment. I repeat, it is twice as big as any other metropolitan district in the Merseyside area, and, if anything, needs pruning down and carving up, rather than being bolstered by the addition of parishes that would naturally fall in another metropolitan area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present parish of Halewood is somewhat annoyed with Liverpool at the moment, and with some justification, because it has taken a considerable amount of land in Halewood. Liverpool have put roads and sewers in the site, and then by a change of policy by Liverpool City Council they have left the site derelict, with the baby, as it were, on the doorstep of the Halewood parish council—an attitude that Liverpool very often adopt with their neighbouring authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Halewood and Whiston are prepared to take over where Liverpool have left off, because there is a tremendous community spirit in the parish of Halewood, just as there is in Hale. I ask the Under-Secretary of the Minister of State in his reply to the debate, to regard just as seriously the protests of the people of Halewood that they wish to go in area (	<i>c</i>) and not area (	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As soon as I say Halewood, hon. Members will think immediately in terms of the Ford factory which has made Halewood famous—sometimes, some Members might say, notorious. However, I would say it has made Halewood famous. The factory has enormous rateable value, and because it has enormous rateable value Liverpool City want it. I say to the Committee without any hesitation that 	<i>District</i> (	<i>b</i>), the present city of Liverpool, not only has twice the population; it has more than twice the rateable value of any other district in the Merseyside area, and to want the factory of Halewood as well is just being plain greedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>District 11</i> (	<i>c</i>), on the other hand, has many problems. It has problems of dereliction in the St. Helens area. It has the problems of Huyton and Kirkby which are very similar to Halewood.
	<span class='label label-info column'>560</span>
They are new authorities with overspill housing and so on. They need that rateable value very badly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to prevent that imbalance and to accede to the wishes of the people of Hale and Halewood, I ask the Under-Secretary to consider the Amendment which puts Hale into Cheshire and Halewood into 	<i>District</i> (	<i>c</i>). That would cure the imbalance and would certainly accede to the wishes of those parishes in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to an area outside my constituency, on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Ince. My hon. Friend endeavoured unsuccessfully to get into the debate on Second Reading to put the point. He wants the Committee to accede to the wishes of Skelmersdale and Holland Urban District Council not to be part of the Merseyside metropolitan area but to be part of Lancashire County Council. They have submitted to the Secretary of State an excellent brochure, which no doubt he and the Under-Secretary have seen, giving their reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To save the Committee's time, I shall therefore not go into all the detailed reasons which are set out there. But I should like to make this point. Skelmersdale is a new town. It is the only new town which is being included in a metropolitan area anywhere in England. All the other new towns are parts of counties. For example, Runcorn New Town is a part of the county of Cheshire. The other new towns are not part of a metropolitan area. The Minister shakes his head, but that is what they say. I will give way if I am wrong on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Washington comes into Tyneside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has found an exception. I withdraw what I said. I am obviously misinformed in thinking that this was the only one. Washington also becomes part of a metropolitan area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Skelmersdale makes the point that, being a new town, it wants to establish itself as a new town. It does not want links and ties with the authorities from which people have come. It wants to set up as a new town, as a new urban area. Coming as I do from Lancashire, I can assure the Committee that there are no ties between Skelmersdale and Holland
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>561</span>
and Liverpool except those of past family connections. The working area and the travel to work area so far as Skelmersdale is concerned is either within Skelmersdale industrial belt or it is to Wigan or St. Helens. It is certainly not to the Liverpool area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Skelmersdale authority realises that the community of interest of the area would be much better served by Skelmersdale going into the County of Lancashire. The Under-Secretary made a very eloquent plea, in reply to an earlier Amendment, with regard to the Leyland Chorley New Town, saying that the very best thing for Leyland Chorley would be to be part of a two-tier authority of Lancashire and not part of a one-tier authority of Preston in a metropolitan borough. The Skelmersdale authority is asking for exactly what the Under-Secretary was advocating in reply to the other debate. It wants to be part of Lancashire, to be part of a two-tier authority and not a one-tier authority. It thinks that Lancashire County Council, as the existing top tier authority, has the knowledge and the expertise in providing services to meet the special needs of this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Skelmersdale, incidentally, was only formed as a town, as a new district, in 1968, some three years ago. The authority says.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The creation of a new community here on a site specially selected for existence independent of other local authorities has been a joint enterprise and any disturbance of the present arrangements must be damaging."</p></blockquote>
In the debate on the New Towns Bill on Friday, 12th November, my hon. friend the Member for Ince raised this point in connection with new towns because it was very apposite as to the future of his constituency and this new town. I quote one short paragraph from what he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There has been much co-operation and liaison, and this view is reinforced by the county council. It is resigned to the fact that it will lose many of its outlying areas, but Sir Patrick McCall, clerk of the county, Alderman Lumby, Conservative chairman of the Lancashire County Council and the urban district council have made out a strong and overwhelming case for the area not being linked with District C. If it is not to be left in the county, it will be more sensible to link it with the Wigan area, or the Southport area, even it it created, perhaps in the mind of hon. Members, some imbalance in the Wigan section, which is in the Greater Manchester Metropolitan Area."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 12th November, 1971; Vol. 826, cc. 1435-6.]</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>562</span>
Therefore, Skelmersdale, the county and the hon. Member who represents that constituency are all strongly of the opinion that the area should not be part of Merseyside but should be part of the new Lancashire County Council. Therefore, on behalf of my hon. Friend, who no doubt himself will at a later stage put the arguments far better and more convincingly than I could, I advance to the Committee the arguments which he would make if he were a member of the Committee, that Skelmersdale and Holland should be part of the Lancashire County Council and not the Merseyside Metropolitan Area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) and say a few words in a minute about Skelmersdale in 	<i>District</i> (c). Before doing that, I should like to refer to Amendment No. 226 suggested by my right hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Frederick Lee) and my hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West (Mr. Armstrong).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment seeks to take Newton-le-Willows out of the far eastern extremity of 	<i>District</i> (c) of Merseyside and bring it into the Warrington area of Cheshire. One can see from the map that Newton-le-Willows Urban District represents a peninsula jutting out from the Merseyside metropolitan council area. It is geographical nonsense to place Burtonwood in Warrington and Newton-le-Willows in St. Helens. One cannot even go directly from Newton-le-Willows to St. Helens without going through Burtonwood. That can probably be seen from the map, but if the Minister had a map showing the transport patterns, as no doubt he has, he would see it even more clearly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, there are no historical links whatsoever between the County Borough of St. Helens and Newton-le-Willows. In terms of education, health—including the district general hospital—social security, the local area for the Department of Employment, all those facilities for Newton-le-Willows are based in Warrington. People's natural pattern of work is linked with Warrington. For example, many of the trade union branches covering the Newton-le-Willows area are based upon Warrington. That indicates, in another dimension which we have not discussed previously—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, the National
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>563</span>
Farmers Union also looks towards Warrington.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to other trade unions, but I am glad that my hon. Friend has mentioned the fact that the National Farmers Union, too, looks towards Warrington. It is another dimension of the concept of community of interest which we have discussed already in the Committee. Again, the whole pattern of transport flows down towards Warrington.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that in terms of the various concepts of community interest which we have already considered, the Minister will look again at the question of Newton-le-Willows to find out whether it is not possible at this stage to consider moving it into the new County of Cheshire so that it will be able to maintain its natural links with the Warrington area, covering shopping, schools, hospitals, jobs and many community activities. It seems to me to be one of the areas which have strayed on the map. I hope that the Minister can provide an adequate explanation for its straying, and also tell us whether he will consider moving it back into the Warrington area, into the new County of Cheshire, where it naturally belongs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the other part of 	<i>District</i> (	<i>c</i>) which seems to me somewhat anomalous. I refer to the urban district of Skelmersdale and Holland to which my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) referred. Here again, there does not seem to be the slightest community of interest between Skelmersdale and Holland and 	<i>District</i> (	<i>c</i>). The exception, of course, is the number of people who have come from Merseyside, from Liverpool itself, into Skelmersdale, who go back to Liverpool to work—they have jobs temporarily in the Liverpool area—but the fact is that the links between Skelmersdale and Holland are not with the Merseyside area as such but rather with areas like Ormskirk, Southport and Wigan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither do residents in the Skelmersdale area look towards St. Helen's for their shopping, work, entertainments or leisure. Insofar as they may have some connections, they would be right across 	<i>District</i> (	<i>c</i>) in Liverpool. It is perfectly true that the teams of Everton and Liverpool are still supported in Skelmersdale, but that is a natural phenomenon whereby in our great conurbations the areas in which
	<span class='label label-info column'>564</span>
teams are supported are rather wider than the immediate town areas. There is certainly very little movement into St. Helens as far as sporting activities are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another important point on the question of transport. The transport links again are principally with Ormskirk, Southport and across the M.6 to Wigan. There is no direct bus service at all between Skelmersdale or Upholland and St. Helens; nor is there a railway service. The railway line between Skelmersdale and St. Helens was taken up after the designation of the new town. The Minister decided this in 1962 on the ground that there was no need for the new town of Skelmersdale to have a link with St. Helens. Now the Minister is creating this unnatural 	<i>District</i> (	<i>c</i>), lumping Skelmersdale and Upholland with St. Helens, when it was decided only 10 years ago that there was not a natural link.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, when the Merseyside Passenger Transport Authority was established in 1969, when the boundaries were delimited, the areas of Skelmersdale and Upholland were excluded. So again, in terms of the community of interests on the transport side there does not seem to be any reason why Skelmersdale should be included in 	<i>District</i> (	<i>c</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another argument why the natural link of Skelmersdale and Upholland is with the new Lancashire county rather than with the Merseyside metropolitan council is that there is a very considerable Green Belt surrounding Skelmersdale and Upholland to the north, south and west. This belt contains some very valuable agricultural land and has been most carefully guarded by the Lancashire County Council. Indeed in 1960 Mr. G. N. Wedd of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government sent a letter on this question discussing the importance of maintaining the Green Belt in this area. Quite clearly there is a great need to maintain this belt around the Skelmersdale Urban District which, of course, cuts it off from the rest of 	<i>District</i> (	<i>c</i>) of the Merseyside metropolitan county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new town, when it is fully developed, will provide the natural basis for one of the new districts in the Lancashire County. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will be able to give us some encouragement on this issue. We were assured that there was something good coming. Perhaps in Christmas week he will find that he can distribute his bounty
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0312">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>565</span>
and give us some encouragement on the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to say a few words on Amendments Nos. 30, 31 and 32 in the names of my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Dell), my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. Silkin) and other hon. Members. The Amendments deal with the retention of Ellesmere Port and Neston in the Mersey-side area. If we look at the map provided, we can see that Ellesmere Port and Neston provide the base of the Wirral Peninsula. Although the geographical features are given, it does not show the extent to which the industrial area of Wirral extends down from Birkenhead and Bebington in the north of the Wirral Peninsula to Ellesmere Port. The industrial area of the Wirral extends without a break along the banks of the river Mersey and the Manchester Ship Canal, from the Wallasey docks in the north to Ellesmere Port in the south. The inclusion of Ellesmere Port in Merseyside would, therefore, form a natural break with the new Cheshire, with a clean break before one comes again to industrial development, until the chemical industrial areas of Widnes, Runcorn, Warrington, Northwich and Winsford are reached. The industries which exist in Ellesmere Port—the oil and motor car industries—are an important part of the economy of Merseyside and should, therefore, be included naturally in the Merseyside County Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes when he was talking about the problem of Halewood, one of the difficulties about the Merseyside metropolitan county is the imbalance created by the very substantial size of 	<i>District</i> (	<i>d</i>)—the district based on the Liverpool County Borough. That will to some extent overbalance the other metropolitan districts in this metropolitan county, and therefore the exclusion of Ellesmere Port and Neston from 	<i>District</i> (	<i>d</i>) will increase to a substantial extent this predominance of Liverpool in the Merseyside Metropolitan County. There will be a weaker Wirral district and, therefore, there will be a relatively stronger Liverpool metropolitan district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an important point in thinking about the balance of the whole metropolitan county that we should ensure considerable strength to the counterveiling
	<span class='label label-info column'>566</span>
power, as it were, the Wirral metropolitan district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, from a land use transportation point of view, the need to look at Ellesmere Port and Neston as part of the Merseyside conurbation has recently been recognised by the independent consultants who have been engaged by the Merseyside County Boroughs and the County Councils of Cheshire and Lancashire in carrying out a land use transportation study.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Originally Ellesmere Port and Neston were excluded from the study area covered by the Merseyside land use transportation study principally for financial reasons. The progress on the study soon showed that these districts should have been included. They were, in fact, subsequently added and included in the Merseyside land use transportation study area with the full approval of the constituent county boroughs and county councils, including the Cheshire County Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true to say that Ellesmere Port and Neston and the five parishes of Chester Rural District would be welcomed by the other authorities in 	<i>District</i> (	<i>d</i>) of this Merseyside metropolitan county which would be a better and stronger district by their inclusion. For their part, the members coming into 	<i>District</i> (	<i>d</i>) from Ellesmere Port and Neston would also have the satisfaction of direct responsibility for services such as the social services and, as proposed in the Bill, for education as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of geography, in terms of employment patterns, in terms of industry, in terms of the whole of the community of Merseyside. Ellesmere Port and Neston should be, as they were in the Minister's first proposals in February of this year, included in Merseyside, and I hope that on this we shall again have some good news from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will deal with the points which have been made in the order in which they were raised on the Amendments which we are now discussing concerning the frontiers of Merseyside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) and the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) were dealing with the biggest debate in this particular group—the issue on the future positioning
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>567</span>
of Ellesmere Port. I say at once that this is an issue where it is difficult to reach a judgment, because there are competing and hard-to-reconcile claims as to which local authority should be chosen to be the parent, so to speak, for the Ellesmere Port area. At the time when we first drew up our proposals, on balance the sorts of argument which we have heard from hon. Members opposite won the day—the arguments as to the totality of the planning of the Mersey and some of the transportation and journey-to-work arguments that we have heard influenced us and tipped the argument in the direction in which they are now arguing. But when the local people came to make their representations to us it was quite apparent, in a way that has not been apparent in many local communities on this scale throughout the country, that there was a very deeply felt conviction that the interests of these people lay with Cheshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument then centred around the position of the north Cheshire industrial belt. By looking at the map one is able to see the line of the argument which was put to us and which, in the end, prevailed upon us to make the switch which was carried out on the publication of the Bill. The argument goes that, once one had decided to exclude from the metropolitan area of Merseyside, Widnes, Runcorn and Warrington, then one had created a very specialised and intensive industrial belt to the north of Cheshire which could as easily be continued along a much longer stretch of the southern bank of the Mersey to include the areas of Ellesmere Port.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that this argument is perfectly coherent, and it is one which influenced us finally in making the decision which we did. There is a very heavy industrial concentration, as has been argued in other cases by hon. Members this morning, in northern Cheshire. Once one accepts the existence of this and accepts that Cheshire will be responsible for the very complex problems of environmental protection and transportation that come out of the acceptance of that fact, then it is perfectly arguable that the industrial belt should be continued westwards to include Ellesmere Port. That was finally the argument that we accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was greatly brought home to us in
	<span class='label label-info column'>568</span>
this exercise that this was something about which the local people themselves felt extremely strongly. One of the problems, as we have said in earlier debates, is that one gets representations from the elected representatives of communities who stress in strong language the deep-felt feelings of the local communities. It is comparatively rare for the local communities themselves to take the initiative and stress how strongly they feel about a matter, but nobody could say this about Ellesmere Port. Anyone at the receiving end of the correspondence on local government reorganisation could not help being impressed by the remarkable campaign that has been waged locally. It is far too comprehensive, and has been carried out with far too great a thoroughness, for it to do anything but reflect the very deep-felt wishes of the local people, in all the organisations that have sent very long, very well argued, very coherent letters about this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we accepted that there was a coherence of industrial belt, that it could be held within the one organisation—that of the new Cheshire County—and that the personal wishes of the people, which is to continue what they regarded as their historic associations with Cheshire, from a shopping point of view, should be considered. A point often made was that simply the geographical lie of the land tended to make them look south as opposed to north, and this was something which led us to make the adjustment that we did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next group of Amendments is that which was spoken to by the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes). They refer to Hale and Halewood. He referred to them as rural parishes. It would take some stretch of the imagination to regard Hale-wood as a rural parish, centred as it is very largely around the Ford factory. We have a problem, which is one that perhaps may one day be tidied up by the Boundary Commission, in that Halewood actually stretches over the border into Liverpool County Borough itself. It was that, coupled with the fact that a very substantial part of the population consists of council housing from the County Borough of Liverpool, which argued, I think indisputably, for maintaining the connection between Halewood and Liverpool, and for not moving the community, as is suggested, into the neighbouring 	<i>District</i> (	<i>c</i>) as provided in these Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0314">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>569</span>
The next group of Amendments deals with Newton-le-Willows. This faces us with the dilemma that the Committee is confronted with continually. If the Government, having considered the matter, move a community out of a metropolitan area, all hon. Members opposite table Amendments to move it back in. When we, having considered the matter, decide that we should not move an area out, hon. Members table Amendments and use precisely the same arguments to move the community out. Newton-le-Willows is a classic example of this. Having looked at the situation and being conscious of the local representations, we felt that the balance of argument was in favour of leaving it within the metropolitan area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to look at some of the communications figures that have been put forward. Two joints were made, one by the hon. Member for Farnworth about the fact that to get from Newton-le-Willows to St. Helens, one had to go through Burtonwood and, therefore, one had to link Burtonwood and Newton-le-Willows. My own view is that this is essentially something that should be done by the Boundary Commission, if it has to be done at some subsequent date. The vast majority of Burtonwood lies well to the south of Newton-le-Willows and would not therefore be affected by this transportation problem. Again, it is interesting to note that the bus services running from Newton-le-Willows indicate that the argument lies on balance with the metropolitan area. There are 96 buses daily to Warrington from Newton-le-Willows, but 131 buses going north, or west or east, into the metropolitan areas which surround it. I think this indicates that largely the balancing factors lie in favour of leaving Newton-le-Willows within the metropolitan county, as we have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will by now have learned to look forward to the generous approach with which deal with all these Amendments as they come forward. I think they have seen in me a sort of Father Christmas benefactor, full of sympathy and wishing to help; and of course it would be totally untypical if I did not continue with the tradition which I have established in dealing with some of the Amendments which have been put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, returning to the Amendment dealt with by the hon. Member for Widnes in respect of Hale, this area was
	<span class='label label-info column'>570</span>
very warmly represented to me at the meeting I held as being a village community, somehow—indeed almost miraculously—preserved in the great industrial sprawl, and that there would be the feeling that it would be more likely to retain the characteristics which were quite evident, and which were testified to by a very large number of people locally, if it were to find its way into the Cheshire County and be associated with Widnes, with which it has many other links, to which the hon. Member drew the attention of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the Amendment tabled with this in mind, because for technical reasons the Amendment does not achieve what we would want to secure; but I give the assurance to the Committee that on Report the Government will seek to move—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Stephen. I wonder whether you would accept a manuscript Amendment in the spirit of what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has said. If we were to move a manuscript Amendment, in Schedule 1, page 183, line 5, leave out "parishes of Hale and" and insert "parish of", it would meet what my hon. Friend is saying at the moment. That is in substitution for Amendment No. 28 proposed by the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

manuscript Amendment will deal effectively with the situation. I am delighted to be able to agree with the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) in allowing Hale to go into Cheshire and form part of whatever district pattern is then agreed for that new county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 129 concerns Skelmersdale, about which I had great difficulty when listening to the representations. However one looks at this, the overwhelming majority of members of that community are people who have emigrated recently from Liverpool. They have a journey-to-work pattern into the conurbation. It is artificial to deny the existence of these strong historical links of family, culture and background with the people of Skelmersdale and the conurbation. I found this argument impossible to refute, and it was the balancing argument when it came to the presentation of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, other arguments were put forward. I pay tribute to those who presented the case for Skelmersdale at the meeting, because it was obvious that the arguments put forward this morning by the hon. Members for Widnes and Farnworth were deeply felt locally by the community which was striving to establish itself at Skelmersdale. Those concerned felt that they had grappled with the problem of a new town and that they were creating, and wished to go on creating, a great sense of community. They impressed upon me, not only the feeling of independence, but their ability to foster that feeling of independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is the Government's decision to accept Amendment No. 129 to move Skelmersdale from the metropolitan district back into the county of Lancashire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sir Stephen, would it be appropriate at this stage for me to seek to withdraw Amendment No. 28? I sincerely thank the Minister for Local Government and Development and the Under-Secretary for conceding the spirit of the Amendment. As the Under-Secretary said, it is in accordance with the overwhelming wishes of the people of Hale. I am a little disappointed with regard to Halewood. There is some force in what the Under-Secretary says. We might go into the question of Halewood at a later stage. I do not

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak with particular reference not to Amendment No. 413, but to some of the other Amendments in this group. Altogether, there are about 46 Amendments incorporating 12 proposals for altering the Bill in connection with the proposed County of West Yorkshire, and I want to comment on about half of these proposals. It is probably better for me to do so in one speech, rather than to bob up and down, and I shall be as expeditious as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 157, 159 and 161 seek to include the whole of the Hemsworth rural district in the proposed County of West Yorkshire, whereas under the Bill that rural district will be split three ways, part in West Yorkshire, part in South Yorkshire and part in North Yorkshire. I do not wish to comment on that proposal in general, but I do wish to make specific reference to one village, part of which is in the Hemsworth rural district and will be vitally affected by the changes proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The village in question is Wentbridge. The unusual feature about it is that although it is a fully defined village at the point the Great North Road crosses the River Went, it is a village without a parish council. Wentbridge is divided between three parishes. That part of it to the north of the River Went lies in the parish of Darrington, which is in Osgoldcross rural district in my constituency. That part of it to the south of the River Went is partly in the parish of Thorpe Audlin, and partly in the parish of Kirk Smeaton. It might interest hon. Members to know that it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>577</span>
the village in which the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer lives. I am not fully conversant with the facts, but I understand that the parish boundary between Thorpe Audlin and Kirk Smeaton goes through his garden, but I do not know on which side of the line his house lies. Under the Bill, that line will become a county boundary between West Yorkshire and North Yorkshire. Some effort should be made in this Committee to ensure that the community of Wentbridge is incorporated in one parish in one county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[Mr. ARTHUR JONES in the Chair]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether that will be possible when the Boundary Commission gets to work after the Bill becomes law. There may be added difficulties arising from the fact that the new county boundary between West Yorkshire and North Yorkshire will go through the village of Wentbridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 362, 403 and 412 seek to include Osgoldcross rural district, a vital part of my constituency, in the proposed County of West Yorkshire. Under the Bill only two parishes in this rural district, those of Darrington and East Hardwick, will be included in West Yorkshire. The rest of the rural district will be part of North Yorkshire. Osgoldcross rural district is named after one of the ancient Saxon Wapentakes in Yorkshire. However interesting that may be, and however strong the community life of individual villages in the Osgoldcross district may be, I cannot convince myself that the district as a whole can survive intact the genera] framework of the counties proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The shape of Osgoldcross rural district is somewhat irregular and, in my view, it is not a cohesive social unit. Parts of that district look towards Pontefract, Knottingley and Castleford, parts look towards Selby and parts look towards Goole, and part even looks towards Doncaster. The proposal in the Amendments to treat Osgoldcross as a whole—as was proposed in the White Paper—is somewhat unrealistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[Sir STEPHEN MCADDEN in the Chair]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The division of the district as recommended in the Bill is the best that my constituents can hope to achieve within the
	<span class='label label-info column'>578</span>
context of the Government's overall proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to Amendments Nos. 234 and 235 which seek to include the urban district of Horbury within the metropolitan district of West Yorkshire, which is to be centred on Wakefield, rather than in the metropolitan district which will include Dewsbury and Huddersfield. In other words, the Amendments propose that Horbury should be transferred from West Yorkshire 	<i>District</i> (	<i>d</i>) to West Yorkshire 	<i>District</i> (	<i>e</i>). This is what was proposed in the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The map showing the boundaries proposed for West Yorkshire shows that Horbury lies at the centre of the industrial part of Yorkshire and is contiguous with the county borough of Wakefield. Slightly to the west of Wakefield it is very much part and parcel of the whole community which is based on Wakefield, and it is part of the Wakefield Parliamentary constituency. It has a population of 8,914, and I am told that public opinion in Horbury is very much behind this proposal. People in the area want to be in the metropolitan district which includes Wakefield, rather than in the metropolitan district which includes Huddersfield and Dewsbury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Adjacent to Horbury on the north side is the municipal borough of Ossett, but again having a common boundary with the county borough of Wakefield. Amendments Nos. 355 and 357 propose that Ossett should be transferred from the metropolitan district based on Dewsbury and Huddersfield to the metropolitan district based on Wakefield. This, to my mind, is a difficult case. It is not easy to weigh up where the interests of the community lie. Certainly Ossett has close links with the county borough of Dewsbury, but it also has close links with the county borough of Wakefield. If the metropolitan district including Dewsbury had been centred on Dewsbury, my judgment would have been that Ossett should be included with Dewsbury, but that is not the case. The metropolitan district which includes Dewsbury is centred upon Huddersfield, and Ossett has closer ties with Wakefield than with Huddersfield. I therefore suggest that there are strong grounds for transferring the municipal borough of Ossett, which has a population of 17,000, from the metropolitan district based on Dewsbury and Huddersfield to the metropolitan district based upon Wakefield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0319">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>579</span>
I see that among these Amendments there are proposals for creating other new metropolitan districts in West Yorkshire. In particular, Amendments Nos. 89 to 94 propose the creation of an additional metropolitan district within West Yorkshire, taking in some of the municipal boroughs and urban districts which lie between Leeds and Bradford. That would be a kind of buffer metropolitan district but, unfortunately, it would be in two separate parts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 189 proposes that the county borough of Leeds should be a metropolitan district by itself. That would leave the rest of metropolitan 	<i>District</i> (	<i>b</i>) as a kind of annular metropolitan district surrounding the present county borough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the proposals for new metropolitan districts come from hon. Members who support Government, and I can appreciate the difficulties in which they have found themselves. We should be relieved of all this discussion about the exact boundaries of metropolitan districts in West Yorkshire if instead of being a metropolitan county, West Yorkshire were to be a non-metropolitan county and in Amendments Nos. 117, 153 and 164 we ask that West Yorkshire, with the boundaries proposed in this Bill, should be given non-metropolitan status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said during our debate on Humberside, one of the differences between the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties proposed in this Bill is that the district boundaries are finalised within metropolitan counties, but in non-metropolitan counties the district boundaries are left to be settled by the Boundary Commission. I find that rather puzzling. I cannot see what principle there can be behind that distinction. Why should the district boundaries in non-metropolitan counties be left for the Boundary Commission to settle after adequate consultation with existing local authorities, while the district boundaries in the metropolitan counties are finally and rigidly laid down in the Bill? I agree that the districts have different functions in the two kinds of county, but there must be guidelines for drawing up the districts in both kinds of county. I cannot see why there should be this distinction between the two types of county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that the metropolitan district boundaries in West Yorkshire have been arrived at without thorough consultation with the local authorities, and without any
	<span class='label label-info column'>580</span>
proper scientific study based on the needs of the area under any proposed two-tier system of local government. To see how this has all come about I have to go back to the proposals made in the Redcliffe-Maud Report about West Yorkshire. In that report West Yorkshire was not included as a metropolitan county. It was given five unitary authorities, and the Redcliffe-Maud Commission gave the following reasons for its conclusion:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… we considered whether a two-tier structure was needed, as in the metropolitan areas, with a single authority for land use planning and transportation for the whole of urbanised West Yorkshire.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We found, however, that the West Yorkshire towns differ from those of the Merseyside, Selnec and West Midlands metropolitan areas for geographical and historical reasons. The West Yorkshire conurbation is looser in its physical and economic structure. It contains more open land and this is reflected in a lower overall density of population. Some of its urban communities have coalesced, as in the Dewsbury-Batley area, but on the whole West Yorkshire is still a series of separate places, some of which because of physical barriers are unlikely to grow together. The independent growth and character of West Yorkshire towns is illustrated by the fact that only nine miles from Leeds, with its half-million people, there has grown up the conurbation's second city of Bradford, with nearly 300,000, filling to some extent a parallel rôle as a focus for smaller places round it. Leeds is by far the strongest of the urban magnets in West Yorkshire, and our evidence suggests that it is extending its influence, but it is some way from the commanding rôle played in other conurbations by Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham."</p></blockquote>
So the Redcliffe-Maud Commission drew up five unitary areas for West Yorkshire, and the boundaries of those five unitary areas were taken up by the Labour Government as metropolitan districts in their proposals for a new metropolitan county. The boundaries at that stage were taken over lock, stock and barrel from the unitary authority boundaries. No consideration was given then to the question whether these units were the right size for metropolitan district status. The reason for this change on the part of the Labour Government was that they wished to introduce a two-tier local government structure for West Yorkshire. They introduced this in contradistinction to the unitary area structure. The arguments which were then adduced by the Labour Government for metropolitan status for West Yorkshire were arguments based on this choice.

relevant in our present discussion, because we will have two-tier structure throughout the country, and we are not faced with the choice between metropolitan two-tier structure or unitary structure. We will have two-tier structure for West Yorkshire, and I suggest that this makes irrelevant many of the arguments which were used in the past for metropolitan status for West Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then the boundaries for metropolitan districts in West Yorkshire were amended in the present Government's White Paper. The outer county boundary for West Yorkshire was drawn in somewhat, and the Dewsbury-Spenboro area was transferred from 	<i>District</i> (	<i>e</i>) to 	<i>District</i> (	<i>d</i>). Again, in the proposals in the Bill the outer county boundary for West Yorkshire has been drawn even further inwards, but the internal district boundaries are left unchanged, with the exception of Horbury, to which I referred earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of this history, there has never been a proper two-tier study for West Yorkshire which could give us appropriate boundaries for metropolitan districts in this new county. The boundaries which are now suggested have grown, like Topsy, out of Redcliffe-Maud's unitary areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the case for West Yorkshire to be metropolitan, let us examine how far the county meets the present Government's own criteria. I quote again a passage from the Government's White Paper last February, Cmnd. 4584, paragraph 31:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The metropolitan pattern is suitable only where a county is divisible into districts all of which are populous and compact."</p></blockquote>
West Yorkshire, as now proposed in the Bill, has an overall density of 4.1 persons per acre, compared with a density of 19.5 in Greater London and 9.5 in the Merseyside metropolitan county as proposed. The five suggested metropolitan districts for West Yorkshire have population densities respectively of 4.8, 5.4, 2.2, 3.7 and 3.5 persons per acre, taking them in the order, (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>), (	<i>d</i>), (	<i>e</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most sparsely populated district of these five, the one which includes Halifax, must surely be the most un-metropolitan of all the metropolitan districts proposed in the Bill, even considering South Shields, which has less population than West Yorkshire District (	<i>c</i>), but has a
	<span class='label label-info column'>582</span>
much smaller area than that Yorkshire district. The population density of the metropolitan district which includes Halifax is, at 2.2, less than the density of the non-metropolitan counties of Surrey and Hertfordshire proposed in the Bill, which have densities, I calculate, of 2.4 and 2.3 persons per acre respectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those members of the Committee who know the area of Halifax and the Pennine valleys well will appreciate the pattern of settlement in those parts and how it is very much confined to the steep valleys. It is a character of this area which is observed through much of the Pennine region as a whole and which I think led to the description which I have quoted from the Maud-Redcliffe Report. The small towns are quite distinct from one another, and so are many of their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Report No. 7 of the Special Review Area Local Government Commission for England, of February, 1964, reporting on the West Yorkshire Special Review Area, says this in paragraph 21:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With some exceptions the main problems which we have mentioned are problems of the separate towns within the area and not problems of the review area as a whole. The effective solution of the problem in each place does not depend to any marked degree on co-ordinating inter-relating plans. Nor is overspill a problem for the area as a whole. No town in it needs a major overspill scheme at a distance from its boundaries. The grave problems of. housing and urban renewal which face many authorities are not parts of a single review area problem. The traffic problems of the area, again, are in no real sense problems of the whole area, but rather problems of the several towns and cities."</p></blockquote>
That was in 1964; and I agree that the situation has altered somewhat since then, though as far as I am aware, and knowing West Yorkshire as I do, there has been no drastic alteration to the situation within the last seven years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the functions of metropolitan as opposed to non-metropolitan counties, I must bring to the attention of the Committee the very widespread concern which there is in the present West Riding over the educational future. As Members of the Committee will appreciate, the West Riding education authority commands high regard, and although no realistic appraisal can allow for the continuation of that authority within the context of the Bill, there is some alarm that the authority should now face such severe fragmentation. My own political party would like to see
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0321">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>583</span>
education as a county responsibility in the metropolitan counties, rather than as a district function as proposed in the Bill. The Amendments to which I am speaking would achieve this as regards West Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present educational administration there are many divisional executive committee areas in the West Riding which by these proposals will be split, either into different metropolitan counties or between different metropolitan districts. In a county where non-selective secondary education is well advanced, based already on an established pattern of school buildings, redistribution, so as to be aligned with metropolitan districts, will lead to a confused picture for quite a number of years. For a specific example of this I refer to the problems which will be faced by the Rothwell and Stanley Divisional Education Committee which covers the area where I live. I speak for my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. Albert Roberts) whose constituency includes that area when I say that he has been overwhelmed by a flood of letters from people interested and engaged in the educational world, teachers and parents, who cannot see how the pattern to which they are now accustomed within their divisional education area of Rothwell and Stanley can be satisfactorily adjusted for a very long time ahead if the proposals of the Bill go ahead unamended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I see it, these are the considerations which cover the major differences between metropolitan and non-metropolitan county status as proposed in the Bill. For me, the argument points clearly to non-metropolitan status for West Yorkshire. This, above everything else, would enable county district boundaries to be subject to further consultation between all the local authorities concerned and not finally and rigidly laid down in the Bill. What is more, the Amendment would transfer educational responsibilities to county level, where they rightly belong so far as West Yorkshire is concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marcus Fox</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak to Amendment No. 158 and the consequent Amendment No. 160, which stand in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West (Sir D. Kaberry), the purpose of which is to include Harrogate in the West Yorkshire metropolitan county 	<i>District</i> (	<i>b</i>) and to remove it
	<span class='label label-info column'>584</span>
from the North Yorkshire non-metropolitan county. It is to revert back to the proposals as enunciated in the White Paper. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-West obviously has a particular interest in the City of Leeds. My concern is for the two boroughs, five urban district councils and 30 parishes which still remain within this metropolitan district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of this change between the White Paper and what was said on Second Reading, there is a feeling of disillusionment. The councils to which I have referred accepted reluctantly, in certain cases, the original proposals. The change which the Secretary of State has sought fit to bring about has, I believe, dismayed them. This can be instanced by the number of Amendments which have been put down. There is a mad scramble to opt out of this particular metropolitan district. When one realises that 20 per cent. of the people who live outside the City of Leeds have virtually been removed from this metropolitan district, their anxiety can be understood. Personally, I have had reason on certain occasions to doubt the ambitions of certain cities. There are fears of domination in any proposals of reform of local government, and it would be wrong to encourage in any way this feeling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By removing Harrogate, I believe that automatically the feeling is that the City of Leeds will dominate this area 6(	<i>b</i>). I question the grounds on which my hon. Friend the Minister has taken this decision. What grounds can there be? It cannot be because of the affinity which Harrogate has with North Yorkshire. Harrogate has no roots in North Yorkshire. It belongs to the West Yorkshire area. The other towns in the North Yorkshire non-metropolitan county are an integral part of the countryside and the economy. York, with its 1900 years of history, and the market towns of Ripon, Richmond and Northallerton act as centres for the surrounding countryside. These are settlements of considerable age, and the reasons why they are established there are understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Harrogate, in contrast, has no social roots, if one looks at its history, and its location. It is entirely a creation of the 19th century. It is a spa town which has grown into a holiday resort. It has no connection with the staple economy of North Yorkshire agriculture. No market
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>585</span>
exists, neither are there any shops, to supply farmers. Harrogate has no close links with the North Yorkshire countryside and relies for its prosperity on the West Yorkshire conurbation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The traffic flow must surely be significant. Both by public transport and car, the Harrogate to Leeds route is more widely used than all the other routes out of Harrogate, whether it be for journeys to work, shopping or entertainment, and the links between Leeds and Harrogate are obvious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the limited time at my disposal, I shall not go into the industrial or trade links between the units within 6(	<i>b</i>) and Harrogate; every Yorkshireman understands these. The regional links are there and Harrogate has always looked to the West Riding County Council or to the Leeds City Council for its services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find the reasons for its exclusion hard to believe. I have already dealt with the community of interest. The other reason given is the maintenance of the Green Belt. I hoped that my hon. Friend would say a word about that. I suggest that times have changed. The rapacious greed for land that certain cities showed in the past has been controlled, and certainly the City of Leeds and the West Riding County Council have behaved with considerable responsibility in the last few years in maintaining a Green Belt. With all members of the Committee I agree that this is vital. If one argues that to take Harrogate out has been done to preserve the Green Belt, surely the same reason must be given to remove places such as Bardsey, Boston Spa and Wetherby. They have exactly the same claim as Harrogate, and I do not believe that planning protection cannot be obtained within the original proposals of the metropolitan district which I am referring to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit to my hon. Friend the Minister that this is a free-standing town; that it has no links with the North Yorkshire county. It can be compared with South-port which the Government have seen fit to include in Merseyside. For all these reasons, I ask my hon. Friend to look at this again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I refer very briefly to a subject which the hon. Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall) referred to? I could not agree with him in his statement about Ossett. I think it
	<span class='label label-info column'>586</span>
was on Amendment No. 355. This is a town which I lived in for a considerable time. I would only say that I support his view on Horbury. I think it is wrong to include Horbury in 	<i>District</i> (	<i>d</i>); most certainly it should be in (	<i>e</i>). A look at the map is sufficient. All I can say, having lived all my life a few miles from Horbury, is that it is connected with Wakefield and is nothing at all to do with Dewsbury or Huddersfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow and support, but in broader terms, the advocacy of the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox). I do so in terms of the conception throughout the reports and recommendations from this Government and the previous Government and the Royal Commission that Harrogate has essential links with Leeds and an essential community of interest with that great city. I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall) say that he looked at this proposed metropolitan area as being more suited to a non-metropolitan context. To some extent, what he said ties up with the appreciation that I have tried to bring to bear on this proposed metropolitan area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Royal Commission Report on page 196 reference is made to the fact that, in putting a whole series of free-standing towns in with Leeds, there is recognition that these towns have grown up independently:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A number of towns nearby which grew up independently, with distinctive local industries, are linked economically with Leeds."</p></blockquote>
So there is a recognition of the close link with these towns to the north of Leeds, one of which is Harrogate. In the following paragraph on page 196 there is specific reference to Harrogate in this unit proposed in the Royal Commission Report; that is Unit 8: Leeds, and the close affinities of Harrogate with Leeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not closely familiar with this district, and for much of what I shall say I have had to rely on the Reader's Digest A.A. Book of the Road, because we do not have maps and plans to show us adequately all the points that are being made in this Committee. I have found this map extraordinarily helpful. I see Harrogate, and that the mileage is 17; and then I see a series of other free-standing towns north of Leeds—Wetherby, Otley, Ilkley, Silsden—of a similar character to Harro
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>587</span>
gate. I see from the Royal Commission Report that Harrogate is
	<br><blockquote><p>"… a residential area for the West Yorkshire conurbation. In 1966, 1,700 Harrogate residents worked within the officially-defined conurbation, the majority, 1,400, in Leeds."</p></blockquote>
So, clearly, it is a residential settlement for people with business interests in Leeds. The independence of these towns to which I have referred is the reason why there is much to be said for the concept of a non-metropolitan county for this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The connection with this area north of Leeds is recognised in the Royal Commission Report. It was recognised by the previous Government in their proposals under the unitary system, and recognised by the present Government in their original White Paper and their proposals, which did include Harrogate with Leeds. If it is now contested that Harrogate should lie outside the West Yorkshire metropolitan county, how does the case stand up for not excluding a series of these other towns and areas which I have mentioned? When one looks at the area immediately east of Otley, across to Wetherby, generally speaking, looking at this map, it seems to me to have the characteristics of open country. I do not have a contour map, but, if my memory serves me correctly, it is open rolling moorland country. If we are to exclude Harrogate, how can all that be brought into the metropolitan County of Leeds?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one looks to the west of Otley, Ilkley is certainly free-standing; with Rombald's Moor stretching for 10 or 12 miles south of Ilkley; Silsden, it is suggested, should be in the Leeds metropolitan area; and south of Kildwick there is Keighley Moor with Keighley immediately east of it; below that there is Haworth Moor, and Wadsworth Moor, running down to Hebden Bridge. I recognise that these moors are within the West Yorkshire county boundary, as now defined. Further south still there is Heppenstall Moor, and south-east of Todmorden there is high country with lakes and water reservoirs. When one looks at the area immediately east of Hebden Bridge there is a wide stretch of open country lying immediately north of Halifax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So how can it be said that if Harrogate is to be excluded, one ought not to think in terms of excluding all these other areas of high landscape value, which have no greater affinity with Leeds itself, and with
	<span class='label label-info column'>588</span>
Bradford, than Harrogate? There is not the same open countryside east of Leeds but, according to my map, there is a series of towns there, Pontefract, Castleford, Knottingley, and north of that, on either side of the A1, it looks open country, generally speaking, leading up west of Tadcaster to Wetherby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, having taken a course around this metropolitan county, except in the area where it joins the metropolitan area in the south—this is South Yorkshire metropolitan county—on the north, east and the west there is open country. I know there is a county boundary on the west, but if there is a strong case for Harrogate to be excluded from the West Yorkshire metropolitan county, I cannot see how it can withstand the advocacy for taking out other free-standing towns in this open countryside west and north-west of Leeds and Bradford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have had to face the problems of the creation of a metropolitan county based on West Yorkshire, but they have done it in a very rough way. They have not had regard to communities of interest to the extent that I have seen and welcomed elsewhere. Before coming to a definite conclusion on the immediate issue of Harrogate, I should like to hear a defence from my hon. Friend of the situation which I have tried to outline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These Amendments cover a wide area and a large number of towns, villages and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones) has said, some of the open country in West Yorkshire. I notice that not all the Amendments on the Order Paper have been discussed, so I shall try to confine my remarks not to the whole list of Amendments as grouped, but to those which have been mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major point that has arisen from the speech of the hon. Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall) is whether this should be a metropolitan or a non-metropolitan area. As the hon. Member for Goole pointed out, Redcliffe-Maud made five unitary areas of approximately the same area which we are now calling the West Yorks. metropolitan area. Under the Redcliffe-Maud proposals, two-tier counties or areas were to be an exception to the unitary areas. Redcliffe-Maud made only three exceptions in the whole of its proposals, so that it would have been very exceptional within the recommendations of Redcliffe-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0324">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>589</span>
Maud to make this a metropolitan area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Government in their White Paper chose to make this a two-tier area in the same way as the present Government have done in this Bill, but with this difference. With the previous Government, two-tier areas were to be the exception. With the present Government two-tier areas are universal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question for us is what kind of two-tier there should be for this area. Should it be non-metropolitan, or should it be metropolitan? The arguments of the Redcliffe-Maud Report, put into the context of the Bill, support the type of area which we have chosen—the metropolitan area. Maud pointed out that this conurbation is looser in its physical and economic structure perhaps than other metropolitan areas. Therefore, if there are these several towns comprising this area with looser connections than in some of the other areas, it is right that one should give them the metropolitan district status if within those towns they are compact and populous and that they have, by that very character, earned a metropolitan area status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Maud pointed out quite clearly that West Yorks. is a series of separate towns. Using that phrase, it might be thought that I am arguing against our principles of building a metropolitan area. I do not think I am. These are separate compact towns making up this area with wedges of countryside between them—wedges which one hopes will not necessarily be developed; and certainly where they are Green Belt wedges it is greatly to be hoped they will never be developed. They are the lungs of this area. I can assure the Committee that this Government do not consider that by including Green Belt areas in a metropolitan area those areas are doomed—far from it. The metropolitan area must look after its Green Belt just as much as a non-metropolitan area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By the inclusion of wedges between these free standing towns—I say "free standing" in this connection because I was thinking more of their compactness in themselves, but depending upon each other throughout this metropolitan area—we think it is right to give them the metropolitan status, but to bind them together within a metropolitan area because they are so dependent one upon the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>590</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Northants, South did a rapid tour round the fringe of the area. It is perfectly true that taking the area to the west we have included a number of areas of moorland to which he referred, but looking at the development out from the centres of Leeds and Bradford one sees a continuous build-up along certain valleys there. Throughout Airedale up to Silsden there is a clear development which looks to the centre—Bradford, Leeds and Keighley areas—for its dependence. We took the boundary as far as Silsden, because that in certain feasibility studies has been recommended as a growth area and it has a future as a growth area at the western end of Airedale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Going across the moor to the north-west to Ilkley and Otley, these are difficult points upon which to reach a decision. Ilkley at one time was a spa town on its own, but it has become so very closely tied with Leeds and Bradford that I do not think one can say it is independent of the conurbation. Where Otley and Ilkley join in the top of a "Y" shape at Menston the whole pull is towards the Leeds and Bradford area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a difficult decision to reach whether to include Ilkley and its neighbouring area of Burley-in-Wharfedale with the Bradford district. It was not so difficult to come to a decision over Otley, because Otley is much closer to the built-up area and development of Leeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that, when one takes a line across the north of the Leeds district to Wetherby, one is crossing open country, as my hon. Friend the Member for Northants, South pointed out, and it may be that one ought to adjust that line along parish boundaries there, but roughly we were following Wharfedale and the River Wharfe along that boundary. This seemed to be a natural boundary between Harrogate and Leeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take strong issue with my hon. Friend the Member for Northants, South and my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox) on their descriptions of Harrogate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I correct the record? My descriptions were taken from the Royal Commission Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

fact, we have gone against it in many respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Harrogate cannot be compared with the smaller towns like Ilkley, Otley and Wetherby; it cannot be said that these are several free-standing towns, all alike, from which people will commute to Leeds. It is true that there is a strong commuter run from Harrogate to Leeds and from Harrogate to Bradford, but out of a population of 62,000 people in Harrogate only 1,700 work within the conurbation. Most of those living in Harrogate work in Harrogate, and it is in the real sense of the word a free-standing town.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fox</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that Harrogate has a considerable population of retired people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, but that does not seem to be any reason for it to be joined to Leeds or to the conurbation. Between Leeds and Harrogate there are seven or eight miles of open countryside. I think it was right for us to think again between the Government's White Paper and the preparation of the Bill to exclude Harrogate from the conurbation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Shipley said that he feared that, with the exclusion of Harrogate, Leeds would dominate this conurbation. I do not think that it will do so nearly as much as Liverpool, Manchester or Birmingham will in their respective conurbations. Leeds is not as dominant a centre of this conurbation as those three I have mentioned. It is not right to say that Harrogate relies for its prosperity on Leeds. Harrogate relies for its prosperity now upon itself and its development as a freestanding town. I therefore cannot agree to the proposals made by my hon. Friends the Members for Shipley and for Northants, South.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Goole took another tour around the district. He dealt with the village of Wentbridge in Hemsworth. With regard to Hemsworth, we adopted here a division which is entirely against the general rule which we have adopted throughout the local government reform. We have split Hemsworth rural district into three. It is the shape of an inverted triangle. We looked at the draw of work from each side of that triangle and found it necessary to divide the rural district into those three parts. In doing that one is bound to draw the
	<span class='label label-info column'>592</span>
boundary line wrongly somewhere. I am sure that the hon. Member is right to draw the Committee's attention to what we have done in Wentbridge. I hope that we will be able to correct that, even if we do not finish the Amendments today, by the time that we next sit. I shall consider it with great care. If it is not possible to tidy it up at this stage, it will be an admirable case for the Boundary Commission; but I should like to see whether we could do it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member also mentioned Osgoldcross. I was glad to have his support for the division which has had to be made there, the two parishes going to the west and the rest to the east. With regard to Horbury and Ossett, Horbury was a difficult case to decide. Horbury is now on the west side of the M1, with Wakefield on the east side. To that extent it is divided from Wakefield. Although the hon. Member for Goole said otherwise, I understood that Horbury wanted to be with Dewsbury and Huddersfield district.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am led to understand that, although leading spokesmen in the town wanted to be included in the same metropolitan district as Dewsbury and Huddersfield, the general populace thought otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman can produce confirmation of that for me. At the moment the information I have is from the voting of the council, which was that Horbury wanted to be in the Dewsbury and Huddersfield district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am tempted by figures to switch anything that wants to be switched from Huddersfield to the Wakefield area. If one moved Horbury, with its population of 8,900, it would reduce the Dewsbury-Huddersfield district to 386,000 and increase the Wakefield-Pontefract district to 284,000, so it is attractive from that point of view. I also notice from the figures that the journeys to work from Horbury are much greater to Wakefield than to either Dewsbury or Huddersfield. If I may look again into the wishes of Horbury and the hon. Gentleman would do so also, perhaps we can discuss this further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One usually takes Horbury and Ossett together, but there is a clear distinction between these two. Although I am informed that Ossett decided that it wanted to go with Dewsbury only by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>593</span>
mayor's casting vote, it is probably right that Ossett should go with Dewsbury. The difficulty here is that Ossett wants to be with Dewsbury, but at the same time it is with Huddersfield with which it has little connection. I can appreciate that it is torn between the two: not wanting to be with Huddersfield, but wanting to be with its neighbour Dewsbury. A clear line can be drawn between Horbury and Ossett. I am not persuaded that we should alter the map so far as Ossett is concerned. The hon. Member for Goole referred particularly to the Halifax area, and I have probably covered these points in dealing with the general proposition that West Yorks. should be a non-metropolitan area. I agree that to the west of the Halifax district the country is not heavily populated, but to the east there is a high density of population. We were presented with the possibility of cutting off the western part of the Halifax district, but it seemed reasonable to include it with the rest of the Halifax district which has always been together, rather than to cut it off. That is the reason for the low population density in Halifax. It is the unpopulated area to the west as against the very densely populated area to the east. I think that we have drawn the boundaries right and I would not like to move them any further in from the west than they are at the moment. The hon. Gentleman will recall that we moved the western boundaries of this metropolitan district much further down from the north-west between the publication of the White Paper and the Bill. I think that we were right to exclude the more countrified areas to the north-west.
