	<p>Amendment proposed [8th June], No. 2, in page 2, line 45, leave out from beginning to end of line 19 on page 3 and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 of this Act."—[	<i>Mrs. Castle</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed</i>, That the Amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members will have noticed that I have selected Amendments No. 75, in page 3, line 8, leave out "sixty" and insert "sixty-five"; and No. 76, in line 9, leave out "fifty-five" and insert "sixty"; to be debated with Amendments Nos. 2 and 10 on which the Committee are still engaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Marsden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I look upon myself as a kindly man, and so if I say anything that appears offensive I apologise immediately, but one or two things said during our last Sitting stuck in my craw because of the attitude of some people towards invalids. I therefore looked at the speeches on 15th June, 1908, when Lloyd George was Chancellor of the Exchequer and was trying to get his Old-age pensions Bill through the Commons. Many hon. Members spoke, including Mr. Balfour, Mr. Chaplin, Mr. Asquith, Mr. H. Cox and Lord Cecil, and the theme running through their speeches was, "Where is the money coming from?" Somebody went so far as to say that this would ruin the country economically. It would seem that we still have this attitude, "Where is the money coming from?" This is the cry that has rung down through the ages. I find this so distasteful when there is plenty of money in this country, and the money should be found. This is what the public think, that there is plenty of money in the United Kingdom. This is what politics is
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
all about—how do we cut up the national cake?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another thing which I found equally distasteful was the different rates in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (c) of this subsection. The operative words here are "in the home". A person can be in an iron lung at home, or sitting in a chair by the fire. I know what situation I would prefer, whether I were 18 or 60 years of age. Suffering cannot be measured by age groups. Now it would appear that women suffer less than men. These rates in (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) are a gross injustice and cause anomalies by the thousand. I wou'd like to see them done away with altogether. Whatever Government are in power they will come round to this eventually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the one invalidity pension, and if one person gets a few new pence more than somebody else I do not think it matters so far as the invalid is concerned. It seems to me that it would be sensible to have one fiat rate at the highest of these levels. The Clause reflects Government policy outlined in the Budget. The Amendment would increase the purchasing power of a small section of our community. I support the Amendment in a reluctant kind of way. I am all in favour of one statutory pension for invalids.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sydney Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee met on Thursday an observer might have got the impression that the Government had turned us down entirely, but we have not yet finished debating the subject and we are hoping that the Minister will reply to what has been said subsequent to his speech to the Committee. There appeared in 	<i>The Guardian</i> of last Friday a tailpiece to another matter which was rather interesting. It spoke of
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Opposition attempt to increase the invalidity allowance to £1.15 for all age groups payable during the Commons Standing Committee on the National Insurance Bill yesterday."</p></blockquote>
That was rather jumping the gun I felt. The same edition had a leader comment alluding to the question of disability pensioners. We are here dealing specifically with the Amendments to the invalidity allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is pertinent, in trying to confine ourselves to that discussion, to have in mind the overall aim of where we are going and the way we assist and give people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0586">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
the right to assistance or benefits. The word "assistance" conjures up all sorts of memories of National Assistance for which people are loath to ask. In dealing with the Disability Income Group we seem to be lagging behind the Common Market countries, and although it is not strictly pertinent to our discussion to involve ourselves in any way in depth with disability or invalidity pensions, the two cannot be totally divorced. We have to have in mind where we are going as a country and where we are likely to go when we are in the Common Market. It would seem that we are lagging behind in our concept of what disabled people and invalids feel they are entitled to under National Insurance arrangements. Invalidity pensions and invalidity allowances, a kind of adjunct to the former to which the Minister is alluding, come under National Insurance entitlements rather than under notions of supplementary benefits or means-tested arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have on the Paper an Amendment which I am sure is exercising the mind of the Minister. The concept of the invalidity allowance seems to have got out of gear. What is it meant to do? It has led the Under-Secretary and the Secretary of State into the trap of wishing to do something about it and not doing anything serious about it at all. The sums of money do not mean very much except for those on the top rates. To gear them to entitlement in three age groupings raises a hornet's nest of questions. The Under-Secretary said that his Department has not had much protest about it. It is something about which we would normally make a great deal of protest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has said that he still has an open mind. He was saying that a year ago. It does not seem much of an open mind to me. He seemed to have it wrapped up that this was to be it. He charged us on this side of the Committee with a certain degree of irresponsibility in moaning about these arrangements, suggesting that we had not anything constructive to say about them, and asking how, even with the resources, we would go about using those in a different way. We do not propose to answer these questions. We are saying that as a nation we have ample resources and that there are many ways of collecting them. Taking into consideration the
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
totality of employer-employee contributions and Treasury contributions there is a three-part entity. We must improve the resources if we think the end result is desirable. As I said in my speech on old-age pensions, if that is What we desire we should put the matter right and see that we have the necessary funds. That is the substance of our Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady the Member for Melton (Miss Pike) made a contribution last week. She is not here this morning but I am sure she will not mind my referring to her speech in her absence. She alluded to the considerable amount of voluntary activity in all localities particularly to assist old people. There is a good deal of voluntary activity to assist all sorts of people who are laid by the way in whatever age group they are. Nobody would wish to discount the voluntary activity from all quarters, including the major political parties and people who are active in local authorities. I would not like to say that people in one political camp were more zealous than those in the other, though one gets the feeling that the do-gooding element is more active in the Conservative Party than in the Labour Party because the Labour Party wants to do things in a different way. We want to make substantial improvements in the entitlements, as we are showing by our Amendments to this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already pointed out the additions and obscurities and the difficulties of seeking to draw an arbitrary line when somebody is 35. I remember the Under-Secretary's argument in this regard about the family man, that the needs of someone in that situation suffering ill-health would be greater by reason of his age group, and he would need more durable goods. I do not think he made out the case, though I listened to him carefully when he was saying that there was a serious argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need would be very variable. My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones) pointed out that the most needy people in his locality seemed to be the older ones. One could push this argument round the mulberry bush till the cows come home but would never effectively resolve it. It would not be worth while getting started on invalidity allowance unless this were made an allowance which could be held in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
hand and would really be worth something. So perhaps there is some logic in the Under-Secretary's argument of last week that if this were being dealt with in substance we could deal with variables, but we are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The actual sums of money, which are 70p for one group, 35p for another and £1.15 for another, are not sums of much substance although they look sizeable in totality. The Under-Secretary has told us that the end result is £70 million. I recollect reading somewhere that the cost of the Polaris submarine is about £90 million, and it has probably gone up since I last looked at the figures. Well, at the cost of perhaps one and a half Polaris submarines, if we were not thinking in terms of keeping white elephants, we could do something serious about assisting through National Insurance measures people who are suffering invalidity. So it does not seem to me that the case has been made out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gather that this Bill has been brought in in a serious attempt to assist people without regard to means. Because it is not means-tested, it is a National Insurance entitlement. This fits into the idea that the over-80s should be given a rate regardless of means, and that is the way the thinking of the Disablement Incomes Group has developed. According to that group this is also the way the Common Market countries have developed their thinking in terms of earnings-related benefits. If we think of this invalidity assistance as being for the time being, for the period of one's invalidity, bearing in mind the possibility of returning to normal occupation after treatment, it falls down on all those grounds, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it would be better to move towards the terms of our Amendments and particularly that part which suggests that we should make some allowance for the woman over 55 and the man over 60. At first sight it would seem odd not to have regard to the fact that, rather quaintly, the national retirement age for a woman is 60 years and that for a man 65, and we shall probably allude to this later when we put our sights on the possibilty of pushing up the flat rate of State retirement pensions. There is an oddity here, particularly since women live longer than men, and it looks a bit silly because if one is under 55 one must be under 60, but of course it has regard to what is ultimately considered to be the retirement
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
age for each sex, and if it were given in that period I take it that it would have to be carried over into the period of actual State retirement. That is something which seems to make the Under-Secretary shudder because of the global sum which would be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it seems to me that the case has not been made for resisting the Opposition's Amendments. As my right hon. Friend last Thursday said, we could start off on a really good note if the Minister were prepared to concede this and say he would look at it again during the next twelve months instead of saying, as he appeared to, that he has wrapped the package up and pulled the strings tight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Tom Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like certain hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, I am sure, I find it abhorrent to, make an invidious choice between degrees of suffering, particularly on grounds of age. If one reads the OFFICIAL REPORT of the last meeting, therefore, it seems that the other side made a very much better case than we made. So yesterday morning I came back to London determined to vote for the Amendment, but I was dissuaded, because I got in touch with the Disablement Incomes Group, Mary Greaves and the Hendersons, and although they feel that the allowance is totally inadequate because resources are limited, strangely enough we seem to have found the best way of dividing up those limited resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was not the view which I as a doctor would normally take because I feel that when one gets old and is poor, because whatever one may have saved is worth very little today, and, when one worked, wages were low, hardship is being added to disillusionment, lack of optimism and isolation, so that it might very well be the older and not the younger people who needed the money. In Mary Greaves's experience it is the younger people who feel the loss of opportunity more and who are slightly more unhappy. So although the Disablement Incomes Group may quarrel over the size of the allowance it sees it as a start. However, I hope my hon. Friend will look to the future and realise that this will have to be stepped up and that we shall have to give an across-the-board and very much bigger allowance sooner or later, and that this must be only a start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other point refers to one which,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0588">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
raised by the other side, was also very good, that this might well be a wicked scheme devised by the Treasury in order to pay out less money as the years go by—pay less to the elderly, there are more of the elderly, and they are going to die off faster, so economically it is better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Disablement Income Group is going to be very persuasive both now and in the future with both political parties on these matters since it is specialist in this field, but does the hon. Gentleman not find it rather odd that, if it thinks in terms of earnings-related benefits, it ends up by accepting discrimination on the basis of age? If invalidity insurance entitlement were based on earnings-related benefits there would seem to be a contradiction, because it would end up by accepting this differential on an age basis, since one would get more according to one's earnings and these would normally be higher at 55 than at 35.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think "accepting" is the wrong word; it is prepared to tolerate this for the time being because this is a start for someone to do something about it. I do not think that it would accept this sum of money, totally inadequate as it is, for any length of time. We do not want this situation to go on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming back to the point of how long one is going to live, how fast one is going to die, and how much the Treasury will have to pay out over a long period, it is important to realise that, in the case of the disabled, death is related more to the disease than to the degree or onset of the disability. Any calculations on how long people are expected to live once they receive invalidity allowance would probably be wrong because it is extremely hard to tell, on the basis of a disability, how long a person will survive. There are many young people who will die much earlier than people who are older and have some degree of disability caused by a different disease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I shall support the Government today, somewhat reluctantly. If Mary Greaves, who really represents the union of the chairborne, feels that this Measure is a useful start, if no more, then we can support her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to put one
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
proposition to the hon. Gentleman. If anyone like Mary Greaves, whom we all respect, is faced with this position and told that the resources are limited to £x million, obviously she is forced to make a choice, but would the hon. Gentleman bear in mind that the argument put forward from this side, and which I ask him as a doctor and a Member of Parliament to consider, is that the resources this year need not be so limited, that there is room for some additional expenditure? It would be only a very small amount in global terms. For these reasons I ask him to reconsider his own decision on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought I had made myself quite plain. I hate to see the resources limited in this way, but this is a matter on which the Ministers in our Department should bully the Treasury as much as possible. I sincerely hope that they will be able to get more money out of the Treasury, but I doubt it, although I know that it would give pleasure not only to people on both sides of the Committee but also nationally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford) immediately on the best way of dividing up the limited resources but will come back to that in a moment. I want to suggest that the resources are not nearly so limited as the Opposition has been trying to say, and to go a little more carefully into what the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) said. I am sorry he is not here but I am sure that he will not mind my saying this since I know that he is fair minded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He used a very strange argument last week when he said that what really mattered was the Exchequer contribution and that the increase of only £200 million in the Exchequer contribution really was not very much when compared with huge cuts in taxes. Then he drew the example—"simple arithmetic" he called it—that it really only meant about £25 per head to each of the 8 million pensioners and other cases of disability. Really, that is taking simple arithmetic too far. because those in employment and those employing them are the taxpayers who provide the £200 million and they are also providing in their contribution a further £800 million directly, and it is one and the same thing and is coming from the same
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
pocket. So the simple arithmetic the hon. Member for Oldham, West should have been talking about was a contribution of £1,000 million, including last September and next October, to these benefits. That is the true measure of the improvement. I do not think that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will have Marley's ghost breathing down his neck on Christmas Eve this year when we consider that figure as being required to be transferred largely from those in employment to those who are retired or unable to work through disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, I think that the resources applied to invalidity pensions and invalidity allowances are nothing like as limited as hon. Members opposite have tried to show. My hon. Friend said that the total invalidity pension and invalidity allowance would be, this year, something of the order of £180 million, rising in the next tax year to about £200 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real point that the hon. Member for Oldham, West failed to make was that two years ago when his Government left office there was no invalidity allowance and no £9 million to any section. At that time they were raising £3,000 million more in taxes than we are today. That should put the matter a little more into perspective
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to come to the priorities in the workings of the invalidity allowance. This is at the core of the debate. I am glad that my hon. Friend is keeping an open mind on dividing it between the different groups, but we have to start somewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marsden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member saying that as a society we ought to be proud of this and that we are doing all we can for invalids?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can never be complacent and we can never do enough for elderly and sick people, but we have to bear in mind that there must be a redistribution of resources from those who are working to those who are less fortunate. We have to keep that balance in mind. I would like to see more in each of these cases, but it calls for a contribution from those who are in employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to argue that a flat rate for all age groups would be the best thing. It would be a lower figure for everybody, but it might well be thought that this is
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
the fairest method. The Opposition has argued that case. But is that so? I think that the Department in due course must give us a lot more information on the case histories which it is building up during this period. I can see that at the present time it is busy getting rid of the backlog and carrying out the scheme initially and that it is not ready to produce facts and figures, but in the next year, when we have another review, thanks to the Secretary of State, it would be helpful if we could have some of the information which has been stored and which must be being built up about the priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members have mentioned the psychological effect of total disability on the younger age groups. Having lived with a number of very young people who were for quite a time invalids I can speak for them. There is a big psychological effect on a young man of 20 or so who is completely disabled, but there is another factor, and that is the power of recovery and the latent determination in young people to overcome disability. It is not only they, but their families who rally round to help them overcome total disability. At a young age it is far easier than at a later age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is also true of the middle-aged. There are two remarkable examples on either side of the House, my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) and the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ashley). These are two remarkable examples of individuals who have made determined efforts to recover from total disability. That is why I think the intention to try to help these people a little more is a very good thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle), when she opened the debate, said that sometimes the oldest in society give up in despair when they suffer total disability. This may be true and whether we give them a small amount or a large amount it will not make all that difference. It is impossible to argue whether 35 is the right figure, that must be a purely subjective judgment. In the lower ages I am quite certain that to give a bit more is an encouragement to more effort and will to recover, or to make the best of one's disability. That is why I am glad my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South has come down in favour of these different priorities. Whereas a flat rate scheme would give time to iron
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
out the anomalies which will occur, it doss not give that encouragment which I would like to see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the contributions made by the back bench Members on the Government side. It seemed last week that there was every chance that the debate might end up as a dialogue between the two Front Benches. I preferred the original contribution by the hon. Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford) and I am sorry that he has succumbed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) made a contribution to the debates we had last year, but there are one or two things on which I would like to correct him. He said that we were arguing that resources were limited. This is not part of our case. Our case rests on the fact that the resources available for invalidity allowance should be increased, not that we should share the same amount in a different way. This was the point which was made earlier on this side. I understand that the hon. Member is supporting the Government in their introduction of the principle of the invalidity allowance. The Under-Secretary knows that on both sides of the Committee and throughout the House this allowance has been welcomed. In the Crossman scheme a similar provision was made. If we wanted to argue the point we could suggest that the hon. Member refer to the White Paper, Cmmd. 3883, published at that time, in which he will see we proposed an allowance on an earnings related basis, which was a better deal than the proposals in the Bill. It is no part of our argument to say that the invalidity allowance should be paid at a flat rate at the lowest level. We are saying that if we are to have it at this low level everybody should get it at the maximum level possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary suggested that we have failed to make out any case for abolishing the age of onset, but he made his speech before my hon. Friend for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) had made his contribution. My hon. Friend demolished much of the argument put forward by the Under-Secretary in defence of the three age groupings. It is not for us to justify our point of view on this, but it is up to the Government to justify the three age groups. This was a point which was raised last year, and in the debate then the
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
Under-Secretary indicated that inquiries would be carried out and we would see whether these ages were right. I do not think that the Under-Secretary's case which he elaborated last Thursday can be said to be such that he justified completely and absolutely the three age groupings or the particular age groups envisaged in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He made much play about savings, and we accept the point that, generally speaking, older people have more savings than do younger people, but there were points which he completely ignored. I have looked at the regional unemployment figures. I can quote unemployment figures in the regions. They are not only high but have been ever since I was born. The constituency which I represent has had long lasting unemployment figure without an opportunity for the people there to accumulate savings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from going back to that historical approach, if we take the present figure of the average income we find tremendous regional differences. The Digest of Statistics for 1970 indicates clearly that in Wales the average income per household per week in the year 1968-69 was 543.97p. and for the United Kingdom 624.46p. which is 15 per cent. more. One could argue that in the United Kingdom generally there were greater opportunities for saving because of the different wage levels. We also have to consider occupations. It is easier in a higher income group to save than in a low income group, and if one has always been in an occupation which has had low wages the opportunities for saving are limited. If a person has had a bad sickness record or chronic ill health he, too, cannot accumulate savings. It was nonsense for the Under-Secretary to argue this, and he did nothing for his own case when he brought forward the argument about savings. I wish he had not done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary started his case by referring to occupational pensions. We had this argument two years ago when it was indicated that occupational pension schemes for men favoured certain social groupings. This was why the Labour Government contemplated, and the present Government are contemplating ultimately, a new pension scheme because they realise that occupational pension schemes in operation at present are not adequate and do not cover a large proportion of the people. The figures are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
that 75 per cent. of male manual workers are not covered by occupational pension scheme. Some 75 per cent. of men in the public sector are, but 60 per cent. only in the private sector. Only 25 per cent. of employed women are in an occupational pension scheme and yet this argument was put forward in favour of the three ages of onset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of family commitment, and I have the statistics issued by the Department of Health and Social Security in its Annual Report, 1970. Table 93 shows that in 1970 of those under 20 only 2 per cent. had child dependants. In the 20-24 age group it was 24 per cent.; 25-29, 53 per cent.; 30-34, 67 per cent.—and it is that grouping which is to get the higher rate of invalidity allowance; 35-39, 68 per cent.; and 40-45, 60 per cent. There is a dropping off in the 45-49 group down to 46 per cent. The figures indicate that under 35 there is a family commitment which increases. From 35 to 44 years there is a greater family commitment if we measure it as being of those people with dependent children, and even those between 45 and 49 have a considerable and substantial family commitment, but are reduced to the minimum on this issue of child dependants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaiord</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member agree that a lot of the lack of child dependants in the young age group is because many disabled in this group are suffering from hereditary diseases which may exclude them from being parents? That has to be borne in mind. Would he also agree that the figure is so small that we cannot see it as a means of keeping any child. It is only a gesture at the start that something will be done in future. It is not an argument that we are going to maintain these people through invalidity allowance. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) says, it is an encouragement to the rest of the disabled, but at the moment is not a sum worth considering in the family budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously I agree that many of the younger disabled would be incapable of having children for medical and other reasons and I accept that the allowance is small and too small to be taken into account, but the question of family commitment has been stated as a
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
reason for the different age grouping, and I suggest that, if we measure family commitment by the numbers of dependant children, the fact are not in accordance with the ages chosen in the Bill, neither is the amount of money likely to ameliorate their problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are psychological factors. I do not know how much validity one can put on this. I cannot judge, but how does one measure the psychological effect of disability on various age groupings, whether it is relevant, and whether it is possible to make a broad generalisation, like that which the Under-Secretary made last year and last week?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that Amendments Nos. 75 and 76 are introduced into this discussion, and that makes it general. I support those Amendments. There are many good reasons why the invalidity allowance should be extended to men of 65 and women of 60 and if there were an Amendment designed to carry it on to those who have retired I would be prepared to support that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the last years of working life, those disabled in the five-year grouping have the same needs as those who are five years younger and yet we are completely ignoring those needs. That comes from the folly of saying, "We have to draw the line somewhere". The tragedy is that a man of 59 years and 11 months carries an allowance of 35p for life while a man a month older gets no such encouragement to enable him to cope with his invalidity. That is not a reasonable proposition, especially in the light of recent Budgets. We have a considerable increase of those between 60 and 65 who are completely outside the scope of the invalidity allowance. The figures I gave last week for 1969 suggested that 138,400 people between 60 and 65 were not entitled to invalidity allowance of any sort. I do not guarantee the figures I used, but I remember the Under-Secretary last year giving us figures and I accept that they are more likely to be correct than are mine. In a debate on last year's National Insurance Bill he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The position is that of the 415,000 people who have been on sickness benefit continually for six months or more, only 70,000, some 15 per cent., will not benefit from the allowance at one or other of the three rates."—[OFFICIAL REPORT 	<i>Standing Committee G</i>, 18th May, 1971; 	<i>c.</i> 67.]</p></blockquote>
If we take those figures to be true, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
I am not challenging them, I gather that this means 70,000 would be given the new allowance. At 35p, this would mean £1,234,000 in a full year and that seems such a small amount. No one could suggest that we are asking for massive resources to remove this anomaly. Last year the hon. Member for Wells indicated that the five-year gap provision was likely to be a gap which should disappear and which he hoped would soon disappear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noted the figure of 70,000 which has been attributed to the Under-Secretary, but I gather from a letter which the Under-Secretary sent to my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle), and a copy of which is in the hands of all Members of the Committee, that the present figure is not 70,000, as it apparently was last year, but has risen to 75,000. The Under-Secretary nods at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we are talking of the vast resources of the nation the difference is not great, so long as we are not one of the extra 5,000 who are excluded. If we accept that figure, the cost of paying the invalidity allowance at 35p would be something like £1¼ million, and if we are talking of this in terms of resources the sum is so small as to be hardly worth mentioning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent a coal mining area and I am particularly concerned with the large numbers of ex-miners. I have been looking up the number of miners drawing pneumoconiosis benefits of varying sorts throughout the year. In that industry, in the group from 60 to 64 years, we find the largest number of people and yet we are ignoring just that five-year grouping by the cut-off at 60 for men. The figures show that there are 20 between 30 and 34 who draw benefit for pneumoconiosis; 2,445 between 45 and 49 years; 6,454 between 55 and 59 years; and in the group we are excluding, from 60 to 64 years still working in collieries, 7,849. The largest number are being excluded from the benefits of the invalidity allowance. This oldest age group, from 60 to 64, by virtue of the fact that they have been in employment—or at least, large numbers of them—for a longer period will be the group which has made the greatest contribution both to the National Insurance Fund and, by taxation, to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
nation, and also by their own efforts in the creation of wealth for the community at large. This group forms the largest five-year grouping and has made the greatest contribuition. Yet this is the group which is deliberately excluded from this benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that one explanation why the payment need not or should not be made during this five-year cut-off period is that that would be an incentive for people in that group to cheat, because the benefit would be carried into retirement. We should not make such suggestions unless we can prove them, and I would have thought that any suggestion that this older age group would take this as an incentive to cheat is unproven. I find it insulting to the long-term and older sick people. In order to qualify they have to be sick for more than six months, and the accusation is, therefore, a reflection on the medical profession who have to issue certificates and have to certify illness for the six months before these people are entitled to invalidity allowance. It is also a partial reflection on the doctors attached to the Department who have to certify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Under-Secretary will say that there is nothing immutable about the five-year period, and I hope that he will have second thoughts on this and that backbench hon. Members opposite will continue to prod and to push their Government, as we had to ours, and that we can get the principle of these Amendments accepted and get rid of the absurdity of this onset allowance as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are having an interesting debate on important Amendments and this side of the Committee welcomes the interventions by the hon.

Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen), who has explained to the Committee, and to the House on one occasion a time ago, that he is a war disability pensioner. We listened with respect to their contributions. Each has experience, although of a different kind, of the matters we are discussing. An Opposition always welcomes contributions from the back benches on the Government side during Committee proceedings.

This, fortunately, is not a Bill which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
the Opposition has voted against on Second Reading, or on which the Opposition seeks unduly to prolong the deliberations in Committee. We shall exercise our democratic rights to discuss important topics fully, but we shall not engage in an exercise to hold up the Bill. I say with the greatest kindness how much we would welcome contributions from hon. Members opposite. The hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Norman Lamont) smiles at that, but whether or not there are contributions from them will not make our deliberations longer or shorter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames had a distinguished predecessor, a right hon. Gentleman respected on all sides, who had deep knowledge of pension matters. The Under-Secretary smiles, but he knows that if that former right hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames had been here he would not have sat through Committee smiling at the Opposition comments on a National Insurance Measure: he would have had something to say; and I hope that the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames will feel able to make a contribution to our discussion of these Amendments.

I notice with some misgivings that the hon. Gentleman the Member for Billericay (Mr. McCrindle) is missing. The hon. Gentleman has expert knowledge on these matters. He has informed the House that he is a pensions consultant in the private sector. The private occupational pension is so often missing when people retire in this country; so in this Committee this morning, when we need advice, guidance and the expertise of a private pensions consultant, he is not

here. He has left us and gone to other pastures. I hope we shall find him in the Committee making a contribution a little later on.

As my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones) pointed out, we are now discussing not only Amendments Nos. 2 and 10 which were introduced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) last week but also two other Amendments which my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, West was the first hon. Member on this Committee to deal with this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[Sir STEPHEN MCADDEN in the Chair.]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate falls into two parts. First, the section on which there has already been some discussion, that of what my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn described as the present trinity of rates for the invalidity allowance and the desirability of replacing them with one new higher rate. We are also discussing and seeking to change the existing arrangements under which a man over 60 on the qualifying date, or a woman over 55 on the qualifying date, does not receive invalidity allowance. The purpose of Amendments 75 and 76 is so to amend the Bill that the invalidity allowance will become payable to men and women where on the qualifying date they are over the age on which the allowance is presently payable but under the age at which the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
State retirement pension is payable, 65 for men and 60 for women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the Amendments on women between 55 and 60, and men between 60 and 65, is that they would for the first time, as they do not under the existing legislation—and as they do not under this Bill as it now stands—be entitled to an invalidity allowance. In addition they would become entitled to the invalidity allowance at the full rate which, in the Schedule as it stands, is £1.15 and which, under the Amendments which we shall be discussing later, would be put at a higher figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Under-Secretary explained during the debates on the National Insurance Bill, 1971, once an invalidity allowance becomes payable at a rate it remains at that rate as the person gets older and it still is payable at that rate even when that man or woman has gone over the age of 60 for the woman or 65 for the man. That is the proposition we are putting forward in Amendments 75 and 76, in addition to the Amendments Nos. 2 and 10 which seek to establish the payment of one rate of invalidity allowance, the higher rate, as it exists at the moment, rather than the three which were set down in earlier legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, West gave us some interesting illustrations of the situation in this constituency. He dealt with the elderly. He showed what all of us know, having looked at the statistics which are available. The onset of chronic illness or invalidity as defined in this Bill, for the purposes of this Bill, is more likely to occur at an older than at a younger age. In the consideration of the National Insurance Act, 1971, my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mrs. Shirley Williams) pointed this out. There is no need for me to repeat those figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to say this in a debate where from the Government side the available financial resources have been an important part of the case. By cutting off these categories of men and women, between 55 and 60 for women and 60 and 65 for men, the Government are saving a substantial amount of money within the context of the invalidity scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an intervention during the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, West I suggested, and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
Under-Secretary confirmed, that there were currently 75,000 invalidity pensioners who do not receive any invalidity allowance because the onset of their relevant incapacity was within five years of minimum pension age. We are pleading this morning not only for the payment of the higher rate of allowance for the older people but, in addition, for the 75,000 older people. That is a separate and different proposition. I hope the hon. Member for Norwich, South will consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government insist on rejecting, with back bench support, Amendments Nos. 2 and 10 they can have a look at Amendments 75 and 76 separately. One does not have to accept the four Amendments in their entirety. One can accept either of the two groupings. The extra cost is the question that we must deal with once again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was pointed out last week—I am interpreting a copy of the letter which the Under-Secretary sent to my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn—that the total cost of accepting all those Amendments would be £15 million gross 	<i>or</i> £10 million net. If the 75,000 people are paid the allowance at the full figure—that is £1.15—the net cost would be about £3 million. I ask hon. Gentlemen opposite who are sympathetic to the matter to examine this proposition. Perhaps the Government are not prepared to accept payment at the full figure. I understand the reasoning of the hon. Member for Norwich, South although I disagree with it. If the people between 60 and 65 in the case of men, and between 50 and 55 in the case of women, were paid the invalidity allowance at the lower rate, which is not proposed at £1.15 but is proposed at the lower figure of 35p, then the cost there would not be anything like £3 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Mr. Paul Dean)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figures which I gave in reply to this point, about which we became somewhat confused at the last meeting, were £15 million gross, £10 million net. That is the invalidity allowance at the full rate, not at the 30p rate for the 75,000 people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The cost of paying them 35p would be substantially less.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be the cost of what the hon. Member wants to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would be the cost of paying the 75,000 people at 35p? It would be a matter of multiplying 75,000 by 35 by 52 weeks. It is a much smaller sum of money. I hope that hon. Gentlemen opposite will consider whether they can push their Government in this direction. I would hope we could get this during this year. It is not unusual for Governments to accept small Amendment's of this kind. If we cannot do that, I would hope that there can be pressure to include these people who are missed out because of their age on the qualifying date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Norwich, South explained the views of Mary Greaves. The situation is this. I said almost this to the hon. Gentleman in an earlier intervention. If one is told there is no elasticity in the resources available one must take one's choice. One must choose one's priorities with no elasticity. One is forced to a decision of one kind or another. I understand the situation which Mary Greaves has probably been driven into. The hon. Gentleman, who is a doctor, probably has views other than those which Mary Greaves has been pushed into expressing to him by what she understands to be the Treasury situation. The hon. Gentleman agrees with me on the broader proposition. I am sure he would agree, on Amendments Nos. 75 and 76, that we ought to be able to help these people and push the Treasury, when one looks at what this Secretary of State has got. Any impartial observer looking at how this Secretary of State has operated on the Treasury, even though doing it at a good time with a bad Treasury, would say that he had done rather well. I am referring to what he got from the Treasury and not his policy decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend must not overstate the case.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Getting rather more blood out of the stone than some Ministers do. Therefore one assumes that the hon. Gentleman will league up with me. It is not a party political matter at all. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can be pushed into accepting Amendments Nos. 75 and 76. I have been in the Department where the present Minister is. This is not the kind of thing where there is major political mileage at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that we should help this age group at the rate of 35p. We are damaging no one; we are helping a very small number of people, 75,000 who really need some help. Furthermore, there are no administrative problems. I can understand anyone taking the view on the attendance allowance that we are driven into a situation where we have to phase the introduction of the expansion of the attendance allowance. There are major problems of administration, definition and medical manpower, but in this case we can pay the 35p at the higher rate without any difficulties at all. Therefore there is no reason why we should not help those people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all seen Ministers persuaded into doing minor things before. One understands that Ministers cannot be pushed into major changes of policies in Committees. If we do they change the whole thing back on Report. Can hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Stuttaford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One point which we might bring out is hypothermia in the elderly. These will not be those who are already receiving supplementary benefit. When the Minister has made calculations I think he has omitted those who are receiving supplementary benefit. This is the difference between those who are receiving supplementary benefit and those not receiving it. We should think in terms of hypothermia and those not getting any fuel allowance, those who are crippled and cold and unable to move around. This is an important point. Older people suffer from hypothermia and the only
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
people who get a fuel allowance are those who are getting a supplementary pension. These are another group who might get a fuel allowance and who do not get a supplementary allowance. If we accept Amendments Nos. 75 and 76 this will be a way of giving additional money to those who need it in order that they may keep warm in wintertime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I will treat it with the seriousness and degree of non-party policy which it deserves. Some of those people between 60 and 65 could be receiving supplementary benefit. They will be getting the invalidity pension of £6.75 with no allowance on top, so some could be on supplementary benefit, but some will not be. We know that the present situation regarding the fuel allowance is not satisfactory. The Minister himself and every Member of this Committee knows that. It is a question of modifying the system, the amount of resources available. Not only is the size of the fuel allowance unsatisfactory but the difference between that and the long term addition is unsatisfactory. We would ask the Under-Secretary, if he will not accept Amendments 2 and 10, to look at Nos. 75 and 76. They are modest Amendments which could do a great deal of good for a small amount of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at what the Government give us on this matter. I have looked up the debates on the Bill last year to see what the Minister had to say about it. He points out that the invalidity allowance which is paid in three rates is on top of the invalidity pension. He pointed out again this year that the invalidity pension has also been put up. The difficulty is this. First of all his invalidity pension—and I come to the point raised by the hon. Member for Wells—is a flat rate benefit. The Under-Secretary can say, as he said last year, "Yes, but the earnings-related benefit which the Cross-man scheme sought to introduce took some years to build up". If we can consider the general question of the payment of an invalidity pension to someone with chronic sickness there are very strong arguments, in the kind of society in which we live, that there should be a relationship between the standard of living of individuals receiving that pension, the situation when they are forced to retire
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
through old age or invalidity, and their situation when they were at work and receiving a wage or salary. The hon. Member for Billericay knows this better than anyone else. That is the whole purpose of a decent earnings-related pension. There should be a relationship between earnings at work and the income on re-timement and, for ihe purpose of this Amendment, when one becomes chronically sick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Gentleman says that we are not considering in these Amendments an invalidity allowance of one rate or another or whether the invalidity allowance should be paid to the categories 60 to 65, and uses as an argument the fact that the invalidity pension has been increased from £6 to £6.75, there are a number of things which the hon. Gentleman is not saying increased at a time of rapid inflation; increase of a flat-rate pension, and it still remains a flat-rate pension, ignoring long years of payment into the State National Insurance scheme, and at the end of the day being paid an invalidity pension which, for most people, is below supplementary benefits standard. It is a pension which is not big enough to live on without other means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government and the whole of the country recognise that, so that the invalidity pensioner, even with his increase, still has to go for means-tested benefits. It is in that context that we have to consider the defence of the Under-Secretary in saying that it is not the invalidity allowance which is important, it has only been put up 5p, 10p, or 15p, it is the other payment. I am not criticising the increase. I am criticising the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While there is a flat-rate system which pays an invalidity pension which is not big enough to live on and people with only that income have to ask for means-tested benefit how can we say that this is an argument for not paying an invalidity allowance for women between 55 and 60 and men between 60 and 65, and how can we say that this is an argument for not putting up the invalidity allowance by more than 5p, 10p and 15p which is the purpose of Amendments Nos. 2 and 10? This undermines the whole basic argument used by the Minister and his Department, because the National Insurance system is inadequate and we have been driven into earnings-related contributions of one kind or another. People are paying earnings-related con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
tributions for flat-rate benefits, and they are getting for earnings-related contributions a flat-rate benefit which the State recognises is not enough to live on. That argument cannot be used for refusing an invalidity allowance to this older group of people if we have a system of National Insurance which in itself is so ineffective. The Minister goes on to use a further series of arguments as to why these older people should not get an invalidity allowance and why there should be this trinity of reducing the invalidity allowance for people according to age. He says that older people are likely to have savings, and I quote from his speech to the Standing Committee considering the National Insurance Bill last year:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We must avoid getting into a position in which people who are close to the age of retirement may have a substantially different level of benefit, depending on whether they qualify for an age-of-onset allowance. We clearly have to watch the anomalies which would be created were we to go right up to the age of retirement in awarding those allowances".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee G</i>, 18th May, 1971; c. 55 and 56.]</p></blockquote>
Is the Minister so sold on flat-rate benefits? Are there not circumstances in which these old people should be getting some addition to the flat-rate pension? He also said that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the nearer people get to retirement, the greater their chances are of having savings, of having occupational pensions and breakdown pensions available to them. Therefore, in that sense the financial need tends to diminish with those who become chronically sick at an older age".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee G</i>, 18th May, 1971; c. 56.]</p></blockquote>
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. Gentleman that it is not true. He must not make generalisations of that kind. There is not enough evidence to suggest it. On the contrary, the evidence we have suggests that this is not the case. To dissect his statement a little, it is true that some people will have occupational pensions and some will have good occupational pensions, we all recognise that, but they are in a minority. Surely we have to consider the generality of people, people with no occupational pensions at all; people like my father, who worked a lifetime down the mines and came out with an occupational pension of £1 a week, which was later increased to 30s. a week. That is the kind of occupational pension which one has to consider. It is true that more people now have occupational pensions, and I want
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
to see people with good occupational pensions; good occupational pension schemes are highly prized and worth having, but so many of them are not good. So we are not talking only about large numbers of manual workers and others with no occupational pension schemes at all, but about lots of people who for the purpose of classification, have got such schemes but whose schemes are pathetic. I know from the Government's actuaries' figures which I have seen that even at the end of the century on present trends large numbers of retirement households will still be without an occupation pension of any kind. The hon. Gentleman knows how to use generalisations, he is adept at it. He says that some people have occupational schemes; but a lot have not, and a lot who have them have very poor ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then the hon. Gentleman says that the chances of having savings are higher for the older. There seems to be contradictory evidence on this. The hon. Gentleman quoted a survey which had been done, a very small and selective survey, from which there was some indication that as people get older some of them have some savings. It is true that if one has the opportunity one saves something for one's old age, or has a bit of insurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend represents, as do all of us on this side of the Committee, the poorer people in the community generally. Does he come across in his own constituency old people who have saved a bit of money and it is in the Post Office but they are scared to touch it because they do not know how long they will live, so that often they die and leave a couple of hundred in the bank to be squabbled over by their children? They are scared to spend it as they could if they had a decent system of allowances and a decent pension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. Obviously some people have savings for their old age, but certainly in the kind of area which I represent and in which I was born—and I think my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, West and my other hon. Friends in this Committee have similar experience—most people do not have any savings at all because the people who are retired
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0598">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
now are those who were working in the 'twenties and' thirties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. A. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to contradict the hon. Gentleman, and clearly it is an exaggeration to say that a great many people in the category to which he refers have large savings. That is not true and I accept that. However, on a rather narrow point, and as someone who has been involved in the industrial life assurance field in such areas as he and his hon. Friends represent, I would say that I think he has underestimated the sense of thrift that exists among ordinary people who also have such a feeling of independence that they find industrial life insurance a mainstay. That may not represent very substantial savings, but there is an element of truth in what my hon. Friend said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope I have not been misrepresenting the Under-Secretary, because I agree that there is an element of truth in what he has been saying, but possibly in the kind of industrial areas I come from there is more truth in what I am saying. I have not looked this up, but I think the hon. Gentleman would find that the pattern in working class areas, certainly up to very recent years, has been one of life assurance. If we are talking about policies which are payable at 60 or 65, that is something which developed during the 'fifties and' sixties and it is one explanation for the growth of the insurance company in those areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may like to know that in this country, as distinct from the United States, far more of the policies taken out are endowment-type policies, under which the amount of savings is paid out at a particular time, usually at age 65, whereas in America they buy death cover. So I think the position is almost exactly the opposite of what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Most policies in this country would be payable in a lump sum at 60 or 65.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying what the hon. Gentleman thinks I am saying. I agree with him. I was saying that the policies of older people in many parts of the country are payable on death. The trend now is for something which can be drawn out while people are still alive and as those policies mature it will become
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
increasingly so. However, a few hundreds pounds at times such as this of rapid inflation these are no help at all. It is certainly the case that very large numbers of people in their sixties and older, the people we are discussing here, people from areas of high unemployment and low wages, have never had an opportunity to save.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the reasons, there are certainly still large numbers of people without any savings, and I really cannot accept that the older a person is the more likely he is to have savings big enough to afford any useful cushioning, and I am talking of the whole of the country. So when the hon. Gentleman talks about occupational pensions and savings and breakdown pensions, of course there is an element of truth, but I hope I can take the Committee with me in saying that there are still very large numbers of people—in my submission, the majority of people in the country—who do not have that kind of protection to any significant extent. Therefore the argument that there should be age grading and that older people should be cut out altogether does not stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I have a few brief comments on what was said earlier in the debate on Amendments Nos. 2 and 10 by which we seek to establish that all invalidity allowances will be paid at the higher rate whatever the age at the qualifying date. The Under-Secretary explained that it was really a question of priority of resources, that we should consider these benefits in relation to all the other benefits. The hon. Lady the Member for Melton (Miss Pike) pointed out that people get help from their own families and from the social services, although she admitted that these things, useful though they are, are no substitute for money. I do not complain of a Government having priorities in the allocation of resources. I complain about the priorities and the manner in which this Government are allocating their resources, but I am not dealing with that broader question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would only say to the hon. Gentleman that the Amendments which we are putting forward—which he can accept, or some of which he can accept—are Amendments which the Government, the taxpayer, the nation, can afford, particularly in a year in which the Chancellor has felt able to introduce the kind of Budget he has. When the hon. Gentleman
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0599">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
the Member for Wells points out that additional expenditure is about £1,000 million, I accept this; this is the kind of announcement made by Governments in various areas of their policy from one year to another. At a time of appalling inflation which the Government have apparently no ability to deal with, put in this context, in which these people receiving invalidity allowances are entitled to an increase of 15p, 10p, or 5p—and it is not for me to talk about beef prices although something was said about them to illustrate a point last week—when a wealthy nation can talk about an increase of £1,000 million, can we not afford that, cannot the priorities be changed a little if necessary? It is not merely priorities within the H.S.S. or priorities in other Departments which come into this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can we not really accept Amendments Nos. 2 and 10? If the Government cannot do that, can we not do something for these 75,000 people between the ages of 55 and 60, for women, and 60 and 65 for men? When we consider the present level of prices and how these people on these limited incoms are affected, when we consider the priorities which have been accepted by the Chancellor in his Budget, which my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) dissected so well in his speech last Thursday, when we consider that this is a year in which the Government, if they wished, could help—and there will be years in which it will be far less easy to do something—do the Government not feel themselves able to amend the attitude they adopted on Tuesday?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel sorry for the Under-Secretary because he has got the worst of the argument, but he can defend himself more than adequately, and there is some room for movement here. I hope he will accept Amendments Nos. 2 and 10 but, if he does not, I hope he will accept Amendments 75 and 76, for 75,000 old, disabled men and women. All we would give them, if he did not accept No. 2 and No. 10, would be 35p a week and that would be very helpful for them this winter. I call on hon. Gentlemen on both sides of the Committee to support these Amendments Nos. 75 and 76, so that we can give assistance to 75,000 people who really need it. We would not be giving them very much, and it would not cost us very much, but it would be the right thing to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the whole Com-

mittee is very glad to see the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. O'Malley) back in his place and in his usual good form, but in spite of the assistance from his hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) he did not manage to keep him out of the trough in which he fell when he admitted that my right hon. Friend had done very well in the money he had obtained from the Treasury for social service benefits and, indeed, for the Health Service as a whole. I am grateful to the hon. Member for that admission. It is an immensely important one, because it cuts the ground right from under his feet in the argument he has been using in favour of the two Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have debated these important Amendments for nearly two Sittings. I am in no sense complaining, nor am I complaining about the pressure from my hon. Friends and the Opposition to do more. The whole Committee will recognise that what we call civilian disability is a subject which, alas, we have sadly neglected for far too long. This has been the fault of both the main political parties. We are now making progress at long last, and I think we can fairly claim that a good deal of progress has been made during the past two years in remedying omissions which existed before. Having said that, let me assure the Committee that we are only a very short way along a road which we are as anxious as is the Opposition to proceed along as fast and as far as we can within the limits of the resources available to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will refer briefly to the first series of Amendments which we discussed a good deal at the last Sitting. These are concerned with the age of onset and whether, given the limited resources, it is desirable to have an age of onset or whether it is better to have an invalidity allowance which is the same for everybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Opposition in most of their speeches gave us at least two marks out of three. The hon. Member for Fife, West gave two and a half marks—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, two out of three. There was little argument from the Opposition that when one takes the criterion of the psychological shock, the inability
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0600">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
to enjoy life, or when one takes the criterion of the commitment of the people concerned, the effect is that disability hits harder at the younger ages and that it hits those whose commitments are likely to be greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones) made one point when he said that very often by the time that parents are about 35 their children are at the most expensive age, because they are going into their teens. I accept that this is the case in some instances, but I think he will accept that these children have also got to the age where the mother, who earlier had to be in the home and not able to go out to work because the children needed a great deal of care and attention, is able, if employment opportunities are there, to seek work and, therefore, supplement the family income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In saying this in regard to the psychological point and the point with regard to commitment, I am not making a statement which can be proved scientifically. I am talking about relativities. I do not think anybody in the Committee seriously contests that on these two grounds the impact on the younger age groups is not greater than on the older age groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The greatest difference was expressed about the other criterion I used, namely, whether older people would tend to have greater resources. Here again the hon. Member for Rotherham and many of his hon. Friends were less than fair when they were trying to suggest that I claimed that all elderly people had savings and had resources. I was not claiming that at all; I was saying that the likelihood is that elderly people will tend to have more resources than younger people. There is little doubt that this is true. I will quote from the survey done on behalf of the National Savings Movement in 1968. It shrowed clearly that this is the relative position. Equally, the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) on the last occasion quoted some figures from the Department of Employment 	<i>Gazette</i> of August, 1971, but even his figures bear out my argument and not his, and the figures he used were selectively taken from the group whose earnings were £15 to £17. We should consider figures from the 	<i>Gazette</i> for all categories concerned. For male manual workers the coverage in occupational pension schemes for the 21 to 24 age group was 20 per cent; for
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
the 40 to 44 age group it was 55 per cent. This stands to reason. Occupational pension schemes usually take some time to mature, and it is almost inevitable that older people will have a greater range of cover than people of a younger age. For non-manual workers the coverage in the 21 to 24 age group was 60 per cent; the coverage in the 40 to 44 age group was 75 per cent. I am not claiming that these figures are conclusive. All I am saying is that they suggest strongly, as I think all one's personal experience would suggest, that the older people will tend to have a greater stake and greater rights in occupational pension schemes than will younger people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Instead of these generalities which we hear repeated year in and year out, is it possible for the Ministry to undertake some real research to show not how many old people have savings or are covered by occupational pension schemes but how many old disabled people are receiving invalidity allowances? Then many of our arguments could be resolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figures I am quoting are not generalities but are hard facts as to the amount of savings which people have. As to the other point, I entirely accept that we do not know anything like enough, and one of the reasons why this is so is that we have neglected this area in the past. One learns far more about what the needs are by moving in with a scheme than one does by a whole range of academic research. I am not casting doubt on research, which is valuable, but I am saying that we are learning from experience with invalidity allowances and attendance allowances. It is early days, and we will learn a great deal more about where the most pressing needs are, and this will guide us as to the way these allowances will go in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend be prepared at some stage to present to the House some of the information which the Department is now getting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gladly respond to my hon. Friend's point on that. It will take a little time before information becomes available. Even for the attendance allowance it is early days yet, and it has not been going for 12 months. We do not know enough to provide information which is reliable and not misleading. We
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
intend to fill the gaps in our knowledge as soon as we can, so that we can be guided as to future policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford) previously had some doubts whether the age of onset was the right approach given the limited resources available. I am glad that he feels that this is right, at any rate in the knowledge which we have at the present time, and having talked to someone who has a great range of experience and who, if I may say so, has a very balanced judgment on disability and the needs of the disabled, namely, Mary Greaves of DIG. I was glad to hear my hon. Friend quoting her judgment, given the resources available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one were to do what the Opposition is suggesting, namely, have one level of allowance, unless one were to spend more money, the effect would be that 60,000 at present getting the middle rate of allowance would have to get 15p a week less than proposed in the Bill and 55,000, namely, the under-35s, would have to get 60p a week less. These are not arguments which the Opposition has addressed itself to. It has said that what we must do is spend more money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that on the basis of likely resources, likely commitments, and the psychological impact, we think it right to concentrate the larger allowances where the need is likely to be greatest, namely, where the onset of incapacity takes place at the younger ages. This identification of needs is one of the reasons we have been able in a comparatively short time to meet many urgent needs where most good can be done in the time available to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me assure the Committee again that our minds are open on this, and that we intend to learn by experience; but nothing we have learned since the allowance came into operation last September, and nothing which has been said in the Committee, has suggested to me that we have got this wrong, given the resources available. None the less, I assure the Committee that this is not being stubborn or pigheaded. We will watch the working of this allowance with intense care, and if, in the light of experience, it appears that we are wrong, or that there ought to be one allowance instead of steps, the necessary changes can be made. All I am saying is that at the moment the case has not been made
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will now turn to the second group of Amendments, which are concerned with whether, within five years of retirement age, a person who at the present time does not get an invalidity allowance ought to have one. As the hon. Member for Rotherham said, this is another point which was discussed last year. Here one has to take into account the anomalies which would arise if the invalidity allowance were to go right up to retirement age. I do not think he took sufficiently into account the fact that once an invalidity allowance is awarded it remains for life, or as long as the sickness remains. Of course, if the person happily becomes cured the allowance stops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one were to have an invalidity allowance right up to retirement age or the day before retirement age one would get into the position where a person who was 64 years and 11 months would be entitled to an allowance whereas a person of 65 and one month would not. This is the sort of anomaly which would be created by the suggestion which the hon. Gentleman is making. I am not for one moment suggesting that by taking five years before retirement age one is not creating some sort of difficulty. Of course one is. That is inevitable in an approach of this kind, and I freely admit that it is one disadvantage of such an approach, but equally, to do as he suggested would create much greater difficulties just each side of retirement age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look a little more at the help given to these 75,000 invalidity pensioners who are not getting invalidity allowance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister moves on to a new part of his argument, may I deal with his argument that anomalies would be created because a man could receive invalidity allowance by qualifying at 64 years and 11 months—or in the case of a woman, 59 years and 11 months? That is the kind of situation which exists throughout the National Insurance system. It was one reason why the widows' allowance was amended, so that one got scaled-down allowances because of age. Scaled-down allowances would fit neatly into the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot win. One moment the hon. Member is asking for one allowance for everybody and now he is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0602">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
saying that a scaled-down allowance would remove the hard line as people get near retirement age. He must decide which horse he is backing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Substantial help is being made available for these groups. They are entitled to invalidity pension, which is being increased by 75p for a single person and £1.20 for a married person. If they have working wives they come under a much more favourable earnings rule and all will benefit in future from the annual review, while those on supplementary benefit will benefit from the improved supplementary benefit, including the heating allowance which my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South mentioned. Many—I do not want to overstate the case—will have some occupational provision. The fact of the matter is that these allowances are far more effective in dealing with need today than the proposals the hon. Gentleman referred to in the Cross-man scheme in the last Parliament, because these allowances mature at once. They mature, if the Committee agrees, in October this year for all those eligible, whereas the allowances to which he referred mature slowly over a period of years. That is the advantage of this approach to disability: making allowances available through National Insurance or supplementary benefit where there is no question of a long period of maturity and they can be put into operation straightaway. As my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. McCrindle) said with his experience of pension matters, many take out endowment policies which mature at 60 or 65, or something of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For practical reasons, therefore, and because of the help being made available in other parts of the Bill for invalids and pensioners one can see that in the light of current experience we have the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other factor is some time in the future. It shows that we are not only looking at disability through the various allowances in this Clause and in other parts of the Bill. That is the tax credit arrangements foreshadowed by the Chancellor in the Budget, which will be followed fairlv soon by the publication of a Green Paper which will give the House a full opportunity to debate the possibilities. One of the effects of the tax credit arrangement will be that people
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
like the disabled will, in many cases, be much less dependent on supplementary benefit than they are at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leaves the main Opposition argument, that we should be spending more. The hon. Member for Southall (Mr. Bid-well) was frank enough to admit that they were not interested in how we are locating resources but only in getting more resources, and the hon. Member for Rhondda, West made much the same point, as did the hon. Member for Fife, West in the last debate. He was good enough at the last Sitting to say that the Opposition believed
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is a kind of political auction"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D</i>, 8th June, 1972; 	<i>c.</i> 26.]</p></blockquote>
I am not complaining, but that is really what these Amendments are about. When the hon. Gentleman says that it is only a few more million we have to take into account on this side of the Committee not only this Amendment, which, incidentally, would about double the cost, but all the other Amendments which the Opposition has put down. I keep a running total of where we are getting and we have already got an additional bill of more than £800 million a year on top of the substantial increase of about £500 million a year already in the Bill. How right was my hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) when he pointed out, in referring to the speech of the hon. Member for Oldham, West, about the Exchequer contribution, that it all comes out of the same pocket—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —whether it is the taxpayers' pocket or the contributors' pocket. The Opposition has now put in a bid in this, and their seven Amendments would mean an increase in contributions of at least 25p for the £30 a week man, of 49p for the £40 a week man, and 67p for the £48 a week man on top of the increases in the Bill. That would mean, if the Opposition were to have its way, that the £48 a week man, at the ceiling, would be paying an increase in contributions of well over £1 a week. When these figures are bandied about, one has to consider the inflationary effect of enormous increases of this kind, the effect on wage claims, and the dreary round of inflation undermining the pension and other benefits involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the fascinating figures of the likely increase in weekly contributions and the calculations involved in arriving at them, can the Minister indicate whether he has assumed no increase in Exchequer contributions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I assumed an increase on the same ratio of Exchequer contribution as the increase by the previous Administration and by this Administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dishonest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am applying this on the same ratio, the 18 per cent. to which the previous Administration committed themselves and the 18 per cent. which is in this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The same 18 per cent. There is no increase in Exchequer contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What it means, too, is that we have in two years managed to produce a package for the disabled, and that is the context in which the Amendment should be seen. It includes invalidity pension and the new invalidity allowance to be reviewed annually and both increased in the Schedule; the higher rates of dependant's allowance; the preference for the dependents of the disabled of no less than £1.20 for each child; the improvement in the earnings rule for working wives of disability pensioners; attendance allowance and its extension in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to this Committee that this is substantial progress in a short period, progress on which we are determined to build, and in that context I hope the Oppositon, having heard this long and useful debate, will not feel it appropriate to divide the Committee, but, if it does, I would advise the Committee to reject the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Up to now we have had a good-tempered Committee and a well-informed and humane debate, conducted so far, as we have a right to expect, on a non-party basis. We have had many contributions from both sides, which is unusual in most Committees, as my hon. Friend remarked. In Committees, Government hon. Members are usually told to sit tight, say nowt and to vote when the occasion arises. That is their job and nothing else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was, therefore, sorry to note the stunning silence of the hon. Member for Liver-
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
pool, Garston (Mr. Fortescue). He has an enormous working knowledge of the problems we are discussing. He was extremely active in Opposition, as my hon. Friend will bear out, but now he sits like a gagged Trappist monk. I know he is a Whip, but I am very much against the tradition of Whips sitting silent. He is a Member of the Committee and should give us the benefit of his experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. O'Malley) spoke as usual with great compassion and experience as an ex-Minister in this sphere. I was more than somewhat alarmed when he appeared to wax too enthusiastic about the successes of the Secretary of State for Social Services in performing the modern twentieth century miracle of getting blood out of a Treasury stone. He has not. The Under-Secretary made great play of this, as I thought he would, and it is important to get the facts on the record. I shall put some on the record in due course. We are redistributing resources here, not from the taxpayer to the underprivileged, but from one set of workers to another set, and that has little to do with the Treasury at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend, Ministers and several hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. McCrindle), referred to the savings of older people, of working people. We take different lines on the two sides of the House and the two sides of this Committee. I will come to that later, but whatever savings working people have made over the last 20 to 30 years, they have been substantially eroded under all Governments by inflation since 1939. We all get letters to that effect. People have saved over 20 or 30 years hoping to have a reasonably comfortable old age. They find they cannot have it. They have to lean heavily on the provision that we in the House make in the social security field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming to the Minister's speech, we want to vote. We are going to have two votes. We intend to vote on two of these Amendments before 1 o'clock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under successive Governments, progress has been made in remedying many omissions of the under-privileged, the handicapped, the mentally handicapped, the physically handicapped, and the economically handicapped in every other way. That is the hallmark of any society
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0604">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
which claims to be civilised. We ought to be proud of it. That is one of the reasons why this Committee is less party political than others. That is right and proper. The Minister must understand that when I referred to a political auction I meant it in the best possible sense. The only way we can make progress in this or any other field is for one party—and particularly an Opposition party—to seek to convince the electorate that it would do better than the party in office. There is nothing wrong, sinister or dishonest about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was guilty of the same when sitting as Minister. He counted the cost of the proposals put forward by the then Tory Opposition in the same way that we have costed all this. I remember the present Leader of the Opposition, soon to be Prime Minister, said we were costing all the proposals that the Tory Opposition were putting forward in various fields. Their social conscience was never more acute than when they were on the Opposition benches between 1964 and 1970. I make no complaint about that. Nor should they make any complaints when we put forward these Amendments. They can shoot them down on the grounds of cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must not repeat the generalisations in which he engaged when he made his original speech on these Amendments and the arguments which he has repeated. I agreed with him that the psychological effect of disablement must be greater on the younger people. One cannot prove that. The medical representative may have knowledge of that, from his practical experience. I do not think, however, it could be quantitatively measured. It is a matter of common sense that a younger person who suddenly finds himself disabled, and unable to earn his living, will suffer a more traumatic experience than a man of 60 who finds himself in the same situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to my own parents, now both dead. I can never remember when they had a holiday, not even a day at the sea. My father was a coal miner, like the fathers of my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham and my hon. Friend the Member for the Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones). We speak from that practical experience of working class families not shared by the great majority of Conservative Members. I do not blame them for that. No blame is attached to it. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
state it as a bare fact. There are individual exceptions, but the broad generality is true. Neither my father nor my mother smoked or drank. They did not have any expensive habits. When they died there was nothing left to squabble over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Billericay said the merit of thrift is an instinct within working class people. Of course it is; but they could not satisfy it. I used to go to the colliery office as a schoolboy in the 1930s and draw my father's pay. We are talking about these people today. The people of 65 today were working in the 1930s. What were their maximum earnings in the 1930s? I can remember going to the colliery office. One was lucky if one's father had worked three shifts in the week. That was regarded as full employment. The minimum wage was 6s. 8½d. I went to the colliery office and drew my father's pay of £1 a week—he was fully employed as a coalminer—to keep six of us at home, four boys and my father and mother. If the hon. Gentleman the Member for Billericay is going to tell us that those men, now in their 60s and 70s, have got savings to fall back on, I say he is talking arrant rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not suggest during my earlier intervention that I had the practical living experience to which the hon. Gentleman refers. I have a great deal of practical statistical experience in knowing from where the savings of the people of this country come. The hon. Member is doing his friends an injustice if he does not recognise that on those abysmally low incomes—I do not seek to excuse them—there was always the opportunity of the penny a week being invested. That would produce very little. I accept that. People in those circumstances held on to their penny a week, saving it at a time when they could have been justified in directing it to other so-called luxuries. Those are facts from which he cannot get away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I really cannot allow interventions to go on at too great length.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman spoke about his statistical experience. I talk about practical experience. When he says that I do my own working class people—I do not apologise for the ex-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V003P0I0605">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
pression—a disservice by referring to these facts, I do not think I do. There are millions of people now in their 50s, 60s and 70s who do not have one penny saved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the Trade Union Congress Economic Review of 1971 where are pointed out the enormous discrepancies in wealth distribution in this country. This is basically the philosophy we are talking about this morning: the wealth distribution in this country. The Minister mentioned this—I thought, rather unjustly—at the end of his speech. I would remind him of the figures given in the T.U.C. review. We were debating last Friday pensions for Members, pensions for senior officials in the House, including the Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker. We were then not talking of 15p or £1 or £2. We were talking in thousands of pounds of non-contributory pensions for Prime Ministers and Lords Chancellor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about the increased contributions which would occur as a consequence of our Amendments. There is no such inevitable consequence. The richest 10 per cent. of our adult population in Britain today have 75 per cent. of the total wealth of the nation in their control. We can get at that. When the Minister says, "You must put up the contributions of the higher-paid workers", it is rubbish. It does not follow. If we mean to redistribute wealth, as we on this side are committed to do, we shall get it from that source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing is immutable about an 18 per cent. Exchequer contribution. There is no reason why the Exchequer contribution should not go up to 80 per cent. if need be. So long as one has a fair tax system, as long as one moves to an increasingly progressive tax system, and so long as one has a major party, and the alternative Government, committed to a redistribution of the national wealth, one can do all these things much more generously without increasing the contributions from the working man. He will contribute more through his taxation. The hon. Gentleman to that extent was right in saying that it is all coming out of the same pocket, but we shall get much more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>under our long-term proposals, by extracting it from that 10 per cent. who own 75 per cent. of the total wealth of the country, than ever the party opposite would dream.</p>
	<p>The Minister started by saying that some of our Amendments would mean that some people would get less. That is a favourite trick of Ministers. If they want arguments they nitpick. We lay draftsmen do not always see those particular nits. We therefore express a principle. We expect the Minister to answer on the principles. If he finds ho nits to pick, then he finds an anomaly. He knows as well as anybody else that the whole field of social security and the tax system is riddled with anomalies; but we go on seeking to eliminate them. As we eliminate one, we inevitably create another. The process is continuous, whatever party is in power. That suggestion does not wash at all.</p>
	<p>I have referred to the fact that our Amendments will cost more. The Minister says he has done his sums. The auction bid is £800 million a year on top of £500 million. Is it additional to that figure?</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is in addition to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister holds up his hands in horror at the mention of £800 million. Let him have a look at the last two Budgets. Here we are talking in a national context of the last two national Budgets the present Chancellor has introduced. If he looks at the amounts given in tax concessions to everybody earning over £4,000 or £5,000 a year he will see they will total much more than £800 million. If we want to redistribute the national wealth then the people we are talking about now are far more deserving than the people who have been given those enormous tax concessions under this Government. That is what these Amendments are about. That is what future Amendments on this Bill will be about. That is why we intend to divide on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
