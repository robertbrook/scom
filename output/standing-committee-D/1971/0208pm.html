	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My main effort during this morning's Sitting, when I was moving Amendment No. 736, in page 26, line 14, after "Commission", insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"in respect of the boundary between Greater London and the counties adjoining it within one year after the passing of this Act and in all other cases".</p></blockquote>
was to keep in order, as I recall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the field of my advocacy where I deal specifically with the terms of Clause 50, subsections (1) and (2) with which my two Amendments are concerned. I tried to deal earlier with the criteria which need to be taken into account when considering boundary reviews for local government purposes. I hope I was able to show that, as far as the G.L.C. is concerned, its interests—which clearly spread outside the existing boundaries—lead one to the inescapable conclusion that a boundary revision is required. There can be no question of the need for this. We are looking back at the London Government Act, 1963, which called for a review within 10 years, that is, by 1973.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not been able to discover where it is that the London Government Act required a review within 10 years. Can the hon. Member help me on this point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My information is that the Local Government Act required a review of the G.L.C. area in 1973. If I am not right—the Minister is shaking his head—perhaps the Minister will say in what way the London Government Act
	<span class='label label-info column'>1332</span>
dealt with the question of the review of the boundaries of the Greater London area. In this Bill we are clearly dealing with the Government's proposals that a review shall take place not less than 10 nor more than 15 years after 1st April, 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this Bill, a 10 year period is recognised as the time in which a review should take place. I can quite see that there are circumstances in which it might not be possible to make a review at about a 10 year period. The Government say that the review should not take place after a longer period than 15 years. The argument I am submitting is that a review of the boundaries of the Greater London area should be imminent, either in terms of the point that I made on the reform earlier, in 1963, or in the terms of the present Bill. The purpose of Amendment No. 736 is that there shall be a review within one year of the passing of the Act. I shall be interested to hear what my hon. Friends have to say on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that in Clause 50(2)
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by direction given to the English Commission vary the length of any interval specified in subsection (2) above either as respects the whole review or as respects any particular case or class of case."</p></blockquote>
So, as I understand it, the Secretary of State has the right to cause a review to be made. I hope that that is the correct interpretation of subsection (2) and I hope my hon. Friend will be able to direct his attention particularly to my interpretation, as to whether it is correct or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked at it essentially in terms of services and the necessity for review. I in no way judge the merits of any proposal that might be made. I do not want to get involved in the merits on either side, either from the G.L.C. side or from the outer metropolitan counties. I have not tried to look at the effects which it would have on those counties but I am conscious of the resistance there always is to boundary revisions. That is not my advocacy, which is directed to the date of a review. I hope it is recognised that a review is desirable and that in that context the Government will agree to see that we have a review as soon as possible following the passage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Morrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what my hon. Friend has said, both when I have been able to listen to him and in the course of the last two or three moments
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0726">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1333</span>
when unfortunately I missed his words of wisdom. I think there is a great deal to be said in favour of the Amendment. I think that not only were the recommendations of the orginal independent commission more correct in respect of London boundaries than the division which was made at the time of the London Government Act, but also I think that in the course of experience since the London Government Act the anomalies which now exist have come to light. I would not expect for a moment that as a result of objective reconsideration now or in the very near future, the Boundary Commission would keep to the original proposals made by the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless I have a suspicion that in the light of the original theoretical proposals and practical experience, in the light of developments which there have been around the boundaries of London, and in the light of the fact that there seems to be no real sense in the existing boundaries, a sensible Amendment could be made and the Boundaries Commission now would produce a picture which was not entirely different from that which was originally recommended. It seems to me. in the light of the provision which was in the London Government Act, which seems to be very much in accord with what my hon. Friend has proposed, that the Government should be prepared to give serious consideration to the Amendment. I cannot believe that it would be right either for people living in and around London or for the administration of local government in those areas that a review of the existing boundaries should be delayed for more than the minimum amount of time. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will give most careful consideration to the Amendment which my hon. Friend the Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones) has moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene merely to say that I find myself in total disagreement with hon. Gentlemen opposite. On a number of occasions this morning, Sir Stephen, you pointed out that the real point of the Amendment was to say
	<br><blockquote><p>"within one year after the passing of this Act".</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that if the Amendment were accepted, it would put the Government in an intolerable position, and I am
	<span class='label label-info column'>1334</span>
well-known for my tolerance and for my dislike of putting Governments in intolerable positions. The Government argued during Thursday morning's sitting that a mere change like the exclusion of aldermen in Greater London in time for the next election—1973 or whenever it is—would cause such profound dislocation that it really could not be done and a further date was needed, even though in principle hon. Gentlemen opposite might agree with it. So to argue now for a total change of boundaries within one year after the passing of this Measure seems to me senseless and puts the Government in an intolerable position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, as far as boundaries are concerned, we have well passed the First Schedule in which the boundaries of England were decided not, I admit, for all time because there might well be changes between now and Report—but certainly for a major discussion. Therefore, to introduce a new element at this stage seems to me again totally indefensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons and also for the reason that there would be considerable argument on the points of detail which the hon. Gentlemen have made, we on this side of the Committee would rigorously oppose such an Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Trew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This will be one of those rare occasions where I find myself in complete agreement with the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. Silkin). You have already made the point, Sir Stephen, that what is at issue in the Amendment is not whether there should at some time be a change in London's boundaries but whether that change should receive early consideration or be deferred for 10 to 15 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To accept the Amendment to review London's boundaries within a year could only cause confusion in the Home Counties, because any consideration now of groupings of existing local authorities to form the new district councils which have to take account of an early possible change in London's boundaries. There would obviously be flirtations and proposals of marriage across the London boundaries. This would not only affect the district councils on the periphery of London: it would have an effect throughout the Home Counties because, if a district were to merge with a London borough, thereby leaving a group of local authori-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0727">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1335</span>
ties on the outskirts of London, that would leave that group short of a district; it would make up that shortage by going into its own hinterland and so on, until there would be a chain reaction spreading out to the coasts of Kent and Sussex and, indeed, in all directions from London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could well be a case at some time in the future for changing London's boundaries or extending them. I personally do not favour the idea, though obviously it is something that will have to be considered. However, the time is not now. The Home Counties at this time are having to cope with a radical change in the structure of local government, and to impose this additional burden of uncertainty upon them would be intolerable and I hope that the Committee will reject the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Maddan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support those who are speaking against the sense of the Amendment. When I was a Member for one of the Hertfordshire seats, I was fairly intimately concerned with the problem of the inner Home Counties and their relationship with London. They have undergone substantial changes and, as my hon. Friend said, they will have to face substantial changes also under the Bill. It would be quite wrong and, if the Government were to accept the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones), they would be going back on assurances that they had given in the course of the last year. I hope, therefore, that the Government will stand firm on the Bill as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Northants. South (Mr. Arthur Jones) has argued in favour of requiring the Boundary Commission for England to review the outer boundary of Greater London. I must stress that the Amendment deals only with the outer boundary of Greater London and not with any amendment to the boundaries of the districts within London, the London boroughs. He requires that to occur within one year of the passing of the Act. That might, of course, be between this Easter and next Easter, or this Whitsun and next Whitsun, or this summer and next summer. At any rate, it would be at a time when the Boundary Com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1336</span>
mission was much employed with other work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not particularly wish to use that expediency argument, which was rather rammed down my throat when I used it on a previous Amendment. I should like to use the argument of principle here, and there are strong arguments against any quick review of the Greater London boundary, even after 1st April, 1974. The area of Greater London was exhaustively discussed in the debates on the London Government Act, 1963, and it really would be too soon to open all the arguments about whether Greater London should extend or include Esher, Epsom, or Banstead, or some other of the fringe areas to the Greater London boundary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Northants, South started his speech by speaking about the repercussions of what I will call the aldermanic Amendment. He argued that the Greater London Council, if deprived of aldermen—if we decided to do that—would have to look for councillors from somewhere else. Heaven forbid that they should extend the boundaries of Greater London just in order to help to collect a few more councillors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is reading a little more into my argument than is justified. My submission was that the membership of the Council would need looking at, not where the membership should come from.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend realises that I was teasing him a little, but he has argued this Amendment from the point of view of the idea that an extension of the Greater London boundaries is necessary and that this should be reviewed urgently. I am sure many of the Home Counties would say "Yes, let us have a review quickly, but we want to cut into the boundaries of the Greater London Council." This might well result from the review, and I do not think it is a review which should be undertaken at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to find that Deptford and Dartford agree. I have always been somewhat confused between the two names, and it is pleasant to find that they are agreeing on this. My hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Mr. Trew) made the point very well when he said this would just cause confusion in the Home Counties. It would indeed; it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0728">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1337</span>
bound to develop into a review not merely of the boundaries of the Greater London area, but right out into the South-East.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure the Committee that the Amendment is strongly opposed by the County Council's Association, by the Urban Districts Association, by various authorities, and certainly all those bordering on Greater London. One might expect opposition from them. But I think their argument that we should not undertake a review within one year of the passing of the Bill—that is, within a period before the operation of the boundaries already decided, as the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) said, in considering Clause 1 and Schedule 1 of the Bill—is a strong one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend deal with the point about interpretation on subsection (2)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what my hon. Friend wishes me to deal with. Subsection (2) deals with the power of the Secretary of State to give directions to the English Commission to vary the length of any interval specified in the subsection; that would be the interval of 10 to 15 years mentioned in subsection (1). Indeed, if occasion should arise when it seemed absolutely necessary to carry out a specific review of a boundary, not only in London but any other county or district throughout the whole of England, the Secretary of State could give directions accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one point which I failed to mention when I was on my feet before—the point which my hon. Friend made concerning an obligation to review the Greater London Boundary. He indicated his belief that under the London Government Act, 1963, there was some obligation to review the Greater London boundary within 10 years. There is no such time limit in the 1963 Act; a procedure for amending boundaries is provided in Section 6 of that Act, based on proposals being made to the Minister, and the Minister—who would now be the Secretary of State—making arrangements accordingly for local inquiries and for an order to be made eventually if he is satisfied that it would be right to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 6 will be repealed by the Bill, and for that reason we bring the Greater
	<span class='label label-info column'>1338</span>
London Council boundary within the Clause; there will be no review, except under very exceptional circumstances provided for in subsection (2), until the period of 10 to 15 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, particularly for dealing with the last two points. I understand his reluctance, and that of the Government, to face all the implications of a review of boundaries for the Greater London area. There have been representations that the Government is pushing the pace too fast in many areas of reform. A certain degree of timidity might be in evidence, that they were not prepared to go all the way and make a thorough job of it throughout the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was called tepid this morning. I am not going to risk being called timid as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend insists upon teasing me it is only fair that I should have an opportunity of doing the same to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee recognises the tremendous job that reform involves, and the added problems that would be associated with the proposals set out in the Amendment. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for dealing with the matter as he has, and to those who have contributed to the debate. I am grateful to you, Sir Stephen, for allowing me to present the case when I may have been a little out of order on one or two occasions. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg leave to move Amendment No. 719, in page 28, line 9, at end add:
	<br><blockquote><p>(9) Whenever a new town designation order has been made and this designation order establishes a new town in the area of more than one local authority, it shall be the duty of the English Commission to review the boundaries of these local authorities.</p></blockquote>
This Amendment arises out of experience in my own constituency, but I do not suggest that this experience is unique. The situation may arise in other parts of the country, both at present and in future, and the same situation could repeat itself in my constituency. On several previous occasions I have referred to the new town of Redditch, in my constituency. The designated area of that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0729">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1339</span>
new town includes not only the town of Redditch, in Worcestershire, but also part of Warwickshire, because Redditch is on the boundary between the two counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The designated area also includes a part of the rural district surrounding Redditch. It includes, therefore, parts of two counties and at least three district councils. Gradually the local government boundaries are being brought into line with the designated area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has happened in the past, and it will happen in the future, but there is a timing problem, and the purpose of the Amendment is to ensure that there would be an automatic review whenever a new town was designated. This would not mean that there would have to be Amendments, but at least the Boundary Commission would have to consider whether the local government boundaries should be redrawn in order to ensure that all the designated area of the new town was in the same district council and the same county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not so at present. It is not automatic, and it causes a great deal of inconvenience for everyone. It is inconvenient for the development corporation of the new town to have to deal with several local authorities when it needs to deal with only two—the county council and the district council. It is equally inconvenient for the people, particularly for the councils, in areas where several of them are affected by the proposals of the new towns corporation, and where a certain amount of liaison and consultation has to take place. It would be much easier if only one county council and one district council were involved in each new town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that local government boundaries should be drawn so that the district councils are identical with the designated areas. The local government boundaries may be much wider, as in Redditch. District councils will include parts which are not in the designated area. The important point is that all the designated area should be in one district council and in one county council. The Minister may assure me that this already happens, but the question is one of timing. It is important that it should happen at the beginning of a new town's life, before the master plan is published, so that when consultations take place about that master plan there is only one forum for debate
	<span class='label label-info column'>1340</span>
and only two bodies—the county and the district councils—putting forward opinions about the proposals of the development corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extremely important to have as few bodies as possible involved in discussing problems of this kind. It would help everybody if these changes took place as early as possible. It might not always be sensible to redraw local government boundaries, but the Amendment does not mean that local government boundaries would have to be redrawn. It means only that a review must take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment would require a review of local government boundaries when a new town is designated which straddles the boundaries. This should certainly be done, at least in respect of counties and districts, and possibly parishes. The hon. Gentleman has given the example of Redditch. One could think of Redditch swelling out into Birmingham, or taking Hadley Green and a bit of Solihull. We should obviously have to consider a review of the boundaries there. I have indicated the most likely event which is not so much the designation of a new town but the designation of an extended area of the town. It would be reasonable to extend the principle contained in the hon. Gentleman's Amendment to cover extensions of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think—and I stress the word "think"—that it is necessary to make specific provision in the Bill. However, there may be some marginal advantage in spelling it out in the Bill and ensuring that there should be review on these occasions. I readily accept the principle of the Amendment. I ask the hon. Member for Bromsgrove to let me consider whether a useful purpose would be served by an Amendment of this sort. If I consider that it is right I shall introduce it—or ask the hon. Member to introduce it—on Report, in order to cover both the basic point of his Amendment—of designating a new town—and the additional point concerning extensions of existing designated areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the point, and I would like to see whether an Amendment is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an Amendment to deal with a Minister who is being neither tepid nor timid, but too assertive to suit our views. It deletes the word "direct" from the opening line of the Clause and inserts the word "request".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a point of substance here. Any Minister, when dealing with boundary review, has great difficulty because he is acting in two capacities. Obviously, he is acting in his Ministerial capacity—a political capacity. In a sense, he is also acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, because he is concerning himself basically with electoral arrangements on behalf of the nation as a whole and not specifically on behalf of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to us that there are dangers in the Secretary of State's being able to give directions to the Boundary Commission to carry out reviews of principal areas. If the Boundary Commission acts as we all hope that it will act, with complete independence and a sense of continuous approach to the problems with which it is confronted, I am sure that when it needs to review the boundaries of principal areas, this will be done. There will be some occasions—for which we ought to provide—when what we all hope for does not happen. It will then be the duty of the Secretary of State to draw the attention of the Boundary Commission to a situation that has occurred in a given area, to ask it to look at the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to be within the philosophy that I have tried to propound that in such circumstances the Secretary of State should request rather than direct the Commission to review the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned not merely with local government boundaries which adds additional point to the importance of the Amendments. The parliamentary boundary commissioners have to review parliamentary boundaries at intervals of 10 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Richard Sharples)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ten to 15 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 10 to 15 years—not less than 10 years. The parliamentary boundary commissioners must have regard to local government boundaries. It could be argued that if the Secretary of State—whoever he might be—gave an unreasonable direction to the Boundary Commission in this respect the effect of his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0731">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1343</span>
unreasonable direction would be to determine not only the local government boundaries but the parliamentary situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that on a previous occasion in the last Parliament Members of the then Opposition—now the present Government—regarded it as an important matter of principle that there should be no interference with the findings of the Boundary Commission. When they came into office one of the first things they did was automatically to legislate for the enforcement of the Commission's proposals. If this is hallowed ground—if the Commission is to be independent, and is to be seen to be independent—it would seem logical to extend that sort of thinking into the sort of wording in the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission ought not to be directed to carry out a review: it should be requested to do so if it so wishes, leaving it free to carry out the review or to judge that there is a good and substantial reason why it ought not to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 465, which deals specifically with subsection (1), is being taken with this Amendment. I support what my hon. Friend has said about the words "direct" and "request". The word "direct" clearly implies that the English Boundary Commission is a subservient arm of Government and the Ministry. The word "request" means that it is an independent body, and that the Minister can only ask it to do something, must take note of its findings, and cannot order it to do something. That is very significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for the Environment has acted in the most high-handed way with the Committee and with the House in the way that he set up the Commission prior to getting the approval of the Committee or the House. He set it in force; he is paying the members he is giving them office space, and they are reviewing boundaries in local authorities throughout the country at the moment. We are receiving papers relating to matters discussed by the Commission with the local authorities concerned, and we still have to consider the Report stage on the boundaries of those very authorities, which can upset the whole position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the way that the Minister, in a very cavalier fashion, has dealt with the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1344</span>
Commission—without reference to the House. I agree entirely with what my hon. Friend says. The word "direct" means that the independent status of that Commission is to some extent taken away, so that it becomes an arm of the Department rather than an independent body advising the Department. The matter is made even worse when one reads subsection (5), the Clause, which provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may direct the English Commission not to undertake during a specified period a review of any one or more local government areas or parts of such areas."</p></blockquote>
That comes from a Government who, when in Opposition, made such a play of the fact that the previous Government, from very proper motives, delayed the implementation of the Boundary Commission's proposals until local government boundaries were settled. This same Government now want to give power to the Secretary of State to direct the Commission not to look at a particular area. It may be argued that the Secretary of State would never use this power; or would use it only on limited occasions, when there were major redevelopments or great changes of planning in the area. For example, when a new town was envisaged, the Secretary of State might say, "You shall not look at this area because of the changes that are implicit in the area. It would be better if you looked at it later."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Clause speaks of a specified period it does not limit that period; the Secretary of State could make it a period of 50 years. In such a situation, if I am anticipating the Minister of State's reply correctly, why does not the Commission itself come back to the Minister and say that because of the major development planned in the area it would prefer not to look at the area for a given number of years. This should be for the Commission to say. It should not be for the Minister to direct it not to look at a given area, which could be open to abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point of my Amendment coincides absolutely with what my hon. Friend was saying about the status of the Commission. Both the Committee and the House should ensure that it has an independent status; that it is not an arm of Government to be directed by any Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0732">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1345</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may detail what the Amendments would do, because it is important to divide them between the two categories of the Commission's function in deciding boundaries and its function in deciding electoral arrangements. As I understand it, Amendments Nos. 491 and 496 cover directions to the Commission to review the principal areas in England and Wales. Amendment No. 492 covers directions not to review a particular area and Amendment No. 465, in the name of the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) would delete this power altogether, without even replacing it by advice instead of direction. Amendments Nos. 494 and 498 cover directions to the Commissioners to review electoral arrangements, and Amendments Nos. 495 and 499 cover directions to the Commissioners on the order in which they do their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for inserting the word "direct" is that the Secretary of State may wish to direct on any of these matters, which I have listed in describing the Amendments, if some other action that is proceeding would make it convenient for the review either to be expedited, or to be delayed until that other action has taken place. I have in mind particularly town and country planning matters which might well make it desirable for a review to be accelerated so that, for example, a regional strategy or a structure plan could take that into account, or delayed to await some planning action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the kind of matter on which the Secretary of State would wish to express himself by direction rather than advice. He can always be accountable to Parliament for any directions that he gives. By using the word "direct", one pins the responsibility upon the Secretary of State, and thereby making him answerable in Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure what the position of Parliament would be if the Commission were left entirely to its own devices. Parliament would not be in a position to ask the Secretary of State why he did not give the directions, since he had the power to do so. He could reply that he had no power to give directions, since the body was entirely independent. We should therefore consider the fact that it makes a Minister responsible and answerable to the House.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be valuable to phase the review of Parliamentary boundaries with the review of local government boundaries. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) raised this point on a previous occasion, when he said that there might be conflict between the deliberations of the Parliamentary Boundary Commission and the Local Government Boundary Commission. There would probably not be any difficulty initially, but there might be difficulty in the 10- to 15-year period, or after that, in phasing the reviews together. It might be useful, at that stage, if the Secretary of State had power to give directions to the Boundary Commission about its reviews.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to stress the question of reviews of boundaries. I must hold firm to the wording of the Bill in that respect and give the Secretary of State the power to direct in those cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument of the hon. Member for Small Heath applies particularly to electoral arrangements. It may well be that we could provide for the sort of difficulties which he has in mind in connection with electoral arrangements. My hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office, would like an opportunity to reconsider the question and see whether we can meet the argument put forward. There is some validity in saying that we should not direct the Commission on electoral matters, but I should like to retain the power and be answerable to Parliament for phasing the Commission's work so that local government boundaries fit in with reviews of the parliamentary boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged, to the Minister for the kind way in which he has given us his views on this matter. If I thought that he was right in his view that the deletion of "direct" and the substitution of "request" removes the matter from the orbit of parliamentary questioning I should be as alarmed as he is. I appreciate his reasoning, though I do not believe that it is so; I think that it would still be open for hon. Members to ask the Secretary of State why he had not requested the Commission to do something, just as they could ask him why he had not so directed it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was right in saying that my main concern is the integrity of elec-

	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>b</i>) a district council not to undertake during a specified period a review of the whole or any specified part of their district, which they have power to review under that section".</p></blockquote>
In this Amendment we return to a discussion that we had this morning on the question of the district councils' reviews. The Amendment completes the procedure by giving the Secretary of State power to direct a district council not to carry out a review of parishes in its area under Clause 50(7).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has power under Clause 51(5) to direct the Commission not to conduct a review. That will bring in direction in respect of parishes. A proposal may be imminent which would make the review irrelevant or even abortive. The review might have been referred to the Commission above the heads of the district council, as we discussed this morning.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That Clause 51, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister pointed out that I had removed subsection (5) without putting anything in its place. That is true, because if the Boundary Commission meets problems of major planning areas, and so on, it has the power to make recommendations contained in subsection (1). I therefore contend that subsection (5) would be unnecessary if
	<span class='label label-info column'>1348</span>
the onus not to look at an area were not a matter of the Secretary of State's direction but a matter for the Commission itself. It would mean that a body of reasonable men, looking at an area in which major developments were to take place, were telling the Minister that they proposed not to make any recommendations under that review because of what they had found in respect of future planning in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has kindly consented to consider my hon. Friend's Amendments on the question of "request" and "direct". Will he also consider whether it is necessary to put this negative direction in the Clause, rather than leaving the question to the Commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Boundary Commission is required to carry out a review, and there is a drill for so doing. I stress that the Secretary of State would not in any way be directing the Commission to make a recommendation; he would be requesting it to carry out a review. He would not be dictating to the Commission what it should recommend at the end of the review. To that extent the Commission would be an independent body. For the sake of completeness, we need subsection (5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brynmor John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not fully answered the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes). He pointed out that the Secretary of State, whilst not dictating what the Commission should report, is, by virtue of subsection (5), proscribing the time in which they may not carry out a review. That is surely as important as the content of the eventual report, since, under subsection (1) the duty is laid on them to undertake reviews at intervals of not less than 10 nor more than 15 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as I read it, the Secretary of State could direct the English Commission not to undertake the review for a period which would take it outside the period laid down in Section 50 (1). Surely, the Minister realises that it would be reasonable—even if he feels that he must include the subsection in the Bill—to put in the saving Clause that nothing in his direction shall prevent the English Commission from carrying out their duty under Section 50 (1)—in other words, that he shall not proscribe them from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0734">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1349</span>
undertaking a review for 50 years, for example—which was the example of my hon. Friend. This is a far-fetched example, but it is theoretically possible under the subsection. I ask him to look at this, and perhaps re-consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1350</span>
per thousand additional voters as it may think fit.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a probing Amendment to deal with parish councils. It really takes into account the electoral divisions. The Amendment is moved, not in a state of having a complete Amendment, but to emphasise the need for having a flexible and informal method of dividing parishes, and of increasing representation wherever population movements render that necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is accepted by all of us that parishes owe their success as parish councils to the connection they have with people in a particular locality. People in a locality who are faced with voting for an undivided parish—if there is a parish of. say, a dozen, which happens to be the case in the parish in which I live—often have a list of 24 or 25 names, from which they must choose 12. Clearly, this is of advantage to those whose names are high up in the alphabet. It proves nothing except the stamina of the voter. It certainly has little to do with the sense of representation which they want. This is why I believe that in a large parish—and some of them can be extremely large—with a large population, the unit of the parish council should be stripped down into a smaller unit with which people are identified readily, and for whom they can choose the best representative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I am moving the Amendment that in any parish which has a population of more than 2,000 people, the parish shall be divided into parish wards. It seems to me that it was accepted by the Minister, and on all sides, that the district council might well be slow to take advantage of any proposal by the parish council, or in the implementation by the parish council for warding of the parish. If we are to have a properly responsive democratic organisation in the parish council, we should have this ready response, this informal and flexible arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that what I have suggested, since it is mandatory, is not flexible but is an attempt to probe the Minister's thinking, and perhaps it will evoke a response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second Amendment, Amendment No. 779, would insert at the end of the Clause, the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"() Where the population of the parish has. since 1st April 1975, increased its population by two thousand electors or more, the council
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0735">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1351</span>
shall review the numbers of parish councillors and fix such additional numbers of councillors for the said parish council not exceeding one per thousand additional voters as it may think fit."</p></blockquote>
This again is borne out by experience. Many areas with a fairly small population, which were formerly rural and covered by a parish council, have suddenly seen, because of housing developments, a rapid growth in the size of the parish. The number of parish councillors which was adequate for an electorate of 3,000 would not be adequate for a population of 10,000 or 12,000. In my own parish the electorate has trebled within the last 10 years. A proposal is needed whereby the number of councillors should be increased as the size of the parish increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there may have to be a mechanism whereby any disastrous fall in population would also have to be compensated, but I do not believe that it should be left to the district council, who may be inert or unwilling to effect these changes in representation. We should consider how best to ensure that the parish council is the most appropriate form of local government for the area. Parish councils have few formal powers; if they are to succeed they must fulfil a need in the community. To do that they must be the most appropriate size for that community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not dispute the objective of the hon. Gentleman's proposal. He talked, very rightly, about the need for flexibility and that is why I would not be able to accept his suggestion of an increase of 2,000 in the population as a numerical criterion for forcing a review. In a small parish of, say, 500 people, an increase of 300 is much more important than in a small town forming a parish with a population of 10,000 or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right to have the flexibility; that flexibility is contained in the Clause as drafted. Subsection (6) provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the council of each district in England to keep under review the electoral arrangements …"</p></blockquote>
and there is a fall-back position in subsection (7) and those which follow, whereby if the district councils fail to carry out their duty, the English Commission can carry out their duty for them. In the event of a dispute, the matter
	<span class='label label-info column'>1352</span>
is eventually referred to the Secretary of State. I think the hon. Gentleman's point is met and it is met in a way which provides flexibility rather than by laying down definite numbers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply. I had, of course, considered subsection (7) when drafting the Amendment and I am not entirely happy that it meets the point.

The existing provision for review of the electoral arrangements in London is under Part 3 of Schedule 1 of the London Government Act, 1963, which contains provisions for altering the electoral arrangements.

The position is that when the Bill becomes law it comes into force on 1st April, 1974 and there could be a period between the time when the Bill has passed this House and when it comes into force, on 1st April, 1974, when one could have two systems working in parallel. The purpose of this Amendment is to make certain that from the time of passing of the Bill by Parliament no further representations are made under the existing procedure—that is, Schedule 3 of the London Government Act 1963.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed.</i> That Clause 52, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is really a matter of clarification. In Clause 52(4) I should like some clarification of what the Government mean by the words "or otherwise". The subsection reads:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0736">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1353</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Without prejudice to subsection (2) above, the English Commission may at any time, whether at the request of a local authority or otherwise, review the electoral arrangements for a principal area in England …"</p></blockquote>
Does "or otherwise" mean whether a request is made or not? Or does "or otherwise" mean whether a request is made other than by the local authority? I hope it means the second, as I suspect it possibly does, because that would mean that for example, a political party seeing that the electoral arrangements in a particular area had become antiquated, could go along to the local government Commission at any time and point this out to them, so that a review would take place. I can see dangers, however, if it gets to a smaller group than a political party—for example if it got to an individual elector. Under subsection (7), when we are dealing with the parish council, specific provision is made that the local authority or not less than 30 local government electors of the parish can ask for a review of local arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If "or otherwise" means what I suspect it means, it presumably means that one individual person presumably could go along to the Commission and ask for a review. It may not mean that at all. I might be way out in what I am thinking, but I should like to hear the Minister of State's explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is another problem which I should like to bring to the attention of the Committee in this Clause. This is the possibility of conflict between the provisions in subsection (2) of the Clause concerning the periodic reviews to be conducted by the English Commission into the electoral arrangements for principal areas, and the provisions for the initial reviews which are laid down later in Schedule 9 of the Bill. That Schedule says that the initial review for electoral arrangements for principal areas should take place
	<br><blockquote><p>"As soon as practicable after the first election of councillors …"</p></blockquote>
But it is conceivable that such reviews would not be completed, or even begun, before 1st April, 1974. I understand that in the timetable which is being suggested for the drawing up of the initial review for the electoral arrangements for counties, it may well not get under way before 1st April, 1974. I wonder, therefore,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1354</span>
whether the wording of subsection (2) of the Clause might preclude that initial review from taking place. I grant that this is a situation which none of us wants but I wonder whether we are writing this contradiction into the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may deal with the first point raised by the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), the answer is "Yes"; he has hit the nail on the head. The intention is that representations could be made by a political party. As far as a single election is concerned, it would be possible for a single elector to make representations, but certainly the Boundary Commission need not take notice of that. It would be in order, however, for a political party to make representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point made by the' hon. Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall) was contained in an Amendment of his which was not selected. There is some force in the argument which he has put forward and, although the hon. Member's Amendment was not selected, I should like to consider between now and Report the substance of what was contained in that Amendment. I am grateful to him for raising the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The objective of both Amendments is quite simple. I suppose it could be argued that the spirit of the Bill as drafted would cover these Amendments, but it is important to write them into the Bill to provide more assurance to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0737">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1355</span>
local authorities and to make the Bill more precise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of Amendment No. 442, it is thought that there should be a distinct obligation on the Commission to ensure that the authorities concerned in any change know at an early stage what fate is proposed for them. It is not enough to say, as seems to be implied in the Bill, that the authorities in question will probably know in any event. Changes in district structures involve the rearrangement or abolition of parishes, which might be less well acquainted with the course of the argument. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to accept the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Amendment No. 443, it is felt that the Secretary of State should give a limited opportunity for the hearing of representations before issuing an order. If he had to give this limited opportunity, almost certainly fewer Prayers could be brought before the House later. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend will be able to accept these two fairly small but nevertheless quite important Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) wants the English Commission to report to the local authorities as well as to the Secretary of State. There is provision in the Clause for a report to the Secretary of State, and I think my hon. Friend will find that his Amendment is not necessary. By Clause 62 (5) (b), the Commission is required to deposit a copy of the report with the local authority. In that way the local authority will become aware of the report and I do not think that provision for reporting to local authorities is necessary in view of the procedure under Clause 62.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In pursuance of the principle that local authorities should come well into the picture at this stage, Amendment No. 443 has been added to give a statutory breathing-space of not less than six weeks between the submission of a report by the English Commission and the making of an order by the Secretary of State. There is no formal right of appeal to the Secretary of State, and I do not think that is needed, but I am grateful to my hon. Friend for suggesting that it would be worthwhile to have a minimum breathing-space of this sort within which, in prac-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1356</span>
tice, aggrieved authorities or persons might make representations to the Secretary of State. I wish not to provide a right of appeal to the Secretary of State but to give at least a period during which representations may be made and discussions and consultations may take place, so that local authorities are brought well into the picture at that stage.

I should like to say that although I could accept my hon. Friend's Amendment, its exact wording is not entirely acceptable. I do not know, Sir Stephen, whether you would be prepared to accept a form of manuscript Amendment if my hon. Friend chose to put it forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we can consider that, perhaps the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) will first withdraw his Amendment No. 442.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the assistance of the Committee I have had a manuscript Amendment submitted which puts in more appropriate words, as the Minister indicated, the sense of the Amendment for the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>Manuscript Amendment made:</i> in page 31, line 3 at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>Provided that an order giving effect to any such proposals shall not be made until after the expiry of six weeks from the day on which those proposals were submitted to him.—[	<i>Mr. Charles Morrison.</i>]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 639, in page 31, line 16, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>(5) A statutory instrument containing an order under this section which—
	<ol>
	<li>alters the area of a majority of the parishes in any particular district, and</li>
	<li>to which a majority of the parish councils or parish meetings of the parishes proposed to be altered have objected, shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
It is appreciated and conceded that Parliament should not be troubled with parish boundary orders which concern only a few houses or orders which are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0738">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1357</span>
not controversial. Where, however, it is intended to revolutionise the whole parish lay-out of entire districts, possibly against the will of those concerned, the people affected should not be denied access to Parliament. The new districts may have up to 60 parishes each, and wholesale changes on this scale are not trivial. Therefore, I feel that the provision contained within the Amendment should be built into the Bill. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will again be prepared either to accept the Amendment or. to provide me with a reasonable explanation why this provision is not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not tell my hon. Friend that it is not necessary. I think it is a very good Amendment in principle. The effect would be to make Orders affecting the boundaries of parishes subject to the negative Resolution procedure when they alter a majority of the parishes of a district and are opposed by a majority of the parishes concerned. The Bill makes no provision for any parliamentary procedure for orders affecting parishes, and no such provision applied in the 1933 Act. It would not be reasonable, I think, to burden Parliament with the generality of parish orders, even opposed orders. But an order producing widespread local controversy is a quite different matter It may warrant an extension of parliamentary procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here, I come into my own once again in my capacity as ex-Chairman of the Statutory Instruments Committee and I think it worthwhile in this case, where there is controversy between a number of parishes, an order that should come before Parliament if any right hon. or hon. Member wishes to raise it on the negative procedure. I should like to try to work out the procedure. There are procedural difficulties in the way my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) has drafted his Amendment and, therefore, I ask him to give me a chance to think out the appropriate procedure whereby we could bring these important controversial parish orders before the House if any right hon. or hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point of Amendment No. 500 is basically this. Under Clauses 50, 51 and 52 there is a duty and power to review local government areas and electoral arrangements in England. Under Clause 54(1) the Secretary of State may, if he wishes, give the Commission or a district council directions for guidance in conducting reviews under those Clauses. Under subsection (2) however, he can do that only after they have had consultation with associations
	<br><blockquote><p>"appearing to the Secretary of State to be representative of local authorities".</p></blockquote>
We are back again at the point which has been raised many times in this Committee and has been many times sympathetically grunted at by the Minister of State, Home Office,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister for Local Government and Development will be as sympathetic as his hon. Friend has been on other occasions, because the purpose
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0739">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1359</span>
of writing in "and other interested bodies" is to insert the right of political parties and of any other organisations in the area which may have advice which they wish to give and which the Secretary of State believes that the council or Commission should consider. That is the sole purpose of the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) seems to have read subsection (2) incorrectly. If I caught the gist of his argument, it was that a direction could not be given until the English Commission had consulted associations appearing to the Secretary of State to be representative of local authorities. The subsection provided that the Secretary of State should not give those directions until he had so consulted. I do not know that it makes a great difference, but there is a difference of principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no direction here that the Commission shall consult anybody. It will be free to consult whomsoever it wishes. The only restriction is that the Secretary of State shall not give directions about reviews under this Clause until he has consulted the local authority associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Amendment he would also have to consult all other people—"other interested bodies"—I fear that that would take us into the wide field of professional bodies, trade associations, amenity bodies and trade unions. Everybody seems to be concerned in local government reviews, one way or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I ask the right hon. Member for Deptford to reconsider the principle of his Amendment, in that we intend to leave the Commission free to consult whomever it chooses, but if the Secretary of State is to give it a direction about reviews he must first consult the local authority associations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had another look at the wording. I find it just as capable of my interpretation as it is of the Minister's. That is the difficulty. Basically, I should be happy with consultation that took place, wherever necessary, with political organisations as well as local authority associations. I do not mind how it is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall withdraw these Amendments—or beg leave to withdraw them; I might be prevented—provided that the Minister, for his part, is aware that there should be wider consultation. I appreciate that trade associations, and so on, may be
	<span class='label label-info column'>1360</span>
involved—so this becomes a matter of wording, but if the Minister can achieve the substance of what I want, or at least consider it, I shall be satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I shall consider whether we should introduce any provision for consultation with the political parties. It would be wrong to direct the Secretary of State to consult the political parties, but we must leave the Commission free to do so. I should like to consider whether we should put in a direction that it should do so. At the moment I would rather leave it free to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that meets the point very clearly. I am most grateful. In the light of my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are drafting Amendments, which are particular to the Welsh provisions. Clause 57(4) and Clause 58(5) have no counterpart in the companion English Clauses 50 and 51. In Clause 57 the insertion of "such" in line 29 is simply to improve the drafting. The other three Amendments to Clause 57 hang together. The reason is that the wording of the Bill is too compressed at this point and needs to be expanded for the sake of clarity and consistency. The present wording refers to proposals or recommendations of the Welsh Commission or of district councils. Only the Commission makes proposals for changes. The district councils recommend the making of proposals. The Amendments
	<span class='label label-info column'>1362</span>
clarify the wording by inserting full references for the Commission's proposals and the district councils' recommendations for such proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Clause 58, the first two Amendments, to lines 42 and 44, are exactly parallel to the Amendments to Clause 57, lines 23, 25 and 46. The third Amendment, to line 45, is needed to correct the reference in the last three lines of the Clause. This says that the procedure specified in subsections (1) to (4) of Clause 58 should apply to proposals or recommendations by the Welsh Commission or district councils on the matters covered by Clause 57(4)—the establishment or dissolution of community councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedure in subsections (1) to (4) of Clause 58 starts with a direction by the Secretary of State. The latter part of subsection (5) deals with the situation where, the direction having been given, the Commission or the district council is in the same position as it would be if Clause 57(4) applied, namely, it has decided what recommendations or proposals to make about areas, and must now consider recommendations or proposals about community councils. It is therefore appropriate to apply the procedural provisions in Clause 57(1) to subsection (3), which apply also to action under subsection (4).

The point which I made to the Minister of State on the English part of the Bill this morning, on the decrease in the number of negative Resolution procedures which have actually come before the House in sufficient time or at all, is valid here. If this were to be the method of proceeding on Welsh boundaries, there would be considerable unease in the Principality.

Local authority" includes parish councils; "principal council" does not include parish councils. The effect of these Amendments is to provide that copies of reports and recommendations on area reviews, and draft orders on electoral reviews, are to be put on deposit for public inspection at the offices of county and district councils only for the practical reason that all parish councils do not have offices at which these could be adequately exhibited. It is best to rely on the deposited copies being available at the district or county offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rest of the provisions here are to ensure that the district council makes the public aware of these documents. There is more certainty that it will be done if they are deposited at the district office than through a parish council. The Amendments make no change in the provisions for publicity generally for draft proposals and other documents. I hope that this will be acceptable. It looks on the face of it as if we are depriving the parish council of something, but it will make certain that by a proper procedure in the district council we throw the responsibility on to the district council to make these draft orders known to the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the Minister's explanation. Whilst I agree on practical grounds that what he is proposing is good sense, nevertheless some arrangement ought to be made to exhibit such proposals widely and for the convenience of the public. Nothing engenders more public interest than proposals to change boundaries, even in respect of parish council and district boundaries. One would have thought that the local library service or the post office could be used for this purpose. In some cases we are talking of quite considerable distances and of rural areas with inadequate public transport for people to get to the district council office to look at the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to think about this matter between now and Report to see whether an obligation could be placed on the principal councils to exhibit such proposals as widely as possible so that people can consult official documents without the tremendous inconvenience of having to travel a distance to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This imposes a general obligation, and it is an obligation which applies to all the subsections of the Clause. On previous occasions the House has sought to place an obligation on local authorities to make public what they are doing and what is happening and we have been able to do it by guidance and circular. I think this is the best way to proceed in this case rather than try to define exactly how the publicity should be given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It then sets out the form of publicity which will be given to that report. The Bill as printed is in error because it left out the case of the report by the district council. This is an essential although quite minor Amendment which is designed to place district councils under the same obligations as the Boundary Commissions in respect of informing local authorities and other interested bodies what views they have reached as a result of the review undertaken by such a council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Amendment is essential because Clause 62(5)(	<i>b</i>) at present makes no provision for the situation where the Commission reports to the Secretary of State that it has no proposals for any changes. There is provision for publicity and report to the Secretary of State by the Commission when it makes a report, but it has power to say that it is not making a report and we want this to be reported to the Secretary of State.

	<div class='title'>LOCAL INQUIRIES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 502, in page 39, line 17, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>Provided that where the Commission receives an objection from an interested principal authority or from a body of electors numbering one hundred or more, a local inquiry shall be held.</p></blockquote>
Clause 63 empowers a Commission or a district council to cause a local inquiry to be held in respect of any review which it carries out under this Part of the Bill. We are seeking to give other people the right to have an inquiry if they so wish. We particularly place great emphasis upon a body of electors who may take exception to a proposal having the right to have the proposal and the evidence tested at a public inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, no such rights exist in Clause 63 either to a principal authority or to a body of electors. I do not think it can be argued that 100 electors is too small a number. It might be argued that it is too large, but for my purposes it is a reasonable number. If 100 electors feel so aggrieved, it is reasonable that they should have the right to demand the holding of a local inquiry so that evidence can be tested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an extremely important point because it goes to the root of our concept of the Boundary Commission. The Bill enables both the English and the Welsh Commissions to hold public inquiries if they think fit. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>1370</span>
Amendment seeks to add a duty to hold an inquiry if there is a demand by a certain number of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our whole approach to the Bill as regards the Boundary Commission is that the procedure will be open and fair but, at the same time, simple, economical and relatively speedy. I contemplate that the Commission will, for the most part, conduct its business by consultation, particularly, first, with the local authorities and then with other interested bodies by way of conference around a table rather than by a formal public inquiry, which I call the litigation type of inquiry that we have known before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must admit that in another capacity I have appeared at many of these Boundary Commission inquiries and sat at them day after day, night after night, and have found them to be, in my own view, entirely the wrong way to come to a decision on matters of this sort. That is why, in drafting the Bill, I have been eager to provide the simplest possible formula for assisting the Commission to arrive at its decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite that, there are bound to be occasions when there is such public controversy and general public interest that a round-table conference will not be sufficient. There may also be occasions when a recalcitrant or perverse witness who has some really important evidence to put before the public as well as the Commission needs to be subpoenaed at a formal inquiry. There is power for the Commission to hold a public inquiry but it is a power which we would wish to leave to the good sense of the Commission to decide when an inquiry was appropriate and when it was not, and this is the basis on which we have drafted these provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, between the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell), if he believes in his Amendment, and myself there is a fundamental breach on what we want to see from the Commission. I want to see informal consultations. I do not want to provide my former profession and that of the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) with a lot of work, an array of counsel and formal inquiries. That it will be necessary on certain occasions, but let us try to give the Commission power to come to its conclusions by round-table consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is quite
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0745">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1371</span>
right, of course. There has been far too much agreement today between the two sides of the Committee. When the hon. Gentleman says that there is a fundamental breach, indeed once more into it we go, with gusto. It is alarming that the democratic rights of 100 people should be so discounted by the Minister in this offhand manner. More seriously, we are disappointed by his reply. After all, Clause 63 is about the holding of local inquiries, not about the formal or informal manner in which inquiries shall be conducted. I agree with the Minister's main point that where it is possible to hold such inquiries on an informal basis, when the average citizen who cannot afford to engage counsel or a solicitor wishes to give evidence, the greater the informality the better. A man can come to a quiet committee and express his opinion or grievance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing here with circumstances in which the Commission or the district council wishes to cause a local inquiry to be held. Presumably it will want to do that if either of two eventualities arises: first, if the proposals are of a major character which should be subjected to proper examination with legal representatives; and secondly, if anything is proposed which seems to be a matter of considerable controversy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, other circumstances could arise in which it would not seem wrong for 100 electors to obtain such a local inquiry if they wished. I should have thought that 100 electors signifying such an intention would suggest that there was a large measure of doubt or active disagreement about the proposals. It would seem a good democratic point that if 100 electors got together to object, they would be entitled to have their objections heard by a local inquiry. I do not want the Minister to concede the point now, but before withdrawing the Amendment I hope he will undertake to look again at the point in the hope that we may return to it on Report. If he is unable to do that, I shall withdraw the Amendment with the hope of protecting it so that I may return to it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I shall look at it again. In trying to explain what was in my mind I left an indefinite line between the consultations cases and those in which I
	<span class='label label-info column'>1372</span>
would expect the Commission to order an inquiry. But I will not decide, or force the Commission to decide, on the number of people who object. Having dealt with the Bill over a period of time, I can assure right hon. and hon. Members that there is no difficulty in getting 100 people to object to everything in the Bill. The referenda which I have received assure me of that. However good or popular it may be with tens of thousands of people, there are always at least 100 people to object to any provision of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Teesside at the moment it would be a job to find 100 who were in favour of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new paragraph (	<i>c</i>), as it appears in Amendment No. 685, is designed to achieve those arrangements.

This is a drafting Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister has a little more explanation than that. We were given a detailed assurance when we were dealing with Part IV of Schedule 1, on the subject of piers and other curious things which stuck out into the sea. The Minister moved a paving Amendment at that stage in order to bring forward rather clearer proposals when we came to the points dealing with piers and so on. I wonder whether these matters, which we would hold at that time introduced problems of medieval law as to where boundaries were set up, can now be explained to us, or whether we are adding to the complications by introducing piers into the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment does not deal with boundaries in any way. It deals with financial provisions for the capital moneys to be raised, and applied by local authorities under the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drafting is necessary in order to bring the wording of Clause 70(7)(	<i>a</i>) into line with the wording of Section 11 of the Local Government Financial Provisions Act, 1963, which I am quite sure the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) knows by heart. He will know that "pier" comes in there, just after the word "dock" and before the words" or ferry". We are merely making it comply with that Section.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"shall in the case of orders under this Part of this Act, apply only in relation to any supplementary provision contained in any such order, and an order varying or revoking any such provision shall only be made ".</p></blockquote>
Again, this is a drafting Amendment, but perhaps I ought to explain it a little further. It is designed to simplify and to clarify Clause 71(1). Those hon. Members and right hon. Members who have done much better than I have by reading to the end of the Bill will recognise that in Clause 245(2) there is a simple procedure for Ministers to vary or revoke orders under the Bill. That is quite a usual provision, and one which is a quite proper exercise of a Governmental function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want Ministers, either existing ones or future ones, messing about with Orders which are made by virtue of certain parts of the Bill. The orders dealing with substantive matters under Part IV, such of the alteration of the area of a county, are such that it would not be right for them to be capable of annulment or variation, without going through the whole procedure of Part IV again. Thus, the powers of Clause 245 should not extend to Orders made under Part IV. This is the part of the Bill which we are debating now, and to which the Amendments refer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are some supplementary and consequential matters with which Part IV deals, which are not of such importance. There is no reason why Clause 245, and the procedure under the Clause, should not extend to them. That is what Clause 71(1) is intended to convey. It conveys it more easily and clearly if it uses the words "supplementary provision" to describe the matters to which Clause 245 should apply. "Supplementary provision" is defined in Clause 71(6).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The other Amendments are consequential.

The Bill, as introduced, refers only to the Secretary of State in connection with the preparation and making of these Orders. The purpose of the Amendments is to put the district councils in the same position in relation to their Orders as is the Secretary of State in relation to his Orders, for the purposes of the procedure under Clause 71.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is mainly a technical machinery Clause.

It applies to every accretion from the sea, whether it is natural or artificial. It applies to any part of the sea shore to low water mark, which does not immediately before 1st April, 1974, form part of a parish.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that if they became permanent structures they would be rateable. Whether they will come within the area of the local authority is covered by the undertaking which I have given to look at this. If they are near the shore and are part and parcel of the land, I imagine that they will become part of that local authority's area. It is difficult to say whether a structure is permanent. I recollect on one occasion advising about some chalets along the Dorset coast which it was sought to declare rateable. I advised my client to put wheels on them, and we got away with it.

As an interested party, since this greatly affects my constituency, I should much like to know whether the Minister accepts that boundary.

	<br><blockquote><p>"in the parish and elsewhere".</p></blockquote>
You, Sir Stephen, will have had cause to notice the incredible activity of Wiltshire Members of Parliament in the House and on the Committee stage of the Bill. However, I think that the Amendment is not unimportant. The Clause deals with the change of name of parishes and puts an obligation upon the district council to give notice of any change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As we are to take Amendment No. 446, in Clause 77, page 49, line 5, after "council", insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the community and elsewhere".</p></blockquote>
with Amendment No. 445, I think that it might be as well to suspend the Sitting until 8.15 p.m.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.59 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my memory serves me correctly, I was drawing the Committee's attention to the fact that in Clause 76, which is concerned with "Change of name of parish", there is an obligation upon district councils to give
	<br><blockquote><p>"Notice of any change of name … to the Secretary of State, to the Director General of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0750">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1381</span>
he Ordnance Survey and to the Registrar General."</p></blockquote>
and also an obligation too that the proposal
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be published by the district council in such manner as they consider appropriate."</p></blockquote>
There is, however, no precise obligation upon the district council to tell the people most concerned in any change, namely, the people who live in the parish. Quite simply, the Amendment is aimed at remedying that situation. Unless my hon. Friend tells me that it is redundant or irrelevant in the light of a later provision in the Bill which I have not yet noticed, I hope he will feel able to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment. It seems, to develop a rather curious affinity between Lancashire and Wiltshire. I suppose that if Wiltshire can deal with matters of coal, Lancashire can deal rather more with matters of parishes, and not only with the rural parishes which we have in Lancashire at present. I also hope that when, under the Amendment which we are waiting for from the Government, we see the development of urban parishes in the urban parts of Lancashire and other parts of the country, this Amendment will be appropriate for urban areas as well as the rural areas at present contained in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be a change of name—and clearly when we move to urban parishes new names will have to be found for the urban parishes in our large cities and conurbations—it will be important for proper notice to be given of the names which are proposed and when changes arise. The possibility of a change of name in a rural parish is much less likely. The names of rural parishes are hallowed by time and history and are unlikely to be changed. On the other hand, I suspect that as we find better methods of defining our urban parishes, we may have to make changes from time to time. It may be that initially the new names will not be immediately acceptable or understood and there may have to be further changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that on Report the Minister will move Amendments to ensure that parishes cover some urban areas as well as the rural areas which they cover at present and that proper arrangements can be made for the publication within parishes of the changes of names of parishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the hon. Member for Devizes
	<span class='label label-info column'>1382</span>
(Mr. Charles Morrison) did not refer to this, I understand that with this Amendment we are also considering the Amendment to Clause 77 which would make the same provisions concerning communities within Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is imporant that we get the procedure with regard to names right. In the course of this Committee stage we have already had a number of debates on the names of areas. Perhaps I can put this in its right setting since it is important that the names, not only of counties and districts but of parishes as well, should be decided by the people of the locality. What will happen under the Bill to start off with is that in England the counties will be named in Schedule 1 of the Bill, the districts will be named in an order made by the Secretary of State and the rural parishes will continue as parishes with their existing names. In Wales the counties will be named in Schedule 4 to the Bill, the districts will be named in an order made by the Secretary of State for Wales and all boroughs and most urban districts will continue as communities with their existing names.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clauses 75 to 78 deal with the procedure for the changing of names of local authorities. Clause 75 deals with the change of name of a county, a district and a London borough. Clause 78 deals with the change of name in Greater London. In between, Clauses 76 and 77, to which these Amendments apply, deal with the change of name of a parish and the change of name of a community in Wales. If we manage to sort out the undertaking which has already been given, we may be giving names to fairly substantial towns and perhaps asking them to continue under their existing names or to find new ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was hesitant when, on reading the Clause again, I found that district councils were given the right, at the request of the parish, to name the parish. The parish may be an ancient borough with an ancient name. It is right to give this power to the districts at the request of the parish, but it must be well known and properly advertised to the population of the parish. For that reason the Amendments proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) appeal to me. The Bill provides that the district council can change
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0751">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1383</span>
the name of a parish or of a community at its request. The right is still in the district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill stands, the change is to be published
	<br><blockquote><p>"by the district council in such manner as they consider appropriate".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend's Amendment seeks to require this publication to be in the parish—or in the community if it is in Wales—and elsewhere. It would be sensible to publish, both by posting public notices in the parish or the community and by inserting a notice in the local papers as well as posting notices in the district offices and informing other parishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendments would provide some protection against too perfunctory a publication by the district council. We should ensure that a proper publication is made in the area affected by the change of name. I recommend the Committee to accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that we have discussed Amendment No. 725, and it would not be appropriate for me to refer to it again. However, before we accept the Clause I should like some elucidation from the Minister. I have never been able to discover why the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple as well as the City, should be included as local government areas.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are traditionally local government areas, with local government powers given to them over many years of statutes relating to local government.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 712, in Schedule 11, page 224, line 18, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>e</i>) regard shall be had to the number and distribution of the local government electors of the county and any change in either likely to take place within the period of five years immediately following the consideration;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>f</i>) regard shall be had to the boundaries of the wards of the districts in the county."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we are taking Amendment No. 713, in page 224, line 19, leave out sub-paragraph (3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two reasons for these Amendments. The first is partly semantic. I was never certain why in one case "regard has to be had" and in the other case the phrase is "so far as is reasonably practicable". I suppose that if one were to go through the Statutes one would find that this difference of wording had been used before. There is a difference between "so far as is reasonably practicable" and "regard shall be had to", but it seems a little odd. The Schedule says that regard shall be had to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the number and distribution of the local government electors"</p></blockquote>
even if it is not reasonably practicable to do so. The previous sub-paragraph says that certain things shall be done
	<br><blockquote><p>"So far as is reasonably practicable."</p></blockquote>
It seems an odd way of putting things. It may be time-hallowed, but it is still time-hallowed nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is only one semantic consideration. In saying that
	<br><blockquote><p>"So far as is reasonably practicable"</p></blockquote>
certain things should be done, one ought to include in that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regard shall be had to"</p></blockquote>
so that both factors are present. In other words, let us see whether something is reasonably practicable if it is to be considered. It may be that one ought to take into account certain other things but, clearly, they must be things that are reasonably practicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the sake of neatness I should have wished the two paragraphs to be put together, but I agree that it is pedantic to make an Amendment on those lines, and it may well be that the wording is time-hallowed, even if it is rather repellant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, a more substantial point. Under the sub-paragraph (2), con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0753">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1387</span>
sideration by the Secretary of State, or either of the Commissions, or the electoral arrangements for elections of county councillors has to take into account the number of local government electors. It says that as nearly as may be, they shall be the same in nearly every electoral division. That is fine. It then says that "every electoral division shall lie wholly within a single district". That too is splendid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"every ward of a parish or community having a parish or community council (whether separate or common) shall lie wholly within a single electoral division;"</p></blockquote>
Again, absolutely perfect. And then, finally:
	<br><blockquote><p>"every parish or community which is not divided into parish or community wards shall lie wholly within a single electoral division."</p></blockquote>
All that is very sensible and very much to the point, and I accept the provision
	<br><blockquote><p>"So far as is reasonably practicable"</p></blockquote>
because there may well be occasions when it is not practicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, let us take the third sub-paragraph. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regard shall be had to—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>a</i>) the number and distribution of the local government electors of the county and any change in either is likely to take place within the period of five years immediately following the consideration:"</p></blockquote>
Is that not something which ought to be considered "so far as is reasonably practicable"? In other words, if it is reasonably practicable to take into account the number and distribution of the local government electors of the county and any change over the next five years, then that ought to be considered. If it is not reasonably practicable to do that, it ought not to be considered. That could reasonably go in as new paragraph 1 (2)(	<i>e</i>)
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last of the four regards is
	<br><blockquote><p>"the boundaries of the wards of the districts in the county."</p></blockquote>
Those boundaries should be taken into account so far as is reasonably practicable. Therefore, those go in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My only quarrel is with sub-paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>). The former reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the desirability of fixing boundaries which are and will remain easily identifiable."</p></blockquote>
I do not know what the test would be, nor do I feel that when dealing with rather small, broken-down areas of local government that would necessarily be
	<span class='label label-info column'>1388</span>
much to the point. I do not think that one can fix boundaries of that sort. Ideally, if one is considering an area of local government and there are obvious boundaries—a kind of Berlin Wall, as it were—one might well agree that the boundaries ought to be there. But boundaries are not like that, and do not work in that way. My main experience has been in London, where the boundaries often lie between one side of a street and another and it is difficult to decide which is the actual boundary. Therefore, because the need for fixed and identifiable boundaries is not likely to occur very often, I do not think that this provision should be in the sub-paragraph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sub-paragraph (	<i>c</i>) looks very attractive, but I think that it needs rather deeper thought. It refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any local ties which would be broken by the fixing of any particular boundary."</p></blockquote>
The fixing of any boundary will always break a local tie. It is bound to do so because a boundary, by its nature, is a division between one area and another. Therefore, the sub-paragraph is again rather nonsensical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I am not giving the impression that I am pedantic and fussy. The wording is loose, but that is not my prime consideration. My first aim is to put certain fixed principles into the mind of the Secretary of State, or either of the Commissions, when they consider the arrangements for the election of county councillors. The Minister is fond of and it is therefore natural that here there are two-tier arrangements, two-tier regards, the first of which stipulates that matters have to be considered so long as it is reasonably practicable to do so, and the other which says whether or not it is practicable regard must be paid to it. That, again, seems to me totally nonsensical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will look at this again. I do not expect him to accept it off the cuff, because I doubt whether he knew what I was getting at, despite his long brief. Having destroyed half his case because of a misprint, I have great sympathy for the Minister. I should like him to take this away and look at it again. Though he may find strong reasons for not doing what I have suggested I think that he will have considerable sympathy with the wording which I have in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was impressed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0754">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1389</span>
when the Minister said that he wanted the Boundary Commission to be open and fair. I welcome the Schedule's clear statement about the abolition of rural weighting. The Minister was kind enough to supply us with notes dealing with this part of the Bill. This is something which has crept in since the 1933 Act, and it has given rise to considerable discrepancies and tensions in local government elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an area in South Gloucestershire with which I am very familiar there are rapidly-growing suburban areas which are bursting at the seams, and where electorates of 2,000-plus are returning one rural district councillor, while small, static parishes elsewhere, with an electorate of perhaps 100 to 180, also return one councillor, usually at an unopposed election. There is great frustration and tension in the suburban areas that representation is so heavily balanced against them, particularly when they face problems which arise from the very growth which is taking place. Our Amendments would go a long way towards redressing the balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the time of the Redcliffe-Maud Report hon. Members will have seen an article in New Society of 19th of June giving examples from other parts of the country. In Cumberland, the borough and urban districts returned one county councillor for every 3,125 electors while for rural districts the ratio is one to 2,115. I feel that for healthy local government this situation should not continue. I therefore welcome the laying down in black and white of this rule regarding the abolition of rural weighting, but I am very happy to support the Amendments moved by my right hon. Friend because they will remove from the list of considerations two things which I consider to be questions for subjective judgment rather than for objective judgment. In the first place the question of the fixing of boundaries, which will remain easily identifiable, is something which depends very much on the viewpoint of the observer. A friend of mine is an organiser for a union employing a large number of public employees, and when he drives me around London he can tell me when we are moving from one authority to another by the changes in lamp-posts or the fitments in the public lavatories, signs which can be interpreted only by a skilled observer
	<span class='label label-info column'>1390</span>
but to him represent easily identifiable boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not pursue that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is very much a question of who is looking at what, and I suggest that it is something which would be better removed from the consideration. Item (	<i>c</i>), the question of local ties, is even more capable of subjective interpretation. If the commissioners come into the area cold, so to speak, not knowing it except accidentally, the question of local ties will be something on which they will seek the opinion of interested bodies. This question of interested bodies is something that has rather disturbed me in our debates earlier today. I believe that very often these interested bodies are made up of a number of very articulate opinion-formers and may very well not be truly representative of the mass of the people in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore suggest to the Minister that these Amendments are worthy of further consideration, because they would codify the matter and give the commissioners a substantial yardstick by which to work, and remove the two areas in which matters are less easily brought down to a factual basis. They would, therefore, help the Boundary Commissioners in their job of establishing parity between urban and rural areas and make it easier to justify their decisions. I certainly support the removal of the areas in which subjective views can point in either one direction or another and keep it entirely factual. I hope that the Boundary Commissioners will interpret this provision in the spirit in which it has been laid down. If they do, it will be very healthy for the future of local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I turn first to the problem of semantics. There is a certain difference in emphasis between the two forms of wording, "So far as is reasonably practicable" and "Regard shall be had to". The first places a much greater emphasis upon what the Commission should take into account; the second is, in the light of the first, the consideration which the Commission should also have in mind. One could argue for hours about semantics, but that is probably the difference between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0755">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1391</span>
I now turn to the more substantial part. The effect of the Amendment would be to leave out sub-paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) of paragraph 1(3) that, first,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regard shall be had to … the desirability of fixing boundaries which are and will remain easily identifiable".</p></blockquote>
In constituencies like mine and that of the right hon. Gentleman, houses from No. 14 onwards in the same road may be in someone else's constituency. We may have to accept this in urban areas but it is not always desirable. Again taking my own constituency as an example, there is a clear division of a stream between the Maiden area and Kingston. It is extremely practical that where there happens to be such a stream, it is a clear division between the two areas. The same considerations apply in the Commission to parliamentary constituencies. There was a lot of argument about this when the 1958 Act was being passed. It was generally felt in the House that where there was a convenient boundary such as a railway or a stream, it was reasonable that the Commission should take it into account. The same thing applies in local government. In many cases, as the right hon. Gentleman said, it will not be practicable because there will not be a division, but where there is a division it is reasonable that the Boundary Commission should take it into account in fixing the boundary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second sub-paragraph which the Amendment would leave out is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any local ties which would be broken by the fixing of any particular boundary".</p></blockquote>
Again, in a wholly urban area it is very difficult to define local ties. As one moves out into country areas, local ties have a meaning. People may have associated themselves with a church parish. It is not unreasonable that the Boundary Commission should take this into account. The Committee should not underestimate the strong feedings in local communities about local ties. People sometimes feel very strongly about them. The further one moves away from the centres of the great conurbations, the more importance local ties have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have carefully considered what the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman have said but I believe it is right to leave the drafting as it stands, with the two divisions of those things which are of first importance and those which are
	<span class='label label-info column'>1392</span>
of secondary importance which can be taken into consideration. I do not say that the local railway line should be an overriding consideration, but if the local railway happens to be there it is right that it should be taken into account. It is easier to have the line of the local railway than to have to identify the lamp-posts. My advice is that this sub-paragraph of the Schedule should be left as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have got the hon. Gentleman's wording a little wrong—I am speaking from memory—but I thought he implied that paragraph (3) was subordinate to paragraph (2). That is not so. They may be linked because they refer to what the Secretary of State or the Commission has to take into account. But they are 	<i>pari passu.</i> The one is not subordinate or subject to the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must then say that there is a difference in wording, and if the wording of one is reasonably practicable one has to accept that. The other subsection must be taken into account whether it be reasonably practicable or not. This seems to me to be an absolute nonsense whichever way one looks at it. I suggest that if the Minister looks at it for the next couple of months—upside down or in any way he wishes—he will still find that that is the effect of the wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is that if the boundaries are set so obviously at the end of an urban area, or with no population in rural areas, and with no population likely to enter on one side or the other, that is where the boundary will be. It does not need to be put into the Bill. It must be mentioned only where there is doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us say that the Minister of State's "stream" is acting as a dividing line. Logic tells us that the area ought to go beyond the stream in terms of population, growth, and so on. My argument is that the reality of the situation ought to be the determining factor. The Minister may argue that it is so on this wording. In that event he will lose nothing by dropping the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of local ties, I hope that the hon. Gentleman did not misunderstand me. I was not saying that I was against local ties and did not believe in them; I merely said that any boundary is certain to cut local ties. The stream at the end of the hon. Gentleman's constituency probably divides one family from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0756">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1393</span>
another and one group of friends from another. He is not going to tell me that all his supporters and friends stop on one side of the stream and have nothing to do with people on the other side. If he did I would not believe him; nor would he believe himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since every boundary must cut across local ties it is a ludicrous provision to put into the Bill. I imagine that it will be done on the reality of the area. That is all I ask the Minister to ensure. I do not propose to press this matter to a vote, for the very good reason that these Amendments would be outstandingly rejected, and I do not want that to happen. I have every confidence that, given a little period of germination and a short time away from a departmental brief, the Minister of State will come round to the common sense point of view. In that sense, Sir Stephen, in due course I shall beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to pursue more than one point with the Minister, but it seemed to me that he conceded one of the points which I made. In his period of cogitation I ask him to look closely at his remarks. In dealing with the question of local ties he said that this did not apply in urban areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I said "possibly". It possibly applies more in rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. The Minister will agree that there is a continuum where the local tie gets stronger as one moves away from the urban area into the rural area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this instance we are saying that this factor is much more likely to occur in the rural areas as opposed to the urban areas, and that there is a possibility that in arriving at a judgment the commissioners will do something in a rural area which they would not consider doing in an urban area. Since it is very difficult for them to achieve the right balance we ought to take out of the equation anything that might be felt to work more in favour of one side—the rural side—than the urban side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to consider this matter carefully. If the abolition of rural weighting is, in the words of the Minister of State, "seen to be open and fair", it will be an extremely good thing, but we should try to block up every loophole
	<span class='label label-info column'>1394</span>
whereby the situation might be distorted, or thought to be distorted, even though the commissioners have worked with the best will in the world. If we are to abolish rural weighting, it should be done once and for all, and thoroughly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister intends to think about this matter again, will he consider one aspect where sub-paragraphs (3)(	<i>b</i>) and (3)(	<i>c</i>) appear to conflict? During the discussion hon. Members have probably been thinking about the way in which ward and electoral area boundaries are drawn in our constituencies. We know that in many urban areas they are drawn down the middle of a road. The middle of the road, as in sub-paragraph (3)(	<i>b</i>), remains easily identifiable. At the same time, sub-paragraph (3)(	<i>b</i>) automatically conflicts with sub-paragraph (3)(	<i>c</i>), in regard to the local ties which link people living on either side of the main road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in any draft that the Minister brings before the House on Report he will try to find some way to ensure that the Commission does not divide wards or electoral areas down the middle of a main road, thus dividing areas which are naturally linked by people who live on either side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Registrar-General draws up his enumeration districts for the purposes of a census he often includes the houses on both sides of a main road within the same district, because they have a natural affinity. Similarly, when electoral areas or wards are drawn up we should try not to divide areas which are naturally linked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to refer to subparagraph (3)(	<i>b</i>). Is it desirable to entrench in the Bill an undesirable aspect of social development? The Minister mentioned a railway line as a suitable boundary. We all know the expression about people coming from "either side of the tracks." In most spheres of local government—housing, education or health—there is a tendency for an area to become exclusive in one way or another. Either it is an area of predominantely council housing, or an area of a certain kind of private ownership, and so on. These things tend to develop naturally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One would only hope that, in local authorities, we would try, whenever possible, to arrange our electoral practices so that a councillor would cover the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0757">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1395</span>
widest posible range of opinion, economic and social make-up, etc., in an area. To enshrine the principle of what I should call divisiveness in the Bill is bad; it is almost equivalent to directing the Commission or the district council to look at clearly-defined barriers which may, if they are too rigidly adhered to for electoral purposes, later on in the life of a community—particularly with respect to the authority—divide it in a thoroughly undesirable way. I ask the Minister to bear that and the remarks of my hon. Friend in mind before he decides that this is a principle which should be enshrined in law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister worried me very much when he said that subparagraph (3) was subordinate to subparagraph (2). I am especially concerned about sub-paragraph (3)(	<i>a</i>) and, if subparagraph (3) is to be treated as of subordinate importance, I ask the Minister to consider whether sub-paragraph (3)(	<i>a</i>) should be promoted to sub-paragraph (2). I am already in correspondence with the Minister about the draft for our new county council, and he will be aware of the particular case which is in my mind where we already have an unequal electoral division which is growing very rapidly so that the inequality will become greater as the years pass. I should have thought it highly desirable, since this effects not only my constituency but many parts of the country, to pay attention to growth areas when the electoral provisions are being framed. We should pay attention to what is likely to happen during the next five years as an item of major importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the last point and to the semantic point raised by the right hon. Gentleman, certainly I will look at the semantics and will also see whether the particular considerations are in the right league and whether the wording is right. However, I think I should mislead the Committee if I did not remain absolutely firm on the question of the Commission being able to take into account the existence of a convenient physical boundary. It may be that when they are considering an area, there happens to be, say, a railway or the end of a street with one or two houses on one side or the other. I think it quite right that they should be allowed to take into con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1396</span>
sideration the fact that there is a physical boundary at that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overriding consideration—and this, I think, answers the point made by the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks)—is, of course, the question of the abolition of rural weighting. That is contained very clearly in paragraph 1(2)(	<i>a</i>). The first consideration is that the number of the local government electors shall be, as nearly as may be, the same in every electoral division. Following that, one takes into account all the other considerations. I think it reasonable that the Commissions should take into account physical boundaries and that they should be allowed to take into account, though it is not an overriding consideration, local ties which may exist. I think that it would be wrong wholly to exclude that, thus preventing their being taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Schedule states that the Commissions shall fake into account certain matters as far as is reasonably practicable. What follows is completely illogical because all the matters which are referred to as having compulsorily to be taken into account will automatically be taken into account. Surely, however, the Commissions will have other factors to consider and, if they are excluded from the list, the implication will be that the Bill does not require them to be looked at. I should have thought that it would be wiser to leave out sub-paragraph (3) because the items mentioned would in any case be included in the consideration, whereas putting them into the Bill would exclude other factors since it would be impossible for the Committee or the House to draw up an exhaustive list in advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is wrong. Parliament lays down the factors which the Commissions are able to take into account and I do not think that the Commissions will be able to take other factors into account. That is why it is right to write these factors into the Bill; the Commissions have to work very strictly within the law when considering their recommendations. That is why I think it right that, although they cannot give them top priority, they should take these other considerations into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is quite right. There is no difference of opinion
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0758">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1397</span>
here. They will take the matters into account, but I suggest that we have not the wisdom to foresee all the circumstances and factors which should be taken into account. Therefore, it would be much better to rely on the first part of the Schedule and to allow the Commission to take into account those factors and all others which might determine what could reasonably be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. Looking at the Parliamentary side, an argument which is often put forward is whether parliamentary Commissions should be allowed to take political factors into account. They are not able to do so and that is why I think it right that the factors which they are able to take into account should be clearly defined. They are not able to take other factors into account in deciding on the boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other point with which I wish to deal is the suggestion raised by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) that sub-paragraph (3)(	<i>a</i>) should appear under sub-paragraph (2). This is something which is not quite so clearly definable at the time when they make their assessment as are the other considerations in sub-paragraph (2). However, I will certainly consider whether it should appear in the top league or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that there is a great deal between us on these points, but I must make it quite clear that, while I am prepared to look at the semantics, the Committee should be under no illusion that I would recommend a change in the principle or in the main considerations outlined here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this side of the Committee we always go from principle to semantics, but we quite understand that the Government have to work the other way. However, we hope that in their examination of the semantics, they will return to the question of the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister reads what my hon. Friend the Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) has said, he will see that there is a great deal more in it than he thought. There is a legal maxim, which the Minister for Local Government well knows, which, because of the antipathy of my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) for things Latin, I
	<span class='label label-info column'>1398</span>
shall express in English, though it is not nearly so elegant; is is that the expression of one thing is the exclusion of the other thing. It means that, if one says that regard is to be had to something, everything else is to be disregarded. Again, I leave the Minister of State to muse over this for the next two months. It simply happens to be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the Minister's semantic undertaking, and in the hope of an undertaking on principle, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 773, in page 224, line 34, leave out "the London borough of".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee knows, the Schedule sets out rules to be observed in considering electoral arrangements and, under the heading of "Greater London", it sets out a rule that the whole of the City—which means the City of London as defined by Clause 248—and the Temples—which means the Inner and Middle Temples as defined by Clause 248 and, incidentally, I may tell the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper), by Section 82 of the London Government Act, 1963, which might save me writing him a very long letter—
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be included with part of the London borough of the City of Westminster."</p></blockquote>
Most of the areas in London are called London boroughs, but they acquired that name through charters and letters patent and the City of Westminster has that name without the preceding words, "the London borough of". It is quite wrong to speak of it as "the London borough of", so we must delete that to make the sub-section read,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The whole of the City and the Temples shall be included with part of the City of Westminster"</p></blockquote>
so that those two—the City and the Temples—from one electoral area. I should have started by saying that this is a drafting Amendment, which makes the wording of the paragraph correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
