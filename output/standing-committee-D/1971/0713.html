	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I recall correctly, when we rose on Tuesday the hon. Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones) was moving towards his peroration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you very much, Sir Stephen. I shall try to delay the Committee no more than five minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was expressing my complete dissatisfaction with our treatment of the long-term unemployed. I had explained that in areas like Rhondda high and long-lasting unemployment had been a permanent feature throughout the whole of my life. I indicated that nationally, today, 16½ per cent. of our men are unemployed for more than 12 months and, hence, that that large number lose their entitlement to unemployment benefit. I then indicated that inside the development areas, where the problem is much more serious, almost 25 per cent. had been unemployed for more than 12 months and had lost their entitlement to unemployment benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that as far as I could see—and I used the words of the Leader of the House, when he was the Minister of Employment—this problem was likely to become worse for a long time, since the Leader of the House gave an indication that he envisaged that unemployment would not drop below the half million mark for two years or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who lose their entitlement to unemployment benefit can apply for sup-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>448</span>
plementary benefit. This is the stock answer to all problems. But it indicates that one person in four receives no assistance at all. We want to know why. Obviously, some do not apply. Some may have resources of their own, but many do not apply because of the loss of dignity which a good many working people still associate with applications for means-tested supplementary benefit. Some have working wives—and this is not quite the innocent suggestion that it might seem. It is a serious blow to a man's dignity, when he has worked for about 40 years, has lost his unemployment benefit and has applied for supplementary benefit, to find that he becomes completely dependent upon his wife's earnings. The vast majority of working people, certainly those that I meet in my area, find this absolutely repugnant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In areas like Rhondda, where large numbers of miners and ex-miners receive payments for pneumoconiosis and other industrial diseases and injuries, the other benefits that they receive as a consequence are taken into account in assessing any supplementary benefit due to them. I know that there is a disregard, but the disregard is not complete, and it means that the extra allowances made to help men deal with the problem of pneumoconiosis has to be used in assessing the need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult for most of us to talk on these issues, because few people in this room will have had much experience of unemployment—certainly not unemployment lasting for a very long period. I think it is desperately important that the law of the land should take into account the feeling that exists among the long-term unemployed when they lose their unemployment benefits. To illustrate this. I quote from a report carried out in my constituency, about 12 months ago. relating to a long series of redundancies.
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the first twelve months after the closure Mr. C. received unemployment benefit … However, after twelve months his entitlement to unemployment benefit ceased, and he was advised to apply for … supplementary allowance. This was … refused because (of) … his wife's earnings …"</p></blockquote>
That is the important point.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. C. felt that this event, although seemingly trivial changed the whole complexion of his situation; for while he had contributed to the family income—even though it was unemployment benefit—he felt that he had still fulfilled his family rôle of financial provider. He realised that his financial contribution had
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0806">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>449</span>
been reduced, but felt that he had compensated for this, by carrying out certain household tasks … Mr. C. described his very real and meaningful feelings of degradation through being wholly financially dependent on his wife.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>… He reflected on the substantial amount of Taxes and National Insurance contributions he had paid over the years; his conscientious regularity of attendance at work, and his refusal to stay at home when ill. He felt that he had earned the right to be treated with more respect and consideration."</p></blockquote>
We are seeking to add a little more respect and to give a little more consideration to the long-term unemployed. The Prime Minister and the Conservative Party are fond of using the one-nation concept, and if that is the honest intention of the Government, I believe that our treatment of the long-term unemployed is moving in exactly the opposite direction. Short of re-introducing Clause 62—which I referred to last Tuesday—I hope that at least we can expect the Government to accept the new Clause, or something similar to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Mr. Paul Dean)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This discussion takes place against the sombre background of a level of unemployment far higher than anybody in the Committee would wish to see. Fortunately, the graph is beginning to move substantially in the right direction, and many Government policies are helping to create new jobs and ensure that training and re-training arrangements are expanded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, I want first to deal with some of the Figures that the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) asked me about when he opened the discussion—figures to which the hon. Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones) has also referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In May, 1972—the latest date for which figures are available—approximately 53 per cent. of the registered unemployed were receiving unemployment benefit, or unemployment benefit together with supplementary allowance. About 29 per cent. of the registered unemployed were receiving supplementary benefit alone; 82 per cent. were thus getting benefit of one kind or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting feature is that the proportion of unemployed people receiving benefit is fairly constant, and does not fluctuate much with the actual level of unemployment; that is particularly true for those who are unemployed for over
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>450</span>
12 months. In May, 1972, about 18 per cent. of registered unemployed persons were receiving neither unemployed benefit nor supplementary benefit. I was asked for some information about this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally, those would be people whose resources were such that they were above the supplementary benefit level, because they had resources of savings, in the case of the older men, or because they had occupational pensions. In some cases the claim for unemployment benefit would still be being processed and the persons concerned would not yet have received cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The following are the main categories of people not receiving unemployment benefit: those who have exhausted their entitlement to unemployment benefit—the latest figure being about 195,000—those who do not satisfy the contribution conditions because they were formerly self-employed or because they have recently left school or university; married women who had opted out of contributions, and those disqualified because they left their previous jobs voluntarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Clause seeks to extend the duration of unemployment benefit to 18 months instead of the present 12 months for flat-rate benefit, and to 12 months instead of the present six months for earnings-related supplement. When the earnings-related supplement was introduced in 1966 the previous Administration considered that six months was about right, in that it was long enough to enable people to look for a suitable job without too big a drop in their income, but not so long as to discourage unemployed people from seeking or accepting new jobs promptly. That was the philosophy behind it at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a change would have certain practical effects that the Committee should consider. First, the earnings-related supplement is taken fully into account in calculating supplementary benefit. Therefore, those unemployed persons whose financial needs are greatest would not benefit from increased expenditure on extending the duration of earnings-related supplement from six months to 12 months. In other words, such an extension would help those least in need rather than those most in need. The cost of extending the benefit would be about £10 million in the case of the earnings-related supplement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should mention briefly one other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0807">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>451</span>
practical factor, namely, the interchange-ability with sickness benefit. At present the earnings-related supplement payable during unemployment or sickness is the same, for administrative reasons, and it provides for the linking of claims for either benefit. The new Clause as it stands would disturb that, because it makes no new provision for interchange between the benefits. For instance, it is not clear what would be the position of a man who had been unemployed for nine months and then fell sick. Those are some of the practical difficulties involved in extending the earnings-related supplement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1966 the flat-rate benefit was fixed by the previous Administration at 312 days—that is, a year, excluding Sundays. Before 1966 a good contribution record gave title to up to 312 additional days beyond the standard 180 days. In going for a standard maximum of 312 days the Labour Government in 1966 argued that many people who got the additional days did not want further employment, or had adequate resources. That argument still holds good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When benefit is exhausted the supplementary benefit arrangements are available. We feel, as did the previous Administration, that the more flexible arrangements that are possible these are the most suitable means of covering those who, for one reason or another, have exhausted their benefit. All who are in benefit—whether through the national insurance arrangements or through the supplementary benefit arrangements—will of course gain from the uprating of the benefits, which comes into operation in October.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am asking the Committee to consider what, in the present circumstances, is the best way to help those who are unemployed, particularly those who have been unemployed for a fairly long period. I have mentioned what is being done through the national insurance scheme and the supplementary benefit scheme. It is equally important to take into account the redundancy payment arrangements that are in operation, the fact that unemployment is falling, and that through the Industry Bill the Government are about to launch a major new scheme to pump substantial additional resources into the regions that have problems of unemployment and shortage of jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there is the policy an-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>452</span>
nounced in the White Paper, Industrial and Regional Development, under which substantial additional resources and places are being made available for training and retraining. In 1971, it was 20,000. That figure will rise to between 60,000 and 70,000 by 1975. The training centres and allowances will involve additional expenditure of about £100 million in the next four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore submit to the Committee that the combination of the cover at present available and about to be uprated in the national insurance scheme, plus the major new advances in the field of regional development and training and retraining arrangements, will provide the most effective way of alleviating the existing problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian O'Maley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How sad it is that that is the best case that the Government can put forward for preventing long-term unemployed men receiving assistance from the State for a little longer. The hon. Gentleman and his Govrnment must be in hard straits if that is the most they can say, and if that is the best brief that the civil servants can give their Minister in defence of a situation in which we have such appalling unemployment. The new Clause is under discussion at a time when the level of unemployment is higher than at any time during the post-war period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) gave all the facts of the situation in the speech in which he moved the new Clause. He put forward strong arguments, pointing to the number of unemployed who were receiving no unemployment or supplementary benefit, and to the latest trends, which indicate that the proportion of people receiving unemployment benefit is declining, showing that the situation is not the stationary one described by the Under-Secretary this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also spoke of the vehement objection of many men, after a lifetime or half a lifetime of work, to having to rely on means-tested benefits to live. The Under-Secretary had nothing at all to say about that. He agreed that the level of unemployment was intolerable, yet he and his Government are not prepared to do anything about it. He said that the Labour Government had thought in 1966 that six months was the right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0808">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>453</span>
period for the payment of earnings-related benefit, and suggested that if we accepted the proposal in the new Clause to extend that period it would cost £10 million—as though that was something that the Government and the country could not possibly afford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman needs to be told that the position in 1966, when the decision about the period over which supplementary earnings-related benefits should be payable was taken, was very different from that which exists today. Even if it were not, no decision in this field is immutable; a decision is taken according to the economic circumstances prevailing at the time and in the light of the nature, extent and duration of the unemployment prevailing. When circumstances change there is no reason why a Government should not re-examine the structure and the period over which benefits are paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1966, the situation has changed yearly. For example, in July, 1968, there were 74,000 men and women who had been unemployed for between 26 and 52 weeks. That figure fell to 68,000 by July, 1969, but then started to rise again, particularly under the present Government. Last year, the figure of 102,000 was reached by July and, according to the latest figures, the level has now reached 166,000. Those are the different circumstances which require the Government to consider whether the length of period for which earnings-related benefit is payable should be increased beyond the present six months. The circumstances are very different from what they were in 1966.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the unemployment figure is very high today, but surely to the individual unemployed man the circumstances are exactly the same as in 1966. It is the individual that we must think about, though the total global figure is clearly a great problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two things that I would say to the hon. Gentleman. First, the possibility of being unemployed for a period of over 26 weeks, or even over a year, is now much higher than it was when the earnings-related scheme was brought in. Secondly, with regard to the individual, it is clearly easier for the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>454</span>
Government to extend the period. If the hon. Gentleman will recall the economic pressures of 1966 and the problems confronting the Government of that time and will compare them with the economic situation in 1971–72, he will see there is plenty of scope for making improvements of this kind, through public expenditure and the national insurance system, which was not possible during the earlier period. The Parliamentary Secretary tried to explain why many unemployed people receive neither unemployment benefit nor supplementary benefit. He suggested that the reason was that they had capital of one kind or another and were not driven to apply for means-tested benefit; they were all right. But is that so? I want to quote a letter from a Bournemouth man, received in June by myself and the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle)—who speaks for the Labour Party on social security matters. It is one of many such letters that we have received from people from all over the country. I quote the letter extensively to rebut the hon. Gentleman's implication that the reason why many unemployed people do not draw supplementary benefit is that they do not need it. The letter asks:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Would it be possible for you to bring it to the notice of the house, of the position I now find myself in, not only me but thousands of others.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I sold my house in London to come and work in Bournemouth. The money was invested in a Building Society (£2,500) which at a later date on my retirement would have helped me to move and live nearer my sons.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I am now nearly 63 and for the past 14 months have been unable to get employment because of my age.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I am now out of unemployment Benefit for myself and my wife and am now on a Supplementary Benefit of £4.40 per week."</p></blockquote>
This gentleman is now on reduced supplementary benefit.
	<br><blockquote><p>"I appealed and have been told because of the Law I have to use all my Capital. We are living in a rented flat. If I had £10,000 in property I could claim the full Benefit. With inflation is this Justice in a democratic society?"</p></blockquote>
That is the kind of problem which the hon. Gentleman is skating over so easily when he talks about the people who are not entitled to supplementary benefit, let alone unemployment benefit. The hon. Gentleman moved on from the question of the earnings-related benefit to say that the 312 days' entitlement for flat-rate benefit was established in 1966 by a Labour Government, and that for those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0809">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>455</span>
who received it there was an uprating in the autumn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation has changed since 1966. The prospect of being unemployed for longer than 312 days, or even for longer than 12 months, has grown enormously each year. In July, 1968, nearly 85,000 had been unemployed for over 52 weeks. By 1970 that figure had risen to 96,000; in July, 1971 it was 118,000, and in April, 1972 no fewer than 157,000 men and women had been wholly unemployed for more than a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know the reasons for that. These people are not the scroungers; they are not the malingerers of whom an hon. Member on the Government side made so much play before the last General Election. These are men whom we all see in our constituency advice bureau—if we have them. They are men who are breaking their hearts because they are afraid that they will never work again. There are men like that in my area. I come from the valleys of South Yorkshire, where we have coal and steel. In those valleys and in my constituency I see streams of such men.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A man came into my advice bureau in the town hall only a few weeks ago. He was 56. He had been unemployed from the age of 53 because of redundancy in the steel industry. All that he wanted was a job. It is intolerable that the best we can say to men like him, who have worked in heavy industry in whatever capacity, with little time off during their working lives—men who have been thrown prematurely on the scrap-heap—is, "You will get 312 days' flat-rate unemployment benefit and six months' earnings-related unemployment benefit"—which they have paid for anyway—"and we can do no more for you. The best you deserve is to be sent to the supplementary benefit offices."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not attack the supplementary benefit offices. Their staffs have a difficult job to do. But I do not want large numbers of men and women to have to rely on supplementary benefit. Many of them resent having to be means-tested, particularly at a time when we can afford to help without doing damage to the economy. One of the problems in the last few years has been lack of purchasing power, particularly at the bottom end—among the old-age pensioners, the unemployed and the sick. When we consider how insignificant the cost is compared
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>456</span>
with the whole range of Government expenditure—even that of the Department of Health and Social Security alone—and when we see just how much help the Government are giving to some quarters of our community, we are entitled to tell the Minister that bis reply will not do. Some are men in the constituencies of hon. Gentlemen opposite will have been unemployed for more than 12 months and will have lost their earnings-related benefits because they have been unemployed for too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only the other night I saw on television a number of Conservative M.Ps marching with workers in a demonstration about the proposed closure of a plant by Newton Chambers. I wonder what those workmen expect their constituency Members of Parliament to do? That area of the country will find as I have found in my own area that, when substantial redundancies occur in heavy industry particularly, and in times like these when a technological upheaval is taking place, it is very difficult to provide employment for those men within any reasonable time. Some of them may get jobs, probably worse paid jobs than they have ever had previously, but there will be a hard core who will probably never have the opportunity to work again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.00 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, what we are asking for for men like that, men with that shadow of unemployment over them, as well as the many who are already unemployed, many elderly men whose prospects of employment under the policies of the present administration are remote—without attacking the economic or regional policies of the Government—is that hon. Members on the Government side should look again at what we are proposing. Here are men and women in Great Britain who want to work but cannot get a job. Some of them will never get a job again. Some of them are probably condemned once their unemployment benefit has run out, as things stand now, to permanent means testing throughout the rest of their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances, because of the changed structure of unemployment, because of the regional difficulty, because of technological change in industry, do not hon. Gentlemen opposite think that there is not only a case, but an overwhelming case, for trying to persuade the Minister this morning or before Report
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0810">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>457</span>
to accept the proposition in new Clause 3? Let us persuade him not to make the unemployed suffer that sharp drop with the loss of earnings-related benefit after six months, because their prospects of getting jobs during that period are worse than they have been for some years, but to extend the period of entitlement to flat-rate unemployment benefit, because there are literally thousands of older men whose chances of getting a job in the present climate are absolutely remote. The Clause would do good in this country, and no harm to the Administration which those on the other side support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause looks rather complicated, but it is not. By it and Amendment No. 85 we seek to increase the amount payable to recipients of the maternity grant and death grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will remember that we have had an earlier debate in which we on this side sought to relax the contribution conditions for maternity benefit so that the minority of people—for example,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0811">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>459</span>
unmarried mothers and wives of prisoners—who are now not entitled would receive such benefit. We were turned down by the Government. Similarly, there have been previous attempts by the Opposition to relax the conditions under which death benefit is payable. We are not now seeking to relax those conditions to bring into entitlement people who would not be so entitled under the existing arrangements, but simply seeking to increase the amount payable to those who under the existing contribution and benefit structure are entitled to maternity benefit or to death grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that there have been a number of Parliamentary Questions on the Order Paper on the subject of death benefit in recent months because of the ever increasing cost of funerals under the present Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 85 seeks to increase the maternity grant from £25 to £35—the figure of £25 having stood since the 1969 Act. We also seek to increase the death benefit according to age to a maximum figure of £70, whereas the maximum figure in Schedule 4 of the 1965 Act, as amended by the 1969 Act, was £30.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The facts on which the Committee has to make a judgment are not in dispute. First, the maternity grant in this uprating is excluded. It has been the case since 1965 that the maternity grant has gone up at longer intervals than the weekly benefits. The "recent" increases—of maternity benefits were from £14 to £16 in 1963, to £22 in 1965, and to £25 in 1969. There was no increase in 1971.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question which one has to ask the Government is why they take the view that the maternity benefit should not be uprated along with other National Insurance benefits. As both the Under-Secretary and myself pointed out on an earlier Amendment, whatever the contribution conditions this has been a National Insurance benefit of a kind in this country since 1911. Successive Governments of both political parties have not uprated the maternity benefit every time there has been a general uprating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation now lies in the past and all that the Government need to explain now is why they have not uprated the maternity benefit. Whatever may have happened under Labour or Conservative Governments in the past, do the present Government think that there is a case for raising the maternity benefit when all the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>460</span>
other benefits are being up-rated?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly, the maternity benefit has fallen behind other benefits in comparative terms. In 1965, it was 5½ times the weekly rate of benefit for a single person. To restore that relationship, the maternity grant would have to be raised to over £37. The Amendment seeks very modestly to raise it from £25 to £35. Hon. Gentlemen—for whose support we look on the off-chance that the Government do not accept the Amendment—will therefore realise that we are prepared to compromise. We have not asked for the full £37.12½ but only for £35. In view of rising prices and the increased costs of maternity, I think that there is a case for increasing the maternity benefit on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now make some similar observations on the death grant, which is also excluded from the uprating. In 1949, it was £20. It was increased to £25 in 1958 and to £30 in 1967. I refer to the highest death grant, payable for an adult: the grants payable for younger people are clearly 	<i>pro rata.</i> The main weekly benefits are over five times what they were in 1949, and I understand that the cost of funerals has risen roughly proportionately. I have looked at my own family files on this matter and, sad to say, there have certainly been very substantial increases in the cost of burials over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will comment, as I do not have the full facts. I am informed that in the 'forties and early 'fifties undertakers were obliged, by an agreement within their trade association, to provide a funeral for the amount of the death grant, and that at that time they were able to do so. From my own experience of the cost of funerals—the very sad and occasional one that I suppose is the experience of most hon. Members—I should not have thought that one could be buried on the present death grant. I wonder what the general situation is now, and whether the undertakers association, if that is the correct title, still has such an agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general proposition is very simple. The cost of living has risen. It is more expensive than it used to be to give birth to a child and buy the things that children need, and it is even more expensive to die. In the circumstances, I think that we are entitled to an explanation from the Government, particularly since hardship
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0812">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>461</span>
clearly arises from the level of the death grant. I hope that the hon. Gentleman can do something to help us here and that if he cannot go the whole way and accept the figures in the Schedule he will undertake to consider the position before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation regarding the death grant is reflected by Questions in the House. Hon. Members say that that is just a straw in the wind, but when hon. Members from different parts of the country begin to put the odd Question, as is happening with the death grant, it is a sure sign that complaints are being made and that people are experiencing real difficulty. This is not the sort of situation that produces a queue of people at advice bureaux asking for the Government to do something about the death grant: it does not happen like that, as we all know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dissatisfaction, and difficulties are being caused, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be able to do one of three things. The best would be for him to accept the new Clause, but, failing that, perhaps he could give a general statement of the Government's policy, explaining why these benefits are not to be increased along with others at every uprating. Alternatively, we should view very favourably any offer to review the position and come forward with new and generous figures on Report, so that people receiving maternity and death grants could be given a little more assistance from the national insurance system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Under-Secretary replies I should like to tell him what can occur, and what did occur in my family. Leaving aside the need for an improvement in the maternity grant, events relating to which also happen fairly frequently in my family circle, I want to dwell specifically on the death grant. I should like the Under-Secretary to appreciate what can happen before he replies, though I do not suppose that he will make an electrifying change of attitude in consequence of my hon. Friend's speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It can happen that one is informed that a long-lost relative has died and that when one investigates his circumstances one finds that although there were fairly good
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>462</span>
provisions for a pension under a supplementary scheme there is no provision for a lump sum to be paid in the event of death. I did not know that such a thing could occur until my family had that experience recently. People of very moderate means, who may not have seen the dead person for thirty or forty years, have either to give the hospital instructions to dispose of him as best it can or face the responsibilities of the family circule and give him a decent burial. The matter of the death benefit therefore figures seriously in deciding what can reasonably be done in such circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new Clause, like that which we have just discussed, illustrates the degree to which it is possible to make out a good case for increasing almost any benefit under the national insurance scheme. I have the rather sad job of having to tell the Committee that Governments have to select priorities in allocating the resources available to them. That is a difficult decision for Governments, but, as the hon. Gentleman knows, these choices have to be made. Against that general background I should like to say a word about the points made by the two previous speakers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the new Clause and the Schedule would be to increase the maternity grant by 40 per cent.—from £25 to £35; the standard rate of death grant by 133 per cent.—from £30 to £70, and the reduced rate of death grant payable to children and juveniles by percentages ranging from 455 to those under three to 211 to those between 10 and 17 years. The total cost of the proposals would be about £34 million—£9 million on maternity grant and £25 million on death grant. That is the extent of the additional money with which we are dealing in the new Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a strong case. He said that the cost of maternity and burials has increased—and I accept that. We were back to the harsh reality of having to decide what were the most urgent needs to meet in the uprating Bill of this year. On that basis we decided, after careful consideration, that on this occasion it would be better to allocate additional resources to improving the attendance allowance and to the uprating of the main grants in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The maternity grant of £25 is a con-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0813">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>463</span>
tribution towards the general expenses of confinement. It may be paid either on the mother's own insurance or on her husband's, but not on both. The purpose of the grant is not to meet day-to-day living costs but to help towards the special expenses of preparing for a new baby and the actual cost of the confinement. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is not the practice to uprate this grant nearly as frequently as the main benefits within the scheme. Between March, 1963 and November, 1969—a period of six-and-a-half years—there was no increase in the amount of grant for mothers confined at home. For those confined in hospital the rate stood at £22 for almost five years—from January, 1965 to November, 1969. In other words, recent practice has been to alter the grant much less frequently than the main benefits of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a somewhat similar pattern, although a longer interval, with regard to the death grant. The rate of grant was £20 in 1949. It was increased after an interval of nine years, to £25 in 1958, and then to £30 in 1967—another interval of nine years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether there was still an agreement with the National Association of Funeral Directors. The answer is yes. The National Association agrees a maximum charge for funerals of minimum standards. I accept that these figures have been rising over the years. A new minimum charge of £69.75 has just been announced for 1972–73.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government studied very carefully the maternity and the death grants when we were considering the order of priorities for expenditure within the resources available this year. We felt that the other priorities—the raising of the main levels of benefit, which, of course, assist with maternity and with cover before the event of death—were the right ones, together with the improvements that have been made for that hitherto neglected section of the community—those in receipt of attendance allowance. The extension of the allowance will be in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that we shall consider sympathetically the death and maternity grants in the future. But we felt that on this occasion, given the inevitable limitation of resources, it was better to concentrate the additional money in the way that we have in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>464</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Government's priorities. I also disagree with them strongly. Unless the Government arc pushed hard the hon. Gentleman clearly has no intention of doing anything. I must therefore start exercising priorities within the Clause and ask him to consider at least one aspect of the matter before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clearly the case that at least a maternity grant on real insurance standards—where there should be cover against the rate of inflation—should be increased. But with a Government who are clearly not prepared to budge an inch, if I were driven to make a choice in the hope of getting a little from them I would have to exercise a priority in respect of the death grant for elderly people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has quoted figures which are absolutely horrifying. The death grant payable under Schedule 4 of the 1965 Act, as amended, is £30. Let us take the case of a married couple—elderly people with no resources, receiving their retirement pension, supplementary pension and help with their rent. Let us suppose that one of them dies. They are proud people, and the husband has worked all his life. A death grant of £30 is payable. A funeral of minimum standards, on the agreement which the hon. Gentleman has mentioned, costs £69.75. So, at a time of great sadness, the partner—that old man, or old woman—in order to bury the person who has died has to go to supplementary benefit for help. We should not tolerate that kind of situation in the '70s of the 20th century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall certainly wish to return to this question on Report, because it opens up some enormous questions. The House must be more compassionate than this. If the hon. Gentleman is not prepared to accept the maternity grant, we are absolutely right and justified in talking about priorities, if he is talking about priorities. These are not priorities that I like, but they are forced upon me by the Government's priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman is not prepared to budge on the question on maternity grants, or give us the £70 death benefit, before Report will he—without committing himself—ask his Department to see whether there is any way in which help can be given with death grants? It is awful to think that a retirement pensioner—widow or widower—can only bury his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0814">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>465</span>
or her partner only by relying on the Supplementary Benefit Commission. If the hon. Gentleman will merely look at the question of the death grant for older people—though I do not see how he could do this—he will find that there is a terrible case to be answered. It is an awful indictment of the system, whichever Government operates it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I advise my hon. Friends to vote on the new Clause and on Amendment No. 85, but I should advise them to do that much more softly if the hon. Gentleman could say that before Report, and entirely without commitment, he would consider the question of death benefit, bearing in mind the position of elderly people. Is the hon. Gentleman prepared to do even that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, as always, is very persuasive. I certainly agree to reconsider the death grant. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that it must be without commitment, however. It is extremely easy—and entirely proper—for hon. Members to make out strong cases for improvement in individual grants. Unfortunately, Governments have to face the harsh reality of the situation; they have to decide, within the limits of the resources available—on this occasion in the first of our annual reviews—what is the best use for those resources. That Bill, plus the accompanying improvements, makes available £500 million additional money to those who are in receipt of benefits. I must ask the Committee to bear that in mind, but I shall certainly respond to what the hon. Gentleman has said. I agree, without commitment, to reconsider the death grant between now and Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>finements in the home today is down to almost 2 or 3 per cent. That makes a difference in priority.

I feel honoured to have been asked to move the Amendment, especially as it might be the one real, genuine and serious departure from the Bill that we obtain from the Under-Secretary. It provides that the provisions of paragraph 10 of Schedule 1, relating to retirement pensioners, shall come into force with retrospective effect from the first pay day in June, 1972. In arithmetical terms, we took it as 16 weeks—in other words, it represents 16 weeks' back pay on the 75p increase in the single pension, which will rise under the terms of the Bill from £6 to £6.75, payable on 2nd October, and on the existing pension for a couple—that is, in respect of a single pensioner and his dependent wife—which will go up from £9.70 to £11.10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that those figures are correct. They are mentioned in the first part of the Reports of the Government Actuary on the Financial Provisions of the Bill. The rate will rise by £1.20, to £10.90 for a married couple, in October. I am aware that the Committee has already debated the whole question of old-age pensions, and how we believe that we should move</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>on to a new situation in which these pensions become related to national average earnings as distinct from just a neat cost-of-living increase under the yearly reassessment provisions, or review provisions or, as in the past, under the two-yearly reassessment provisions.</p>
	<p>After the Chancellor used the occasion of the presentation of his Budget last spring to announce the forthcoming niggardly increases in the basic State retirement pension level I put down an early day Motion calling for the immediate payment of this additional benefit. It attracted wide support amongst hon. Members of the Labour Party. I am sure that if I had pushed it hard enough we would have got many more signatures on that proposal and hon. Members on the Government side would have expressed the same desire.</p>
	<p>An early day Motion is only a proposal, and should not be identified completely as an Opposition Amendment to the Bill as it stands in Committee at the present time.</p>
	<p>Just after that, as a symptom of feelings on this matter, the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Eddie Griffiths) put down an early day Motion calling for the retrospective payment of this money. Now we have the third part of the proposition, in that we are modestly asking the Government to consider making the payment retrospective to first payout day in June. I am no statistician—and mathematics were not my strong point when I left school at 14—but if we call it 16 weeks it would mean that for a £6 pensioner of the moment—going up to £6.75 in October—an additional £12 would have to be paid.</p>

wife who draws her pension element in respect of her husband's pension entitlement, it would be £19.20, doubled. That is a modest sum but it would be very welcome.</p>
	<p>The Under-Secretary has defended the idea that the Chancellor makes an announcement in the spring of an increase in pensions to be paid in the autumn, and has said he thinks it appropriate that the increases should be made at the onset of winter. If the onset of winter is supposed to be a grim prospect—and it is a grim prospect for many of our old people-it would be additionally welcome. In fact, if the hon. Gentleman had been fortified with this kind of armoury when he addressed his meeting at Port Talbot yesterday, he would not have been given the bird by the old-age pensioners as one report in the Press said he did. That may be misreporting, but we were not all with the hon. Gentleman at Port Talbot yesterday.</p>

grant South Wales people who were driven to the London area in the thirties by unemployment, and the scourges of that period. Many of them now occupy prominent positions in the local movement in the London area, and we are grateful to history in that sense only for having provided us with this great area of talent, which means so much in our constituency Labour parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I started to try to work out the totality of the costs, but I gave it up. It must necessarily be a fairly modest global sum if sets in the national budgetary consideration. The Under-Secretary will no doubt inform the Committee on this score, but in all honesty I think that he will agree that when giving a neat figure of estimated costs in a proposal Governments seldom give an indication of any offsetting factors that might arise. Sometimes those offsetting factors are difficult to measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Ten-Minute Bill, to which I alluded extensively in my earlier presentation of the Schedule to that Bill, received a measure of support from the Government side of the Committee, I was thrilled about that. The hon. Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford) did not vote, but his arguments indicated that he was making a principled abstention. Both sides of the Committee are a little depleted at the moment, but I know where the heart of the hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) lies in this matter; the question is, where does the heart of the Under-Secretary lie and, more especially, that of the Secretary of State?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Norwich, South is not here this morning, because I think that we would have won a serious recruit to our side of the argument had he been present. He would have found it difficult not to vote in favour of our Amendment, unless the Under-Secretary was itching to intervene to say that the Government were prepared to look at the question sympathetically and might make an announcement on Report. However, that appears not to be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Mr. Fortescue) will know that many people in the Liverpool area, from a larger fraternity than the old-age pensioners themselves—their sons and daughters—would dance for joy if this kind of announcement were made by the Government. The stock of the Prime Minister would also rise. I should not want it to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0817">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>471</span>
rise, but it would, inevitably, because the people as a whole would like to see this action taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the opinion polls the Prime Minister's stock is going down to something like zero rating. In consequence, the stock of the Leader of the Opposition continues to rise. Perhaps they would knock away a peg or two by an announcement of this kind. I am sure they would. If that is what they want to do, and they do it with little cost—if that is what is worrying them—it will not make the stockbrokers and the profit dealers and land speculators shiver in their shoes. Far from it. They might even put up the rate of the £ a peg or two in relation to the exchange with the dollar. If the Government's stock rises, inevitably the stock of the £ rises in the international exchange markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what kind of reply we should have from the Under-Secretary. If at any stage he wishes to intervene, we may be able to curtail our proceedings. I do not want to talk for the sake of it, but in order to try to persuade him and his hon. Friends of the justice of our proposals. The Under-Secretary said earlier that the Government are now on the right course to reduce unemployment. I mention this, because the report by the Government Actuary on the financial provisions of the Bill alludes in one part to the effect on the contributions of putting men to work. The Committee will be interested to hear that the Actuary says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A higher rate of increase in earnings would improve, and a lower rate would worsen, the position of the Fund to the extent of about £1 million in 1972-73, and £15 million in 1973–74."</p></blockquote>
There was a worsening for each change of 1 per cent. in the rate assumed
	<br><blockquote><p>"A change of 100,000 in the assumed level of unemployment would alter the balance of income and outgo by about £50 million in 1972–73 and by about £55 million in 1973–74."</p></blockquote>
The Under-Secretary has told us that the Government are now getting the economy right and that the unemployment figure will drop considerably. We know by asking Questions of the Prime Minister on the Floor of the House, and by asking the Secretary of State for Employment, and other Ministers, that they are not prepared, understandably, to give us a forecast of by how much the national unemployment figure will drop this year. That figure is pertinent to whether we can afford this present small proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>472</span>
Is it not pertinent to suggest that if a drop in unemployment of 100,000 puts another £50 million in the kitty from employer, worker and State contributions to the National Insurance Fund, a reduction of 200,000, on the actuarial report assumption, puts £100 million in the kitty? That is the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from that, even ignoring arithmetical calculations of this kind, it is what the people want. We have paid some attention to the relationship between pension and national average earnings. I pointed out earlier that we do not know what the strike of the national average earnings will be this autumn—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows that, although he is being skilful in relating his arguments to the Amendment, the path he is at present pursuing will take him outside it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand, Sir Stephen, particularly at this stage of the proceedings, the general feeling that this might be our concluding sitting, and I understand your anxiety on that score. But I want to show that this question is related to the central argument of whether this proposal is feasible. The question whether it ought or ought not to be done on moral and practical grounds centres a great deal on these considerations of anticipated rises in the cost of living. The rise in the cost of living cannot be divorced from increases in the levels of earnings because that must necessarily affect the rise of prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policy, which they did not choose, of floating the £ must also relate to the prospect of what the price level will look like in the autumn, and to whether this money which I want to put in the pockets of the old-age pensioners in the autumn will be extravagant in the setting of what is likely to come. One does not have to look in the crystal ball: one can read the book. We have been through inflation before. We know how that effects import prices, not initially but later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those will be biting in the autumn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to exaggerate. The right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister, replying on Tuesday to my Question about his meeting with the TUC and the consequential effects of increasing import prices on the cost of living in this country, accepted that there would be consequential
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0818">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>473</span>
effects—we all have to accept that but that the TUC people were realistic and were not prepared to exaggerate the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to labour that point. It stands out a mile. Ours is a smallish proposal. It is something which ought to cut across party boundaries. I am sorry that hon. Members supporting the Government are not present at the moment because I wanted to address them one by one, but I shall mention them in their absence because they are members of the Committee, and will later float in, presumably to vote against this proposal, which I will seriously recommend to my hon. Friends to press to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Member for Wells, whose contributions have been extremely valuable, and who exhibits the large element of compassion and tries to get his balances as well as his priorities right, is morally on our side. The hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. McCrindle) is an expert on contributory pension schemes and superannuation matters as they apply to companies. He knows very well that I am talking about people who did not have the advantages and benefits of being employed in industries and occupations where they could build up and achieve a decent pension entitlement. It is people of that kind about whom I spoke hitherto and about whom I am now talking. I can picture them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has no right now to turn down a proposal from this side unless the Minister tells us that he is prepared to look at it seriously, and tell us so on Report. He does not look like Scrooge: he merely acts like him in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman described this as a modest Amendment and asked me what the cost would be. It would be far from modest. The cost of making retrospective payments for the retirement pension from 1st June this year, as the Amendment requests, would be £90 million this year. The hon. Gentleman in fact referred to all the benefits. The cost in that case would be £150 million this year, a very substantial addition to the large amounts already involved in the Bill. I appreciate that supplementary benefit is not in the Bill, but the same would have to be done there
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>474</span>
if we were to avoid the old dreary position of giving with one hand and taking away with the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are being asked to accept this very substantial additional cost in a year when for the first time ever we are on annual reviews. It will be only 13 months, from September last year to October this year, since the last increase. That is the shortest period ever. I therefore suggest that this is a singularly inappropriate year in which to suggest substantial additional costs of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the proposal for annual reviews was announced, we considered what was the best time of the year for the improvements to be made. We felt that the onset of winter was the most appropriate time. This year it will be October. As from next year, we propose that it should be November. I think that that is the time of year when the increases are most appropriate and most needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, serious administrative problems would arise. I have rarely used administrative arguments in the Committee, but they are extremely relevant to this proposal. Any uprating is a massive operation, as I am sure the Committee appreciates. Complex questions and administrative procedures are involved, covering many hundreds of different rates of benefit, and very large numbers of people are involved. The operation takes a considerable amount of time and involves a substantial amount of work on the part of all concerned, in the local offices, in the central offices and in headquarters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will describe briefly some of the administrative problems involved in such an operation. It would be necessary to calculate arrears according to the beneficiary's basic entitlement during the arrears period. Many will have come on to or gone off the books, and their entitlement will have changed during that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Separate calculations would have to be made for people who had retired during that period. A number of people would have died during that period. There would be some whose rate of benefit would have altered once or twice, or more, because of the operation of the earnings rule while they were drawing the retirement pension. There would be people who had gone into hospital, and whose benefits had been reduced as a result. Others coming out of hospital would have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0819">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>475</span>
had their benefit increased. Those are just a few examples of the enormous administrative burden involved in such a proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the regular payment of long-term retirement benefits is now carried out by a computer at our central office in Newcastle-upon-Tyne—no doubt the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. O'Malley) has seen this in operation—allowing 13-week order books to be produced in a highly mechanised form. There is thus no readily available way of making single payments to the 5½ million pensioners who are paid regularly through the computer in Newcastle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also the problems involved in the supplementary benefit arrangements. The reassessments of supplementary benefit arrangements are being carried out in the local offices. All that work would have to be done again, adding enormously to the administrative complications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite apart from the merits or demerits of the case, it would be physically impossible to carry out an operation of this kind without jeopardising that payment of the increased benefits in the first week of October which I am sure the whole Committee desires. It would be quite impossible to keep to that date. Either we should have to hold up bringing the increased payments into operation or the retrospective payments sought by the hon. Gentleman would come into operation a great deal later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, on the grounds of cost, on the grounds that this is the first of the annual upratings and that the improvement in October will come only 13 months after the last improvement, and on the grounds of the administrative considerátions that I have outlined, I cannot advise the Committee to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is entirely appropriate that my hon. Friend the Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell) should have moved the Amendment, although it stands in all our names. He has always shown a particular compassion for old people and retirement pensioners, and he has taken innumerable parliamentary initiatives on their behalf. As he said, he was responsible for the Early Day Motion in the Order Paper which expressed an extensive feeling in the House of Commons that we had been unfair to the old and to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>476</span>
poor in making them wait until October of this year for any financial help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister put forward what he regarded as a powerful administrative argument. Not least, he concluded with what he knew would be a telling remark for us—that our Amendment would delay the uprating. That is clearly the opposite of our intention. But the administrative difficulties that he mentioned are of his own making. The demand that something be done immediately for the old age pensioners was voiced last winter. It was voiced by the National Council of Labour. It was voiced by powerful trade unions. It was voiced in the House by my hon. Friends. Already last winter the plight of the old was on the conscience of the nation. We called upon the Government to do something immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman rightly says that we now have an annual review. He argued that that fact made this "a singularly inappropriate year" to put forward a proposition of this kind. What he forgets—and we have had to remind him of this time and time again—is, first, that the Government were compelled to introduce an annual review because this has been one of the most singularly inflationary years in our history. There is no doubt, I am afraid, that the Government would never have moved—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must remind the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) that the reading of newspapers in the Committee is not allowed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is looking up evidence to vindicate our point. We cannot open a newspaper these days without finding further evidence of the rate of inflation with which we are being engulfed. We may make it a nice debating point, but the disastrous rise in the cost of living is not a debating point to the old-age pensioner. It is literally a point of life and death.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a singular year with regard to this new hazard of inflation for the old. That is why we asked the Government last winter to take exceptional action. We pressed them to introduce an emergency winter payment, as the Labour Government had done in October, 1964. We asked them to do something immediately. As the hon. Gentleman said, winter is the right time of the year to give that extra help. We asked
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0820">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>477</span>
them to do it by an increase in the long-term addition. We asked them passionately to look at the derisorily small heating allowances, which meant that many old people last winter had to go to bed in the afternoons because they could not keep warm. These are not just propaganda points: they are realities of which we are all aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Government refused to take action last winter. They have relied totally on the fact that we are to have an annual review which will do something to offset the extraordinary rise in the cost of living since the previous Government. I do not intend to go over the ground we covered so extensively in our earlier debate, but it is relevant to remind the hon. Gentleman that the 20 per cent. increase of September, 1971, has already been more than swallowed up, and that, by the time of the next uprating in October, the cost of living will have risen by over 24 per cent. since the uprating of November, 1969.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the context of our proposal. We put it forward—and I know that this is in the mind of my hon. Friend—as a suggestion that it would do two things. First, it would be some form of compensation to the old-age pensioners for what we have denied them over these months when they have fallen behind; for the emergency payment which they did not get last winter; for the heating allowances they were denied and for the failure to give them an increase in the long-term addition then. Secondly, it would be some kind of insulation against the future increases in the cost of living which are looming ahead, still at a frightening rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that, as the hon. Lady has referred to 1969, she will also wish to remind the Committee that the purchasing power has fallen less in the eight months following the last uprating than it did after the 1969 uprating. The next uprating comes into operation in October, in a few months' time, whereas there was well over 12 months to wait in the case of the 1969 uprating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, Sir Stephen, we could start again the debate which we had on Schedule 1. None of us wants to do that if we are to make satisfactory progress today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's figures were
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>478</span>
challenged then—by me among others—on the basis that the real comparison ought to have been between what the Government are doing now when they are in an expansionist phase and what we did in 1965 and 1967 before the economic difficulties really piled on us. The comparison then is in our favour. If hon. Gentlemen would like me to do so, I will turn up the figures that I gave in the debate on Schedule 1. But I will resist that temptation, Sir Stephen. They are in the OFFICIAL REPORT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. Gentleman that what we are facing is a situation of physical actuality for the old. This retrospective payment, coming as a lump sum at the time of the uprating, would do something to meet the appalling threats of inflation that lie ahead, partly—in fact, very considerably—as a result of the decision which the Government hope to get in the House of Commons this evening to force us into membership of the European Economic Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give one quotation. This is from a report in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> on the recent report and forecasts of the National Institute:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The National Institute has estimated that the rise in the Consumer Price Index will accelerate next year to 7 per cent., which would be equivalent to a good 8 per cent. on the retail price index. It would not be unreasonable to bring forward this rate of increase to the period immediately ahead. The National Institute's projection is moreover based on a; rate of increase of earnings of about 10 per cent. per annum. This compares with 11½ per cent. for the latest available 12 months; and recent figures do not yet take into account the full implications of the coal and rail settlements, nor the rising level of economic activity. It would not be alarmist to project a rate of inflation running into double figures if nothing is done."</p></blockquote>
It is against that background that we make this proposition. We say to the hon. Gentleman that this lump sum, coming at the beginning of the winter months, would be a little bit in hand for the old. If he says to us that it is administratively unavoidable, that to make this retrospective payment at the time of the uprating would be to delay the uprating itself, I am sure that I would carry my hon. Friend with me in saying that we will not stand by the exact date. Our concern is the point of principle. In other words, if he prefers to make this retrospective lump sum pay-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>479</span>
ment a little after he has got the uprating into operation, we shall not object. It will still come in time to help the old people in the winter months of rising inflation that lie ahead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On each occasion on which I have risen this morning, Sir Stephen, you have given me some kind of sharp reminder. I listened to you on the last occasion, and I trust that I shall again be able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some ways, I am sorry that I have to move the Amendments, because I welcomed the attendance allowance when it was first suggested under the former Government and I welcome the extension proposed in the Bill. However, there my welcome ends, for it seems to me that to implement that extension in the four stages suggested in Schedule 4 means that we are deliberately deciding to leave the oldest members of the community until last. I find that completely unacceptable. It is offensive to every principle I have been brought up to believe in, and particularly to my sense of respect for the elderly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that there are bound to be difficulties in implementing the new extension of the attendance allowance. In our earlier debate the Under-Secretary told us that there were the 50,000 of working age, the 50,000 school children, the 40,000</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>480</span>
	<p>	<i>Question put</i>, That the Amendment be made:</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided</i>: Ayes 6, Noes 7.</p>
	<p>elderly and the 90,000 of the most elderly. It seems grotesque that we should leave the largest group until last.</p>
	<p>All the groups are in need of the attendance allowance, all are severely handicapped by ill-health, but I should like to point out with some force that the very elderly have the double handicap of old age itself together with that of the ill-health which entitles them to the allowance. We are saying to those 90,000 people, whose disabilities and ill-health are at least comparable to those suffered by any of the other groups, and who have the added burden of old age, that if they can wait until December, 1974, they will be eligible for payment. The truth, as we all know and must recognise, is that this group of the very old is the very group which cannot wait: these people do not have the time to wait. A large number of them will not then be here to receive the benefit of the extension of the attendance allowance.</p>
	<p>Since I entered the House in 1967, there have been many debates on various aspects of the provision for elderly people and I was struck by one remark of an hon. Gentleman whose name I shall not mention. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Jam tomorrow has a very small chance of appealing to those who are going to die tonight."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 7th February, 1969; Vol. 777, 	<i>c</i>. 740.]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>That is a very good saying because it illustrates what we are asking of the most elderly among the people who need the allowance.</p>
	<p>The Under-Secretary of State said quite fairly in a previous discussion that the choice which had to be made was an agonising one and we all have some sympathy with that, but why must we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0822">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>481</span>
deliberately choose the oldest of our people to wait more than two years, knowing that large numbers of them are likely to die before they receive a penny? To me, this seems inhuman. I suggest that we ought first to concentrate our efforts on speeding up the implementation of these provisions. I know that that is easier to say than to carry out, but we should make some special appeal to those involved in the extension of the attendance allowance to give all the help possible to bring about implementation in one stage instead of stretching it over two years.</p>
	<p>Are we placing sufficient reliance on the claimant's own general practitioner's report? If we are, it seems strange that there are so many cases which succeed on review. That is one point which should be looked at. Also, in order to speed up the implementation, can we not to a great degree use social workers? I have had cases in my constituency which succeeded on appeal but which no-one in his right senses should have rejected originally. I say "right senses" quite deliberately in relation to a case which I have particularly in mind.</p>
	<p>Could we not consider having no phasing at all? I know that it would cause difficulties, but might it not be more reasonable, rather than telling those old people that they are being put at the back of the queue, to say that the claims will be dealt with as they are made, perhaps on a first-come-first-served basis? That seems fairer than a deliberate decision to keep the most elderly to the very end of the waiting list.</p>
	<p>To come to the agonising choice to which the Under-Secretary referred, I have read his description on 4th July of the expert knowledge and advice given him by the chairman and members of the board, but I say that this must be largely a political choice. I have spoken to literally dozens of people from different walks of life and age groups, and I have deliberately asked them what, if there has to be a choice, that choice should be. I have not yet met one who has agreed that it is reasonable to keep the very old until last. If I had to make this agonising choice, I should say that, though no-one doubts or challenges the need of those who are of working age and of the school children, they at least have a better chance of surviving until December, 1974,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>482</span>
than have the most elderly people, whom we are leaving until last.</p>
	<p>I keep a file of attendance allowance cases. I have what I call my difficult cases—twelve cases of people who have been refused attendance allowance because they do not qualify under the existing law. They are cases which I believe to be most likely to succeed under the extension of the attendance allowance. This is no statistical cross-section: these are merely the cases which come to me. Five of these people are over 75 and two are over 65. There is one old lady of 90. I just do not know how I can tell her that we accept her need and are making provision to deal with it by extending the attendance allowance, and that, if she can hang on until she is 92, she will receive payment. No-one can say that is a reasonable way of treating these people.</p>
	<p>Mrs. M., 82 years of age, can hardly move at all now. All I can do is tell her to wait for two years and then she will receive this extended alllowance.</p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>Whatever advice is given, I believe that most ordinary people arc concerned with the care of the elderly, a care which was expressed time and lime again by members of the Opposition in the last Parliament when they were advocating the pensions for the over-eighties. If they were expressing that concern then they should do so now, and seek to reverse the phased implementation in the Bill.</p>
	<p>Amendments Nos. 72 and 73 are my own Amendments. If we divide on them, I hope that we shall not divide purely on party political lines. No-one can suggest that these Amendments are so earth-shattering that if they were carried the Government would fall. That event would merely cause them at least to think again on this issue, which is what I want them to do.</p>
	<p>I accept that the Amendments may be imperfect; all I did was to knock out "Four later days" and change it to "A day". But my intention was to delete the four phases of implementation and so cause the Under-Secretary at least to think again. He said that he had consulted DIG and other organisations, but I hope that he can indicate that he has consulted old-age pension organisations and those who specialise in dealing with the elderly members of our society—Age Concern and Care of the Aged.</p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>483</span>
	<p>Though extending the attendance allowance is a wonderful thing, I remain convinced that if we extend it in the phased manner suggested we shall be committing a tragic blunder, and the people who will suffer now are those who will not be here in 1974.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has made out a strong case for reversing the order. Whatever order is taken, the hon. Gentleman himself admitted that phasing is required. The only way in which we can get the extension into operation and to the people entitled to it as quickly as possible and in an orderly manner, is to have phasing. This is the advice that we received from the board with all its experience in this matter, and it is the advice which we have accepted. We are therefore faced with what I have described before as the agonising choice as to what the order should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that some of the elderly people will die before we are able to get the extension into operation. They will. But the harsh fact is that so will some of those of working age, the housewife; so will some of the mentally handicapped children. So the hon. Gentleman's argument applies to all groups, whatever order one takes. We have to decide, therefore, on the way in which they should be grouped and the order in which they should come. The only straightforward and easily understood way was to do it by age groups. It was on this that we sought the advice of the attendance allowance board, which now has a good deal of experience of the working of the allowance itself, and also has its own knowledge and experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want briefly to put some considerations to the Committee. Those disabled at working age tend to need long-term care and attention, and to that extent they represent a long-term burden and strain on those who look after them. In addition, among the younger disabled people are housewives who have either not been able to obtain, or have lost, their foothold in the national insurance scheme and are therefore not covered by a benefit in the national insurance scheme in the way in which elderly persons and children tend to be. That seemed to be a strong argument for taking those of working age first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, the experience of the attendance allowance board has confirmed the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>484</span>
prolonged financial and personal strain that care of a disabled child puts on parents, particularly the parents of mentally-handicapped children. This care often extends from childhood into adult life, and is thus also a long-term burden. Those are the main reasons for the order in which they were placed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether we would make a special effort, and a special appeal to everybody concerned, to get the extension into operation as fast as possible. Yes, indeed; we have done just that, and they are responding magnificently. I am sure that the Committee is full of praise for the work that the attendance allowance board has already done in getting well over 80,000 claims into payment, and the work that it is now doing to get the extension into operation. I assure the hon. Gentleman that everybody involved in this matter is fired by enthusiasm and dedication and recognises the need to do this job as fast as is humanly possible. For that reason we have retained some flexibility in the phasing of the groups, through the commencement order arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether we are placing sufficient reliance on the general practitioner who makes the initial report. The answer is that in the early days the attendance allowance boards and the general practitioners were unfamiliar, and had to build up their procedures and learn as they went. As a result, in the early days there was a substantial number of successful reviews. That is the advantage of the review procedure. But as doctors—and the delegated medical practitioners who decide whether the person is eligible—become more familiar with the arrangements, it should be possible for fewer reviews to take place, although it is difficult to be specific.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether social workers were being used to the maximum extent. The primary responsibility is on the general practitioner, and will remain so, but he is entirely free to use whatever local resources he thinks appropriate, and there is no doubt that there are cases now—particularly where the general practitioner has a close link with social workers and other people within his own practice—in which, if their specialist knowledge is more appropriate for helping to fill in the form, there is nothing to prevent that being done. Those are the main reasons for our
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0824">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>485</span>
making the agonising choice that we did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal briefly with two points referred to in our earlier debate, on which I was asked questions. The first concerns the question whether there is sufficient flexibility within the arrangements. That point was raised in connection with the discussion that we had on terminal illness. I have now considered this and I feel that there is sufficient flexibility in the administration and review procedure, but it would not be right to ask for regulation-making powers on questions concerning basic definition of the law relating to entitlement to the benefit itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also asked about publicity arrangements and I gave the assurance that the publicity material would be made available in the Library so that hon. and right hon. Members could see it. I was asked by the right hon. Lady if the letter that the Chairman of the Attendance Allowance Board will send to general practitioners could also be made available. I gave an assurance that I should discuss this with the Chairman because it is a matter for him, and I am glad to inform the Committee that he has no objection to that, so I shall see that that letter is made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Gentleman accepts that phasing is necessary. Equally, I hope that he will agree that everybody concerned with this allowance is determined to bring these 250,000 or so badly disabled people into benefit as quickly as is humanly possible. I hope that, on reflection, he will also feel that the advice of the attendance allowance board as to the order which the Government has accepted is appropriate in all the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the advice that the attendance allowance board gave, particularly in terms of which age group should have priority, is reflected in the Bill as it stands. The hon. Gentleman has made that clear. However, I think I am right in saying that the Attendance Board was driven to that conclusion on priorities because it was confronted with administrative facts which the Government put before it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Attendance Allowance Board was informed by the Department that it was not possible to implement this provision without phasing; that one had to decide which group was going to be dealt with first, and that it was only because it was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>486</span>
pushed into that situation that it—no doubt with great heart-searching and difficulty—gave that advice to the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in any way hiding behind the Attendance Allowance Board. The Government have to make these decisions, and we accept responsibility for that. However, we had to tell the board what the medical manpower position was. If we could have had more doctors available—if we could suddenly have summoned up doctors from here, there and everywhere—we could have told the board that more doctors were available and, consequently, it would not have been necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in the real world that simply was not the position. Therefore, the advice of the board was both as to the need for phasing and as to the order in which the groups should come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that. It was a policy determined by what the Government saw as the administrative requirements of the scheme. On the other hand, there is the other side of the dilemma, and that dilemma was admirably put by my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones) when he pointed out the tragic position of the old people who are expected to wait till last—old people who could well be dead, old people who will not be receiving their money until 1975–76.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When administrative difficulties cause an appalling human dilemma of this kind we have to be satisfied that everything possible has been done, or is being done, to overcome those difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are bound to ask the hon. Gentleman whether he is absolutely satisfied that no special procedures could be designed to deal specifically with this generation of very old disabled people who may well be entitled to attendance allowance. I do not want to push the hon. Gentleman at the moment, because I know the advice that he received. I also know that sometimes it is a very healthy thing—a very effective and useful thing—for the Minister to tell his Department that it must find a way round the problem; that procedure really must be speeded up, and that something must be done for the old people whose plight my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, West, has pointed out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>487</span>
My hon. Friends and I feel that we must do something for this older generation of people, who may be entitled to an attendance allowance before 1974, before 1975, and certainly before 1976. Therefore, realising all the hon. Gentleman's difficulties, I advise my hon. Friends to vote for Amendments Nos. 72 and 73 as an indication to the hon. Gentleman that no Opposition will ever be satisfied by purely administrative arguments. We must ask the hon. Gentleman to return to his Department—I hope that hon. Members on the Government benches will do the same—and try to find a way, even if it involves special procedures which they might not wish to operate in the long term, which would enable the benefits to be received by those people who, under the current arrangements, would receive them last</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Sir Stephen, for presiding over us in what has been a fairly long Committee stage for a Bill of this kind. We have been sitting for over 27½ hours, which is a record for an operating Bill of this kind. We are extremely grateful to you, Sir Stephen, to the staff, and to the Clerks of the House for the way in which they have assisted us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I equally thank the right hon. Lady and her team for the way in which they have assisted us. The hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) has the doubtful distinction of having made the longest speech in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It has been understanding, kindly, but firm. As model father of this Committee we thank you very much.

at the end of our proceedings on the Bill for the first time I have to rule the whole proceedings out of order, because there is no Question before the Committee. Therefore, the last two speeches have been completely out of order. They were very kindly meant, however, and I thank the hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Lady
