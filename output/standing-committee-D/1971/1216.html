and Amendment No. 167, in page 190, leave out lines 14 to 24.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing the principle of the Central Lancashire metropolitan county area, involving some of the country's most ancient towns and some of the country's most important industrial areas.<br><br>
A pattern is emerging as we listen to the Under-Secretary and the Minister telling us how they reach their conclusions on these matters. We have heard of the Under-Secretary travelling around in his helicopter, or some other form of air-transport, and travelling overland, too, holding conferences and coming to conclusions as to what the local government structure of boundaries should be in this area for the next 100 years.<br><br>
We all have a degree of affection for the Under-Secretary, although some of our exchanges might not have led you, Sir Stephen, to that conclusion. But even allowing for that, I cannot believe that in taking this decision on his own—I imagine with some support from his ministerial colleague who knows the area probably better than the Under-Secretary and I know it—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am suspect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear the Minister say that he is suspect. That is a confession to which we might well return on another occasion.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0278">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 501</span>
Nevertheless, allowing for any acknowledgements of the Under-Secretary's wisdom, I cannot believe that in him reposes all wisdom to such an extent that at one strike the hon. Gentleman can dissipate Burnley, Blackburn, Preston and Blackpool, not to mention Accrington Stanley—which is one of the most original and honourable footballing centres now, alas, relegated, even before the Bill, to a minor division of football authority.<br><br>
However, this is a serious matter. One would never have thought that any Government would have proposed a future pattern of local government which would, in respect of these important cities, have relegated them in the manner that they will be relegated. They will not even be district councils in the metropolitan area. The future boundaries of these areas will be determined at some future date by a Local Government Boundary Commission.<br><br>
These are no mean cities. Blackburn has a population of 272,000. Blackpool has a population of 293,000. Burnley has a population of 220,000. Preston has a population of 314,000. By any criteria these are four of the most important county boroughs in the country. It is worth saying in passing that, when one realises the attempts we are making to get through the Bill but also to spend a reasonable amount of time discussing the future status of the population of each of these cities, how difficult it is to do justice to their case when they are all lumped together in a debate of some two hours. That is an indication of the difficulties which all of us in this Committee face.<br><br>
There is a total population of 1 million in this area. Over 80 per cent. of the population live in urban authority areas. If ever there was a case for a unitary authority, which has been defeated, it is here in Lancashire. Therefore, we shall have to do the best we can for these authorities in the light of the defeat which our proposition sustained. We shall try to maintain the local government entity. I have visited in a ministerial capacity every one of these four towns. I have refereed football matches on their football grounds. If I did not mention Burnley, my friend Mr. Bob Lord, the Chairman of Burnley Football Club, would certainly be distressed today.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 502</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend never rigged the score, I take it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. I can give a categoric undertaking that in all the matches I have refereed conclusions were honestly arrived at without any prompting from the referee.<br><br>
Preston North End has won the F.A. Cup more time than any other club, with the exception of Aston Villa. I should also like to mention Blackpool and Blackburn Rovers.<br><br>
Some people outside this Committee might think it a little odd that this Committee on the future of local government should spend any time at all on football clubs. But there is nothing odd about it at all. I shall return later to what I hope has now come to be regarded in our considerations as the "Silkin four principles of community interest". One of the "Silken principles", which we shall be applying, is the principle of community interest. There is no better way of expressing the principle of community interest than through loyal and devoted support to a football club, a cricket club, or any other type of sporting club. It is no accident that these four clubs are hallowed throughout the country.<br><br>
I come now to the first point of analysis that I should like to make about the geographical neighbourhood. In the area which we are proposing as a metropolitan area, there are different types of neighbourhoods and communities. There is a great need in a large part of this conurbation for urban renewal, replacement of old houses and buildings of all descriptions, the replacement of industry, and the growth of new industry. Just to tie this in for the last time with the football clubs, it is historically interesting to note that the football clubs were the product of the Industrial Revolution. The emerging pattern of football clubs and sport in this country is very interesting. I do not want to bore you, Sir Stephen, but Southend has an honoured place in my affections. It is the ground on which I refereed my first football league match.<br><br>
The pattern of football club development in this country followed the emergence of the industrial pattern of the country. This is why in this area we have had the emergence, during the last 150 years, of these community interests of which, perhaps, the most important was the local football club.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0279">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 503</span>
This is the first area dealt with in the Amendment. There is a need for the replacement of industry, for the introduction of new industries to replace the old mills and running down industries, and a tremendous need for urban renewal. In our proposals for <i>Districts</i> (a) and (c) we recognise those geographical facts of life.<br><br>
Secondly, we have the new town emerging which is an essential and most powerful ingredient for Lancashire. I was very much involved during the last Parliament in the planning of this new town since I held ministerial responsibility for it. I know of the tremendous amount of thought that went into the designation of this new town and the attempt to determine the rôle of the new town in central Lancashire. We spent very many hours deciding where to draw the line between what should have been the new town boundary and a magnificent rural attachment which some people wanted to include in the new town.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Longridge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Longridge. I am obliged. We took the line that in order to solve the housing and industrial redevelopment problems of the neighbourhood, it would have been wrong to have included the whole area within the new town. This, of course, raises again—as I am sure Ministers have had to face—the question of how to dovetail the industrial and rural areas, the amenity neighbourhoods.<br><br>
The new town based on Preston, Chorley and that complex has a major job to do, a job of great significance. But it must be a rational conclusion. It ought not to be developing itself in isolation from the considerations of the remainder of the metropolitan area. When decisions are taken on the future of the central Lancashire town, regard should be had to the effect on the rest of the area. Divided responsibility without the provincial or regional councils can be a very dangerous concept, as far as the development of this area is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend not agree that during the last Administration Ministers thought this to be of such importance that they commissioned a special impact study to study the impact of the new town on the surrounding areas?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend for reminding me of the fact which I ought to have recalled immediately be-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 504</span>
cause it was—if one can claim any credit for one's colleagues in an Administration—a cardinal view of ours that no action should be taken which has tremendously repercussive effects upon other authorities, unless those effects are fully examined and those authorities given the fullest possible opportunity to state their case. It is not the least of our criticisms and objections to the way the Government are proceeding in rushing proposals through with almost indecent haste, without allowing other authorities to say what they think the effect will be on other populations of concentrating industry or housing in certain areas.<br><br>
To be able to talk about the new town areas for only three minutes when one has spent three years on the problem as a Minister highlights to the Committee the impossibility of confining oneself to a rational examination in a reasonable amount of time. It is virtually impossible. I remember the arguments we had when discussing the central Lancashire new town, the infrastructure and which way the road system should run, whether it should be vertical or horizontal. It took a long time to get the facts, draw the conclusions and reach a decision. Apart from the old areas of renewal, we have the new town which we designated in our Amendment as <i>District</i> (d).<br><br>
Then we have the entirely new facet of the neighbouring areas which we designate at <i>District</i> (<i>b</i>) and which will be better known to the Committee as Blackpool, St. Annes and Lytham. With great respect to your constituency. Sir Stephen, I am sure you will not mind my saying that Blackpool and St. Annes are the nation's most important playground. I think that is true. It has certainly been the opinion of Labour supporters. I am not quite sure, but I suppose hon. Members opposite might visit Southend or they might go a little farther north to Morecambe and Heysham.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot intervene in this debate as the hon. Gentleman well knows. He must also realise that hon. Gentlemen are responsible for the accuracy of their own statements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sir Stephen, in the 16 years I have spent in the House I cannot think that a more pertinent and penetrating observation has been made from the Chair. I will take note of what you have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0280">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 505</span>
said. I thought I was on your side by making an affectionate reference to Southend about five minutes earlier, but at any rate I am certain that it is at least one of the most important playground areas. That is of tremendous importance.<br><br>
One remembers with affection the holidays spent at Blackpool—particularly during the war when it was the only place in the country which one could visit to spend a holiday. It is a place I used to go to regularly. All politicians have associations with Blackpool because year by year great battles are fought there at the party conferences. We have come to know it and, whatever we may think of it, we have affection for it. The area of Lytham St. Annes, Blackpool and St. Annes-on-Sea not only enjoys the reputation of being one of the nation's greatest playgrounds but it also happens to be the North-West's best bedroom. Perhaps the two things to together. There is no doubt at all that as a dormitory area for the North-West the neighbourhood of the Fylde Peninsula is of great importance and represents entirely different considerations than do the old urban areas of Burnley, Preston, Blackburn and so on, and the new town area of central Lancashire. We have already identified, cheek by jowl, three entirely different geographical neighbourhoods, and there is a fourth which we designated as <i>District</i> (<i>e</i>) which involves the county town of Lancaster, and Morecambe and Heysham and their surrounding areas.<br><br>
Those of us who have visited that county town like the town and concede its importance in the North-West, and with Morecambe, and Heysham which is a port, we see that there are yet again different interests which must be safeguarded when considering the future.<br><br>
The problem is how these four different types of communities each having a distinctive role to play in the North-West, can be harmonised and how we can produce for them a coherent local government pattern and a coherent planning strategy.<br><br>
The main case for the central Lancashire metropolitan area in my judgment, rests on the planning. I do not believe that the planning interests of these conflicting types of area side by side, complementing each other, can be harmonised other than by one metropolitan authority, in the concept of the Bill.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 506</span>
I believe that the case for a metropolitan area here is overwhelming, because if we do not have it, it will be impossible to provide for renewal, development, preservation, or for conservation, all within the same geopraphical area, unless they are the responsibility of one authority, drawing its members from all the districts within that one authority. I think that the population pattern which, as I have said, is one million, also demonstrates this fact.<br><br>
I hope that some of my hon. Friends who know Lancashire better than I do will take up and develop this question, but one ought to spend time to discuss the effect that this will have upon Blackburn, Blackpool, Burnley and Preston if we take away from them the functions and powers which they now enjoy in respect of so many services. I think particularly of education, social services, and so on.<br><br>
We on this side of the Committee have our views as to where education should be placed, but we have to face up to the realities of power. One would have thought, with populations such as I have referred to for these towns, that with the Government's own criteria, Blackburn, Blackpool, Burnley and Preston were quite capable of running efficient education authorities. That they have done so forms a strong part of their case.<br><br>
I was Under-Secretary of State for Education for five years, and, with special reference to my responsibilities for the education of immigrants, handicapped children and other special education, I visited three out of these four towns—the three Lancashire towns—and I was greatly impressed by the care and devotion people on both sides of the political spectrum, and the great personal identification of the City Fathers, towards the services they were operating. I should have thought this was something to be cherished and not to be discarded lightly.<br><br>
This applies equally to the social services. As hon. Members know, the link between education, housing and the social services is a constant and recurring theme in the Committee, as it should be. Housing people, looking after their needs and servicing them in times of stress, which is the job of the social services, is best done locally by the district councils in a metropolitan area, particularly for the towns which I have mentioned.<br><br>
One could expand at great length on what I believe to be the overwhelming case for the designation of a metropolitan
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0281">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 507</span>
area for the bulk of Lancashire. Trying to state the case for one million people in the space of 20 minutes is a difficult task, and the brevity of my remarks does not in any way undermine the importance of many of the secondary points which ought to have been made.<br><br>
I have said enough, I believe, to justify the case, and we hope to hear from the Minister what extraordinary logic he is using if he maintains his proposals to reduce the importance and status of these four county boroughs. I hope, however, that the Minister will think again, and, having reflected upon the representations made by these authorities and the complexity of the Lancashire conurbation area, that even at this stage he will recognise the wisdom of the proposal in the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) has said, there is an overwhelming case for Lancashire to be treated as a metropolitan county and not as a non-metropolitan county.<br><br>
I draw the Minister's attention to similar counties; West Yorkshire is similar, although, as a Lancashire man, I think there is often a War of the Roses between Lancashire and Yorkshire. Nevertheless, West Yorkshire is a similar urban industrial area, and quite rightly, the Government have decided that that shall be a metropolitan area. South Yorkshire is again an urban industrial area, and the Government have properly decided that that too shall be a metropolitan county.<br><br>
When we come to Lancashire, which is on all fours with those counties, for some reason the Government have decided that this shall be a non-metropolitan county. My hon. Friend the Member for Small Heath has said that we are dealing here with over a million people. We are dealing essentially with a highly urban industrial environment, a similar environment to that in West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire. I cannot, therefore, see any reason why Lancashire is being treated as a non-metropolitan county.<br><br>
My hon. Friend has looked at the various areas in the County of Lancashire, and he stressed, rightly, that the essential matter so far as these boroughs are concerned is planning. Lancashire is a county where we are very worried about the decline of industry. We have cotton, coal any many other old industries. Most of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 508</span>
the towns referred to on the Amendment Paper are towns which, on their own initiative, sometimes without Government help, have—to use a phrase popular with hon. Gentlemen opposite—stood on their own two feet. They have attracted industry; they have tried to bring industry to Lancashire, to counteract the decline in the traditional industries of the area.<br><br>
Blackburn, for instance, was at one time wholly a cotton town. Cotton is no longer the staple industry of Blackburn. Engineering has overtaken cotton as a principal industry in this town. Blackburn, with its surrounding areas of Accrington and other urban districts mentioned in the Amendment, has a community of interest. Anyone from any of these districts would tend to say that they come from near Blackburn. They have tried to attract industry. They desperately need industry in the future, and they want to make their own planning decisions for the attraction of industry. This is a key factor for making Lancashire a metropolitan county—that each of these areas has the right to know what is best for it, as indeed they do, and to attract the particular kind of industry that a particular urban area requires.<br><br>
Secondly, there is Blackpool. We are fortunate here, in that every hon. Member in the Committee knows Blackpool. As my hon. Friend said, Blackpool is not only a great holiday centre, but a great conference centre, to which we go each alternate year. I make no comparison, Sir Stephen, between Blackpool and your delightful constituency, but it is a bigger holiday area, with larger halls for conferences. All the people of Blackpool, particularly the Conservative-controlled council of Blackpool, support this Amendment.<br><br>
Earlier on, the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Blaker) signed this Amendment as the Member for that constituency. During the Second Reading debate the hon. Member for Blackpool, North (Mr. Miscampbell) spoke on this subject.<br><br>
He pointed out the difference between a holiday area such as Blackpool and other types of urban areas. He dealt specifically with the question of parking facilities. Where there is a holiday area with seasonal traffic and cars coming into the area for several weeks of the year, particularly at weekends, there is an entirely different traffic problem from that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0282">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 509</span>
which exists in a non-holiday area. Blackpool knows how to cope with the problem. It has got to. It must know how to attract visitors and tourists. It knows how to cope with car parks and off-street parking.<br><br>
I very much doubt whether the county authority which for some strange reason in the Bill is responsible for car parking facilities would know what to do with a major holiday resort and seasonal traffic. Even if a car is causing an obstruction in a holiday resort, there is a great deal of leniency. There must be, otherwise if people were "booked" for parking offences they would not return. Huge car parks must be provided for holiday traffic. But under the Bill, that will be the responsibility not of Blackpool but of the county authority, which does not know how to deal with it.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
The other thing about Blackpool and Fleetwood, as the hon. Member for North Fylde (Mr. Clegg) pointed out, is that the area has also been a very serious unemployment problem. Fleetwood has one of the highest unemployment figures for the whole country. People like to go to Blackpool and Fleetwood to enjoy the sea air and beaches, but they forget that when the summer holiday season is over there is a shortage of jobs for the remaining nine months of the year.<br><br>
Previously I referred to Blackburn as requiring planning powers of its own. Similarly, this natural area of Blackpool, Fleetwood and the Fyldes also requires its own planning powers, but to attract a different kind of industry. The county authority cannot cater for both. It is better that each area deals with its own planning. All parties in Blackpool—the Conservative-controlled council in particular—desperately want to be a metropolitan borough so that they can control their own area as a holiday resort and also as an attractive area for industry. A county authority does not understand the type of problems that arise in areas such as this.<br><br>
The third area mentioned is Burnley which is similar in many respects to Blackburn. Being a Lancashire man, I appreciate that these are natural geographical areas. In the Amendment the town which centre on Blackburn or Burnley naturally coalesce together. Many hon. Members, not so familiar
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 510</span>
with the area, will not appreciate the point I am making, though I am sure the Minister of State, who represents a Lancashire constituency, will. Burnley is a cotton town which has become a major engineering town. It has many problems mainly concerned with the attraction of industry. It is an old town in need of urban renewal, which it is gradually achieving, and on its own initiative it is making itself an industrial centre in North-East Lancashire.<br><br>
All these Lancashire towns have an additional problem in that they will be on the geographical fringe of the Common Market and will therefore have a hard fight to attract industry and prevent it from going to the South East.<br><br>
My hon. Friend mentioned <i>District</i> (<i>d</i>), which is the county borough of Preston, which includes the new town of Chorley Leyland. In Lancashire, Preston is known as "Proud Preston"—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Invincibles, they used to be called.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Next year will be the year of the Preston Guild, and it is in that year that Preston loses its status as an independent town.<br><br>
The new town poses other problems also, different from those mentioned so far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could my hon. Friend develop one point more fully? Those of us who come from Lancashire appreciate the significance of what he has said about the Preston Guild as part of the history of that distinguished borough. However, many hon. Members are not so well informed. Would he, therefore, say a little more on that particular subject?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the name implies, the Preston Guild was established in mediaeval times and is held every 20 years. A favourite saying in Lancashire, if we do not see anyone for a long time, or something is done only rarely, is, "once every Preston Guild".<br><br>
The Preston Guild year is an important event in Lancashire and it is in that year that proud, ancient Preston becomes a district and ceases to be the Preston which we in Lancashire have always known.<br><br>
Apart from Preston, there is also the new town of Chorley Leyland, and the problems within that new town will be quite different from those in other areas
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0283">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 511</span>
to which I have referred. When a major new town is being established, and it is to be the biggest new town in the whole country, it is essential that the district concerned has all-purpose power with regard to that new town. Those powers should not be given to the county council which deals with so many other things.<br><br>
That area, blending the old Preston with the new Chorley Leyland, again a perfectly natural area, is to be created into a metropolitan district as distinct from a non-metropolitan district with major powers reserved to the county council.<br><br>
<i>District</i> (<i>e</i>) is less of an urban area than the other areas which I have mentioned, with the boroughs of Lancaster, Morecambe and Heysham, the urban district of Carnforth and the rural district of Lunesdale. At first sight, it might appear to be logical for this area which has an affinity with the new Cumbria, not to be in the new county of Lancashire at all but to go over the border to the new county of Cumbria. One is then faced with the ridiculous position of having the town of Lancaster in a different county from Lancashire. I concede that the area is less in population than the other areas which I have mentioned. It is nevertheless very important. Lancaster is a university town; it has a very important university. The whole area is a growth area. Its problems are different from those of other areas which have been mentioned.<br><br>
There is an overwhelming case in favour of each district having, not all-purpose powers, but the most-purpose powers that metropolitan districts, as distinct from non-metropolitan districts, will possess.<br><br>
I shall be interested to hear either the Under-Secretary or the Minister of State explain to the Committee how a case can be made for saying that what is right for West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire as industrial urban areas is somehow wrong for an exactly similar urban area of Lancashire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment, which seeks to turn the ordinary County of Lancashire into a metropolitan county, is important, for the reasons already adduced by my hon. Friends. One of the most important differences between the County of Lancashire and all other non-metropolitan counties is that it already
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 512</span>
contains four county boroughs. Of all the non-metropolitan counties listed in the Schedule, 10 do not contain even one county borough, 17 contain one county borough, while eight contain two county boroughs. Devon and Sussex—whose position is slightly different, in that they are on the south coast and include coastal resorts—each have three county boroughs. Not surprisingly, therefore, the county boroughs of Lancashire wish to know why they have been treated differently from other parts of the country—from West Yorkshire, for example, which was the example cited by my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes).<br><br>
Eighty-three per cent. of the population of this part of the country live in urban areas, while only 17 per cent. live in rural areas. The area is, therefore, ripe for metropolitan status. Indeed, the Redcliffe-Maud Committee, while it did not designate the area as a metropolitan county, agreed that it was the strongest candidate for such status among those areas not so designated. The committee was to some extent constrained since, at the stage when it was preparing its Report, no decision had been taken about the central Lancashire new town. I suspect that if a firm decision about the new town had been taken before Redcliffe-Maud reported the committee would have recommended that this area should be designated a metropolitan district at the outset of local government reform. As it was, the committee made it clear that this area should be reviewed once the new town was under way.<br><br>
My hon. Friends and I would argue that it would be far more satisfactory, having regard to the pattern of services which have been built up in the county borough areas, to adopt, at the outset, metropolitan county status and metropolitan districts along the lines laid down in the Amendment.<br><br>
I should like to refer to the Preston district which we have defined, which goes slightly wider than the area which my hon. Friend eventually drew around the central Lancashire new town. It is worth remembering that the central Lancashire new town comprises only Chorley and Leyland, but includes the whole of the county borough area of Preston. Indeed, the bulk of the population in the district, including Preston, will be covered by Central Lancashire new town. Unfortunately, the map which has been prepared
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0284">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 513</span>
—I was polite about the maps on an earlier occasion—is not very helpful, since it does not show the designated area for the new town.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Michael Heseltine)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The maps which I have, which I hope are copies of those available to the Committee, clearly show that designation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a small problem here. I have two maps which clearly show the central Lancashire new town.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I do not have that map.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps we can leave this for the moment. The Under-Secretary may possibly be able to clarify the situation a little later.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may explain that on the map which I have seen there is an arrow which points to Chorley Municipal Borough and reads "Central Lancashire New Town Boundary", whereas the central Lancashire new town comprises much more than the Municipal Borough of Chorley, namely, the whole of the Leyland Urban District Council, the Walton-le-Dale Urban District Council, certain parishes in the Chorley Rural District, Preston County Borough, Fulwood Urban District, and certain areas in Preston Rural District. I hope that the Under-Secretary may be able to provide us with adequate maps before we conclude our debate on the Clause.<br><br>
The new town has been agreed upon, after considerable and protracted debate, in order to provide an engine for the industrial transformation of Lancashire. When that new town was being considered by the Labour Administration it was considered not as an end in itself, but in the context of the whole of North Lancashire. My right hon. Friends commissioned the same consulting planners, Robert Mathew Johnson Marshall to prepare a plan.<br><br>
I have now been handed a copy of the map to which the Under-Secretary referred a few moments ago. It illustrates the position much more clearly, and makes the point which I referred to earlier, namely that the great bulk of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 514</span>
population in Metropolitan <i>District</i> (d) falls within the area of the central Lancashire new town. The excluded areas in <i>District</i> (d) are rural areas which contain a very small proportion of the total population.<br><br>
When considering the central Lancashire new town my hon. Friends realised its importance, not merely for the communities in that area but also for those in the remaining parts of North Lancashire. As my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes said, North-East Lancashire, the areas in the southern part of Metropolitan <i>District</i> (a) surrounding Blackburn, and the areas of the Burnley County Borough and Nelson and Colne Municipal Borough have gone through a difficult period in recent years. Nothing would have been worse than to have set up a new town in central Lancashire which would have had a further harmful effect upon those areas, and my hon. Friends made it clear that they wished to ensure a harmonious development for the different parts of North Lancashire.<br><br>
Among the individual county boroughs with which we are dealing are those which have pioneered a great deal of important work. Those who have served as Ministers at the Department of the Environment, or at the Departments which preceded it, know how assiduous the County Boroughs of Blackburn and Burnley are in pressing their case. Whether for additional funds for a certain project, or for the new line of a road, they have proved to be formidable pressure groups in putting their views to successive Governments.<br><br>
But those authorities have been more than formidable pressure groups. In the post-war period they have attempted to tackle some of the most difficult urban problems in the country, in an area suffering from bad housing, combined with the problem of declining industry. It was their ambition to transform those areas into areas which were not only pleasant to live in but which had an economic and industrial future, and I suggest that they have carried out that task to the very best of their ability, given the policies of successive Governments.<br><br>
I cite in particular the experiments carried out in the Blackburn County Borough area, which is the area I know best, in part through family links. In education, and in the transformation of borough's central area, I think that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0285">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 515</span>
work done by Sir George Eddie and, more recently, by Alderman Mottershead is outstanding in local government service.<br><br>
I have no wish to take the Committee away from local government reorganisation, but those authorities which have had experience in transforming their areas are to be divided, and transformed, as a result of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) put his finger on the problem when he said that the trio of services, educational, personal social and housing, must work together as a team if there is to be satisfactory and adequate urban renewal in these areas. The experience of these county boroughs over the last 20 years has shown that they are useful authorities. For Blackpool, Burnley and Preston, the appropriate solution would be to maintain their position as metropolitan districts. There is an advantage in that. Whereas in the past, as county boroughs, they have been hemmed in by their boundaries, they would now be able to operate over the wider areas of the districts suggested in my hon. Friend's Amendment.<br><br>
My hon. Friends have referred also to the problems of Blackpool, Fleetwood, Lytham St. Annes and Thornton Cleveleys. Coastal reports have their own problems; and problems are posed by the Bill. Several of my hon. Friends—and the hon. Member for Blackpool, North (Mr. Miscampbell) on Second Reading—have referred to car parking. Blackpool County Borough carries on a variety of activities, some of them unusual for a county borough, such as the Blackpool airport. What future has that airport under a county structure? Coastal resorts often find airports a useful part of their service. Will Blackpool, as a county district, be able to maintain the airport which has been important to Blackpool, and to the whole of the North-West, in the past?<br><br>
Coming on to <i>District</i> (<i>e</i>), Morecambe and Lancaster—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious that my hon. Friend should not conclude his fascinating speech without some reference to Amendment No. 165 to which he has put his name.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend and I wish to hear his argument so that we can give the Amendment our full consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Small Heath has referred to Amendment No. 165, and I shall come
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 516</span>
to it later. Possibly my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), the principal signatory will return in due course, and when he comes to speak later in the debate, he will deal with it at greater length.<br><br>
However, I have not finished my comments on <i>District</i> (<i>e</i>), an area about which there is some concern, and which I believe to be one of the potential growth areas. The University of Lancaster, under the distinguished leadership of Charles Carter, its Vice-Chancellor, has a project for turning Lancaster and the area around it into an area rather like that round Boston in the United States. A large number of small, high technology, science-based industries working in the immediate area could be closely linked with the university. There has been close liaison at all times between the University of Lancaster and the City of Lancaster, to encourage firms which would be able to use the services of the university to come into Lancaster, and to develop new science-based industries. Around Boston, Massachusetts, linked to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, there is a highway—Highway 201, if I recall aright—along which are to be found a large number of these small, science-based firms, working closely with the M.I.T. whose professors often act as consultants.<br><br>
The Vice-Chancellor of Lancaster University has a clear idea that something similar could happen in North Lancashire, around Lancaster and Morecambe, and he has already taken steps to put it in hand. With the communications now available—the M6 runs through Lancaster, and there is the possibility of a Calder Valley motorway to link North Lancashire with the East Coast, and with the European markets—the possibility of a new scientific growth area around the University of Lancaster is a serious starter, and would transform the character of Metropolitan <i>District</i> (<i>e</i>).<br><br>
Now, a word on Amendment No. 165, which is a tidying-up Amendment. Ormskirk, Litherland and parts of the Rural District of West Lancashire do not altogether fall into this Metropolitan County of Lancashire and would not otherwise be included in any county if the Amendment were carried. My hon. Friends the Members for Widnes and for Wigan (Mr. Fitch) and I have put down an Amendment to put them into the Merseyside Metropolitan Area, so that no part of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0286">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 517</span>
county should fall outside the boundaries of any county, metropolitan or otherwise.<br><br>
Another minor piece of tidying up will need to be done on Report if this is carried. When we tabled Amendment No. 165, we assumed that the Amendments dealing with Turton and Ramsbottom would be excluded; and if this is carried, half of the Urban District of Turton and half of the Urban District of Ramsbottom, which we discussed earlier this week, and which are not in the Greater Manchester area or in the Metropolitan County of Lancashire would be floating—I would not say between the devil and the deep blue sea, but between two authorities. A further Amendment will need to be introduced on Report to clarify their situation. Amendment No. 165 tidies up the southern boundary of the metropolitan county.<br><br>
When the Minister disappointed us on Tuesday on those Amendments, he said that if we waited patiently, our turn would surely come, and we should hear good news. I am pleased to note that the smile has returned to the Minister's face. Perhaps today we shall hear that good news, and he will be able to tell us that the Government have agreed to accept the Amendment, to provide a proper form of government, ensuring that this key area of Lancashire will be a metropolitan county.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Lamond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not take up much of the time of the Committee. My hon. Friends have deployed a strong argument for this series of Amendments. We have been told that the local authorities now operating in these county boroughs are much in favour of our proposals. That is easily understood. My own constituency, Oldham, East lies within the County Borough of Oldham. I have had the opportunity of discussing with the people serving on that local authority how they would feel about becoming <i>District</i> (f) in Manchester metropolitan county. They told me that, in the main, they are happy about the prospect. They feel almost satisfied with the services which will be left for them to provide, and the status which will remain for Oldham. This will be very fairly extended to include considerable parts of Yorkshire, enabling them to have a buoyant rateable value with which to renew the urban centre of Oldham.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 518</span>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that we cannot just discuss Oldham, except in a reference to its attitude as contrasted with somebody else's attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Sir Stephen. That was the point I was trying to make. What my hon. Friends have been saying really amounts to this. There are great differences within the proposed Lancashire county. They have given examples of the differences between Blackpool and Blackburn. No one who has visited these county boroughs will doubt that there are considerable differences between the two. The people from that area, and Oldham, and all the cotton towns of Lancashire, used to go to Blackpool for their holidays. Many of them still do. Obviously, they went there for a change. One does not go to an area similar to one's own for one's holidays.<br><br>
Not many people would go from Oldham to Blackburn for their holidays. Not many people, I am sorry to say, come to Oldham for their holidays. It is an interesting place, if one is interested in the history of the Industrial Revolution. However, I think that most people would prefer ot go to places like Blackpool.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend is quite wrong. Judging by the very sparse attendance on the other side of the Committee—we are keeping the Government's quorum again—I should think that many hon. Members opposite are now visiting Oldham.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that my right hon. Friend made that intervention. The last time he intervened in a speech of mine, it was to draw attention to the fact that, because I was speaking, the attendance had grown considerably. I made sure that a copy of the OFFICIAL REPORT for that occasion was well circulated. Unfortunately, my hon. Friend has now made it impossible for me to circulate a copy of today's proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Marcus Fox</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My twin sister went to Oldham to find a husband.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure you will agree, Sir Stephen, that we cannot discuss that.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0287">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 519</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member gives way again, I repeat that I have already ruled that we cannot discuss Oldham under this Amendment, whether it has to do with matrimonial problems or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure you will allow me to observe, Sir Stephen, that at least one of my colleagues who is absent is a bachelor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am struggling as you are, Sir Stephen, to get away from the subject of Oldham. I think I have said enough damaging things about my constituency already. I shall now deal with Blackpool. I am sure I should be out of order in bringing Aberdeen into this, but it has a certain affinity with Blackpool in that it is a large holiday resort. It is the largest in Scotland. I am aware of the problems, having been a chairman of the finance committee—a key position in a local authority—and of the demands which are made when an area is primarily a holiday resort. There is no area in Britain which is thought of more as a holiday resort than Blackpool. The question of the services to be provided hinge largely on the financial arrangements which are to be made, at some time in the future, about local authorities.<br><br>
We have all read the Green Paper, which appeared to indicate that the arrangements, at present found so unsatisfactory by many local authorities, are to continue. The Government do not appear to be changing the present arrangements very much.<br><br>
One can understand that a local authority with a certain amount of freedom, such as Blackpool would have if it were a metropolitan district, would wish to spend its money in a different way from a metropolitan district such as Blackburn. The objects of their expenditure would be different. We have heard about car parking already. Speaking from my experience in a local authority in a resort area, I know the importance of ample car parking. It is needed to attract the holidaymakers who come for a few days, not for a fortnight. People who used to come by train for a fortnight or a week at Blackpool now come for a few days by car, and they all want parking space. They will avoid areas where
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 520</span>
they cannot get easy, inexpensive parking. Therefore, the Blackpool authority, whatever it will be, will have to provide that car parking facility for its visitors if it is to continue to survive.<br><br>
I am sure that a local authority which is deriving its finances from the ratepayers in Blackpool would be quite prepared to do that, because the advantage will be felt by the ratepayers themselves. There are streets and streets of small boarding houses in Blackpool. I am sure that the people running those boarding houses will not object to paying rates when they know that they will get a return. However, if the rates to be spent are raised in Blackburn for this purpose, the people there might object to it being spent in this way.<br><br>
What have the Government in mind regarding local authority finance? Will Blackpool be able to continue with its illuminations, which are initially very expensive but which are, obviously, of tremendous benefit in extending the holiday season? They draw many people to Blackpool, which is of consequential advantage to the people who pay the rates.<br><br>
Will the local authorities, as proposed by the Government, have sufficient freedom to meet the local needs which they know best? My thinking, which is borne out by the acceptance of the proposals for Oldham, which are in line with the proposals we are making in respect of Lancashire, is that they would be much better served if these areas were metropolitan districts, with the greater freedom which goes with that status.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to speak unnecessarily. If the Minister indicates that he will accept these Amendments I will not make any further contributions to the discussion. Since he looks blank, I assume that he does not intend to accept. I will therefore add my few words to the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the hon. Member will wish me to listen to his speech before finally making up my mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping that my speech would be unnecessary, but I am delighted to know that the Minister is keeping an open mind.<br><br>
It is a pity that, once again, we need to complain about the maps. After the comments made last Tuesday I had hoped that we would have had made available
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0288">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 521</span>
the Ordnance Survey maps showing us the geography for this area. That is important in relation to the Amendments.<br><br>
I speak with some slight personal knowledge of Lancashire because as I mentioned on a previous occasion, my wife's family lived and farmed in all parts of the county. I have travelled the length and breadth of Lancashire from Nether Kellet near Carnforth, and the Trough of Bowland, as well as having visited Lancashire towns south of the area we are talking about. The Government are mistaken in putting together the northern and hill areas of Lancashire with the southern county boroughs of Lancashire.<br><br>
I shall be surprised if the Minister refuses to give the remaining parts of Lancashire metropolitan county status. Knowing Lancashire as I do, I think that he is asking for trouble if he gives metropolitan county status to part of Yorkshire and not to Lancashire. To give metropolitan county status with metropolitan district councils for part of Lancashire—towns such as Oldham—and deny towns like Blackpool and Blackburn the same status is asking for trouble.<br><br>
In my experience of Lancashire, there is a tremendous individuality in these towns and unless one has visited the county one cannot appreciate it. When I first visited Lancashire I thought it was all town. It was not true. I was particularly impressed with the individuality of the towns, and the almost fierce local pride which exists between Oldham, Blackburn, Rochdale and other towns, some of which will become metropolitan districts and some will not.<br><br>
From a geographical point of view—much more so even than Hampshire—this proposal is wrong. It has the southern end of the County of Lancashire with a tremendously large population, and not very far north the growth point of a new town, with a big rural area to the north and east. It is true that communications have improved tremendously in the ten years with the opening of the M6 motorway along the north-south axis. Nevertheless there are differences between the people of the area of Lunesdale rural district and the people of the southern part of the county. When we discussed the Amendment regarding culture the Minister made the point about uniting town and country and when I consider why the Minister may refuse to accept this Amend-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 522</span>
ment I expect that he may very well adduce the same sort of argument. If he does, he will be making another mistake, because these Amendments unite town and country but, as I said on Hampshire, at a reasonable level.<br><br>
They put together the rural area from the Bowland rural district that looks towards Blackburn, and that seems sensible, but they do not join the area of Lunesdale rural district and the Lancaster rural district with the towns at the southern end—Nelson, Colne, Blackburn and, on the coast, Blackpool. These towns have different characters and I appeal to the Minister to think about this because, living as I have in the south-west, I agree that there are differences of character between towns in Devon. There are lots of differences between the towns in North Devon and Torbay in the south. Nevertheless I would not say that that should mean a metropolitan county with separate metropolitan districts. What about Plymouth? In the rest of the County of Devon there are differences, but they are not so great as to justify a metropolitan county.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I should like to make a point about the new town in central Lancashire. I have some experience of new towns—there is one in my constituency; the town of Redditch. Based on that experience, I think it highly desirable that there should be, at a lower level, this giant County of Lancashire which is a planning authority, an authority to deal particularly with education and all the personal problems that arise out of a new town. There is a need for a metropolitan district based on Preston which will cover that new town.<br><br>
I must take the Minister back to a previous discussion that we had on Hampshire and to the question of what people want. When we discussed Hampshire he said that he was impressed more by the elected representatives—perhaps I am doing him an injustice—than by a desire to assess the feelings amongst the community. He said he had a conflict between elected representatives in North Hampshire and those of Southampton and Portsmouth.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will tell us what elected representatives of the northern part of the county of Lancashire feel because, from what we have heard today, the elected representatives from the south-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0289">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 523</span>
ern part of Lancashire and the representatives here and the representatives of the towns themselves want a metropolitan county. To my mind, the most important point in redrawing a map of local government is providing what people want. Just the other day he said that I was being sensible when I said that we did not want to be too dogmatic about reorganisation of local government. If I wish to be dogmatic about anything it is this: local government units that people want should be the overriding consideration. The evidence has been that the people of Lancashire want a metropolitan county. If the Minister can convince me otherwise I will revise my opinion. He has said that he is keeping an open mind, and I will do the same. I impress upon him to bear in mind the geography, the character of the towns, the need for a lower, more immediate unit of local government. That is what the people of Lancashire want.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I inform Members that the revised maps have arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ray Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to admit at the outset that my links with Lancashire are somewhat tenuous. I regret that. What I have heard so far in this debate has helped me considerably in understanding the problems of that part of our island.<br><br>
I know a little more about the area of Lancashire under question. I have attended a number of Labour Party Conferences there and I must say that it offers a very pleasant change from the atmosphere at Brighton. Pleasant as Brighton is, when one goes to Blackpool one encounters an entirely different spirit. I would say it is more English; that Brighton is a more cosmopolitan place, almost Continental. Blackpool is an adequate reflection of what life is like in that area; I mention fish and chips—one encounters fish and chips at Brighton, of course, but never of the same quality as in Blackpool.<br><br>
I have another social link with this area. I have supported the Burnley Football Club for some 25 years. That might not be thought an appropriate point to raise in this debate, but following the Burnley Football Club has enabled me to get to know rather more about that area than I should ever have done otherwise. It is sad to reflect that Burnley, like many other clubs in that particular part of the world, is in the Second Division now. It reflects the sad decline of the area in recent years.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 524</span>
There is one final link, and this is important. I have recently played the hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) at squash. During the game we discussed the Bill—in fact, almost every point was punctuated with some reference to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. Member will not reverse the procedure now, by ignoring the Local Government Bill and talking about squash.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure you, Sir Stephen, that the points we discussed during the game were more important than the game itself, because we covered almost every aspect of local government activity; the social, cultural and economic life of that part of Britain. I therefore come to the Committee today rather better briefed than I should have been had I not played that game. Indeed, playing a number of games with the hon. Member for Accrington has enlightened me no end.<br><br>
I know, for example, that that particular part of our island has a unique social character. It would be a sad thing if we split up and tore apart what is a unique part of our island. When we consider local government, the first thing we should do, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) has said, is to keep together those communities which have existed over the centuries and upon whose community spirit we can draw in order to tackle the pressing problems that we have before us.<br><br>
We have not dismissed the provincial argument, but have passed it—it is not a feature of our present discussion. But I think that it is essential in local government reform that the top tier should be based, as nearly as possible, on the wider social, cultural and economic arguments.<br><br>
The area of Britain now under discussion was formerly a great industrial centre. It has had industry, apart from the Midlands, for longer than any other part of the world. As an industrial centre it has formed a social and cultural life which is unique to the area. Unfortunately, with the decline of the textile industry, with modernisation and new techniques, there has been a tremendous amount of change in that area. After coal mining, no industry has undergone more rapid change than textiles. It is a sad comment on national Government that they have not catered in a more human way for the needs of the people in that industry.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that the number of mills in Lancashire has fallen from 300 to fewer than 30 in recent years; and that the total labour force has fallen from 750,000 to less than 100,000 in the last 70 years?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that information. It is a sad tale, and I cannot see the situation in the immediate future getting any better, certainly not under this Government. With the withering fire of competition being directed at every segment of the economy, industries like textiles can only fare worse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One does not wish to be unfair to the present Government, and their recent announcement of their decision to run quotas together with tariffs has brought a breathing space to the industry. One must give credit where it is due, but there is still a great deal to be done before the industry is properly protected and assisted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that they are doing something. But what about this controversy about which I have read recently, of the Government withdrawing the foreign registration marks—the need for all imported goods to bear an imprint of the country of origin? I should have thought that that would have a depressing effect on the whole of the textile industry in Lancashire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly so, and in a debate this week on the winding-up of the Textile Council, I drew attention to a Private Member's Bill which I am bringing forward. That Bill would properly protect not only the textile industry but many other of our industries. It is supported by these industries. I also drew attention to another Bill, which is being presented by the hon. Member for Leicester, South-West (Mr. Tom Boardman) which also deserves support, but which is narrower than my Bill in its application.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Laurance Reed</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member aware that the contraction of the textile industry was forecast long before the present Government came to power, and that the present contraction is exactly on schedule—as forecast? Is he further aware, remembering the hon. Gentlemen's interest in development areas, that in Bolton only 15 years ago we had 37,000 people employed in textiles? We now have less than 11,000, and yet we have overcome
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 526</span>
the difficulties caused by this contraction, and taken on new industries without all the whining and bleating that comes out of development areas? In other words, we have done it by standing on our own feet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should love to hear the hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed) addressing a crowd of unemployed workers in Lancashire, and coming across with that particular line.</span></p>
<p>[Mr. ARTHUR JONES <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend not think that the intervention by the hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed) contrasts rather strangely with the recent formation of the textile industry support campaign which has been seeking both inside and outside the House to get the Government to do something about the rapidly accelerating decline in the textile industry, which is not on schedule, as the hon. Gentleman put it? On schedule towards destruction, I presume he means. The contraction is, in fact, much further ahead than was forecast, and that is why his own Government have taken action by changing their mind about quotas. If they thought that the industry was capable of continuing without quotas, they would not have retained or introduced them.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend will allow me, before he replies to that point, to come back to the question raised about the area of Burnley, which is affected by the Amendment.<br><br>
It is not only the question of the quantitative rundown of the textile industry which is so important, and which gives so much concern to people in the Burnley area, but also the qualitative rundown. Mills such as Spencers in Burnley are closing—mills which are the most modern and well-equipped in the industry. Unfortunately, it is just those mills which have invested in new equipment which are unable to keep going, whereas others which are using equipment which ought to be in a museum—and in fact is very similar to equipment in textile machinery museums—are able to keep going, since they have written off their capital costs. Thus a much more serious situation is developing as a result of the present Government's policies.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 527</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are a little wide of the subject. Perhaps the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) will bring the debate back to the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One reason why I embarked upon the economic difficulties of the area is that to a large extent economics lie at the centre of these matters. I am sorry we were drawn as wide as we were by the hon. Member for Bolton, East. Nevertheless, I feel I must reply to the point which he made.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the rundown of the textile industry, and to the fact that it was known many years ago that it would decline. That is quite true. Indeed, the first Government which gave aid and sustenance to the textile industry was a Conservative Government. The precise situation was known well before the war. I do not wish to single out the Conservative Party, when in office, as bearing full responsibility for the sad problems existing today. A study of the situation over the past 40 years would probably reveal that all Governments share equally that responsibility, not only with regard to textiles, but to every other basic industry which sustained the British economy for 150 years. However, textiles is an almost unique example of that process.</span></p>
<p>[Sir STEPHEN MCADDEN <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Reed</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member agree that it is important to distinguish between "decline" and "streamlining"? In a sense, the textile industry is declining in that the number of people employed therein is contracting the whole time—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member will not be diverted into a discussion on the economic history of this country, or its future prospects. We must return to discussion of the Amendment. Mr. Carter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I became pre-occupied with that point as a result of the interventions of my hon. Friends who come from that area, and who naturally see the decline of the textile industry as being at the heart of most of the area's problems.<br><br>
I referred earlier to the needs of communities which are long established, with a long history of association and with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 528</span>
cultural affinities. I believe that in considering the question of the reform of local government we should use those affinities and associations rather than split them apart. Given that this area has been connected for 200 years or more with the textile industry, I believe that in bringing about change in the area we should rely upon the human resources developed over a long period in order to carry this community through the difficult period ahead.<br><br>
I want to refer to the Department of the Environment Circular "Reorganisation of Water and Sewage Services: Government Proposals and Arrangements for Consulation". Paragraph 44 states that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government … also consider it desirable that the control over pollution in major estuaries should wherever practicable be unified in the hands of a single authority."</p></blockquote>
The River Ribble runs through the heart of this area which is suggested as a new unit of local government. One would have hoped, with respect to rivers throughout the country, there would have been a single local authority responsible for the problems associated with water-ways. There is a great demand at present not only for increased amenities but for amenities of high quality. There are docks on the River Ribble, which naturally create pollution problems. Thus I should have thought that the form of local government organisation and boundaries suggested in the Amendment would be most suitable, bearing in mind the Circular's recommendation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Reed</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman not heard the Government's proposals for the reorganisation of water supplies? Does he not agree that in considering these new authorities, the parameters concerned must be environmental, not political?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately one cannot separate the two. After all, politics are about people. Local government is about people. Inevitably, when considering the most efficient and economic way of utilising the various resources and forming them into adequate units of local government, politics Will start to impinge upon such questions as environmental control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has said that politics is about people. It is also about the accountability of politicians to people, and the democratic control of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0292">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 529</span>
services. The proposals in respect of the water authorities confirm our worst fears as to the democratic content and future of our major services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question of the environment is extremely important. It is sad that it has, to some extent, been neglected in the Bill. Let us consider, for example, the question of rivers which form natural boundaries. I should not have thought it in the best interests of environmental control and improvement that one authority on one side of a river should be in charge of environmental questions while another authority, on the opposite side, does precisely the same job. Unfortunately, local authorities often experience difficulty in getting on with one another. One would have hoped, in the case of this particular area, that one authority, surrounding the estuary should, as the White Paper recommends, have been made responsible for environmental questions.<br><br>
I refer to the very close affinity of interest that exists between an area like Birmingham, which I represent, and an area like Lancashire. These two are the oldest centres of industrial activity in the world. When we discuss the West Midlands I shall press this point; I should have hoped that we would use the cultural, economic and social standards, affinities and so on, that have been a part of those communities for two hundred years or more, in order to carry us through the great period of change that now faces us as a nation. I hope that the Minister will not dismiss the Amendment out of hand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly torn in the temptation that I have to welcome back to the Committee the hon. Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter). I am torn in one direction overwhelmingly with pleasure at seeing him back, but terrified that he might feel it necessary to intervene in the debate. If he will accept my welcome in silence, I will give it with even greater conviction.<br><br>
We started this long discussion on the subject of creating a metropolitan area in Lancashire with various points raised by the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes). He dealt in detail with a number of the cases that have been put forward, in particular relating to Blackpool.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 530</span>
I understand the strength of the feeling behind the arguments, because I have heard from my hon. Friends the Members for Blackpool, North (Mr. Miscampbell) and Blackpool, South (Mr. Blaker) of the anxieties that are felt locally. I have visited Blackpool and discussed them with people there, and I am familiar with the arguments, specifically as they relate to Blackpool and generally as they relate to the coastal resorts.<br><br>
There certainly was anxiety. When we come to the allocation of functions at a later stage of the Bill it will be seen that we have tried to help wherever possible. I will refer briefly to one or two of the anxieties. First, there is the question of the Illuminations, and matters of that sort. There is no proposal to affect the present exercising function of the Illuminations. Under the Bill, the Illuminations will be in the hands of the proposed districts and the districts could not conceivably be drawn without Blackpool itself being a district.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Widnes specifically dealt with car parking. That is one of the sectors it has always been felt fitted in to the transportation planning of the area: it is not possible to create car parking, with the effect that it can have on roads, without linking it with the planning and building of the roads themselves. The Amendment would have the same effect as the proposals as drawn in the Bill. The car parking provisions are at metropolitan county level and not at metropolitan district level, so the Amendment would not help in dealing with that situation.<br><br>
Another question raised dealt with the attraction of industry to specific areas. Again, the Amendment does not change the situation. Whether we have metropolitan counties and metropolitan districts or counties and districts, all four authorities have concurrent powers, in partnership with any national governmental decisions and proposals, to attract industry in terms of acquisition of land for development purposes. Therefore the attraction of industry would not be dealt with in any different way.<br><br>
It is worth mentioning one point in the context of the particular proposals put forward by the hon. Members opposite in relation to Blackpool. It is very much for asking whether the special and successful holiday interests of Blackpool
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0293">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 531</span>
are more likely to be furthered by a district as proposed under our proposals, where it is related specifically to the county borough of Blackpool, or whether they are more likely to be furthered in a metropolitan district where, on population terms, Blackpool has only 50.5 per cent. of the population. It is very arguable that the other 49.5 per cent. of the population which would be added by the Amendment would be considerably less interested in the Illuminations and the holiday attracting facilities of Blackpool than the county borough is at present and is likely to continue to be in the districts, one of which will, I am sure, be Blackpool when the time comes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that a large part of the population is in other areas, such as Lytham St. Annes, Thornton Cleveleys and Fleetwood, which also have a certain amount of holiday activity?</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that is right, but there is a certain difference of approach to the sort of holidaymakers they seek to attract. It is arguable and something to be resolved when we discuss in detail the allocation of functions whether the district concept, such as we have drawn it, will be more tailor-made for the individual requirements of localities than the metropolitan district as proposed by the Amendment.<br><br>
We heard an eloquent plea from the hon. Member for Widnes for "proud Preston". An interesting case emerges here. If one looks at the figures, one finds that the area (d), which the Amendment includes, consists of 316,000 people, only 97,000 of which come from proud Preston. One is, therefore, in a dilemma, if one follows the arguments of the hon. Member. Either the proud Preston minority of 97,000 will dominate in some way the 316,000, or Preston, in my submission, will be in the much healthier position of being able to run its own district under the proposals in the Bill. I have no doubt that Preston will turn out to be a district. In the case of Preston, the feeling is that Preston will have a much greater opportunity to continue the traditions and the identity which was the subject of the hon. Member's speech, under our proposals than under the Amendment.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 532</span>
I have been asked for the breakdown of feeling amongst local authorities. I can help the Committee on this matter in broad terms. Those who are in favour of a metropolitan Lancashire are fairly equally divided. Seven authorities are in favour of the proposals: four of them are the county boroughs upon which the proposal will be centred. The seven authorities account for a population of about 475,000 people. Twenty authorities are against. They are more numerically, but they account for a population of 400,000 people. Therefore 475,000 people are claimed by their elected representatives to be for the proposal and 400,000 are claimed by their representatives to be against it. It is by no means a decisive question.<br><br>
So far, 20 local authorities have gone on record against the metropolitan county but it is interesting that, when the original proposals under 871 were published, 31 authorities replied accepting the non-metropolitan Lancashire. I have a list of the authorities who have let us know their decision. Those in favour are Blackburn, Blackpool, Burnley, Preston, Nelson, Barrowford, Padiham—and Barbara Castle, M.P. They have all made representations in favour of the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mrs. Castle is a local authority in her own right!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be very much in favour of a Bill to distinguish that authority!<br><br>
Those authorities that are against the concept of a metropolitan Lancashire consist of the Lancashire County Council, Lytham St. Annes, Fleetwood, Darwen, Clitheroe, Morecambe and Heysham, Leyland, the Fylde, Chorley—and David Waddington, M.P. Many authorities have not expressed any opinions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Leadbitter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Both sides must uphold the principle of the White Paper, that people on the spot must be taken into account. However, human nature being what it is and the type of local representation being what it is, there are often outside conflicting interests which force local authorities to make known opinions which conflict with the principle. While we must respect the opinions of local authorities, they do not represent the criterion upon which should be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0294">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 533</span>
judged whether an area should become metropolitan or non-metropolitan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is perfectly correct in what he has said. That is why the Government have to take the ultimate decision. I merely produced evidence to indicate the very widespread difference of opinion in this situation. The Redcliffe-Maud recommendations made it quite clear that the case for metropolitan status in the area was probably one of the strongest among the non-metropolitan areas.<br><br>
Amendment No. 165 has been referred to as a tidying-up operation—one which will be fought to the last ditch in a grandiose way by those tidying it up. The Amendment seeks to put Ormskirk into Merseyside. It was passionately felt by the people of Ormskirk, who came to one of the meetings we held, that they did not wish to see their totally agricultural town moved from the present Lancashire County Council into Merseyside.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Widnes raised the question of the central Lancashire new town and asked that it should have all powers necessary to create a coherent plan. The new town corporation would have precisely those powers, and it is for the Secretary of State, acting on recommendations from the new town authority, to incorporate those powers in the structure plan for the whole of the new county. The question of the planning of the new town is not likely to be affected by the proposals under discussion.<br><br>
This morning nearly all the arguments have centred upon the four districts where the case is easy to plead. A difficulty arises incases like <i>District</i> (<i>e</i>) with a total population of 123,476. In the northern area one is dealing with an area which is different in character and where a large number of people have no desire to be amalgamated into a re-juggled Cumbria. So either one has a hybrid situation where an authority is catered for in a way which is unsatisfactory, or one has to look to a wider area as the Government have done, to see what can be done within Lancashire itself. If the Government had accepted the concept of metropolitan districts with a population of 123,000 they would have been assailed by experts in various spheres, such as education and social services, as being totally irresponsible for doing so. They would have found themselves being pres-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 534</span>
surised by authorities with a population of 125,000 upwards to be given metropolitan district powers. That precedent would be quite unacceptable. There is no metropolitan district of that size, and for reasons which have been rehearsed in the generality of previous debates there could not be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister tell us what is the smallest size recommended for a metropolitan district?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Without checking, I should say 177,000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the difference?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference, but one has to decide at what point there is to be a cut-off. In our judgment—and later we shall be dealing with a metropolitan district of 177,000 people—it is the special case which qualifies. To reduce the number to 123,000 as proposed would be unacceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman give way? As the Government are determining the pattern for many generations ahead, have they taken note of the growth potential? In <i>District</i> (<i>e</i>) where the Government dealt with a special case, if there was also a growth potential there, that surely would answer the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman was referring to the central Lancashire new town, the potential growth did not come into it; it is a considerable way ahead. In the Bill we are not dealing with the specific implementation of a concept. We have built into the legislation a continually reviewing mechanism so that if circumstances changed in the way suggested by the hon. Gentleman, there would be no reason why Lancashire should not become a metropolitan county. Provision is made in the Bill to give a constant modernising effect to our proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister assure me that this cannot take place for 15 years, that it could not take place for 10 years after 1974?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, 10 years after the introduction of the legislation. I do not believe the figures are likely to have reached the scale within the period we are talking about to justify a change being made now. It would be easier to consider the position at the appropriate time.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0295">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 535</span>
If the hon. Gentleman wishes to carry out a review earlier, the possibility could be considered, but I do not think the argument for an earlier review would be acceptable. It is necessary to allow reorganisation to get under way. An exception could not be made for this particular area to be reviewed earlier, and it would be ridiculous for the whole country to be reviewed after five or six years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is on a point of considerable importance, and I am sure local authorities would like him to expand on it a little.<br><br>
He is now telling us that it is possible, under the review procedures of the Bill, to review local government in such a way that new metropolitan county authorities can be established. This raises the serious question whether the proposals with regard to Lancashire are based on long-term prospects. I should have thought that local authorities in Lancashire would have wanted the Government to get it right now to save upheaval later. From that point of view, would it not be better to look at the growth potential of <i>District</i> (<i>e</i>)? <i>Al</i>though at the moment the figures do not justify the case for a metropolitan area, looking as far ahead as we reasonably can, say in 20 years' time which is a time scale we should have in mind, if our thinking is right the case for a metropolitan area should be conceded now and we should not wait for a review later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a dilemma which the Government have had to face. We have taken the opposite view to that of the hon. Member for Small Heath. We do not think it would be right to create what in this case would be a very small, weak, under-populated and under-resourced authority in relation to the power which would be given to it, if at the same time we have provided that the situation can be kept under review. That is the most sensible way to deal with the problem and one which we would advocate to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the population of the smallest non-metropolitan county proposed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figure for that is 270,000. The smallest authority of any size is nearly 180,000, which is South Shields.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 536</span>
I should now like to deal with other arguments that have been raised with regard to the metropolitan status for Lancashire. It has been suggested that it would be difficult to find a suitable pattern of disrticts within the framework of towns that exist at present. Many proposals have been put forward for the 13 districts into which the new county will be divided and these have been met with a degree of acceptability from the local authorities. We shall be looking at that in the light of the Boundary Commission's Report.<br><br>
The argument has been put forward that there are now five well recognised centres, and that it is difficult, therefore, to see a new framework emerging and a new concept of loyalty. But this is taking the view as seen from one of the four county boroughs involved. They obviously look to the administrative centre of local government. However, if one is an inhabitant of a county at present, one is used to looking at a different centre. I have not the slightest doubt that under the proposals when they have settled down people will come to regard whatever is chosen as the centre of the new county as the focal point upon which the administration is based. That will attract new loyalties.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
I think the biggest single argument put forward, and the one that weighs most heavily against the Amendment, is the question of planning. The difficulties of hon. Gentlemen opposite—and I am surprised that they did not refer to it—come from the recent history of local government proposals in the area concerned. Every hon. Member opposite who has spoken has pointed to the need for a comprehensive planning structure in Lancashire itself to deal with all the problems on a large scale. That is a good argument. However, what I find difficult to understand is why hon. Gentlemen opposite put forward proposals which did not make this possible. An hon. Gentleman shakes his head.<br><br>
The proposals for Lancashire which were put forward by the Redcliffe-Maud Committee, and which were accepted by the previous Government, provided for four unitary all-purpose authorities, and for the dispersal northwards of the rural areas to the north of Lancashire. So there would have been four authorities, and of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0296">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 537</span>
a fifth, in the present Lancashire county which would not have had the ability to plan the region on the same sort of comprehensive scale as is now advocated by hon. Gentlemen opposite, and which is possible within the framework of our proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But the Minister should know that we are not discussing the proposals put forward by the previous Government. We are discussing an Amendment to introduce a metropolitan county-metropolitan district model, where planing on an overall level could take place in the metropolitan county. That is why this form of government is suggested for this area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the interesting thing is that when the hon. Gentleman's Government had a choice in this matter, instead of making a metropolitan county, which they did in South Hampshire to answer this very problem, they decided to stick to the four unitary authorities in Lancashire without any instrument at all being created for the overall planning of the area. This is the final collapse of the arguments which hon. Gentlemen opposite have put forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must recognise that there are two arguments opposing what he is saying. First, on a straight-forward argument of the reorganisation of local government, hon. Members supporting the Labour Government would have argued for a provincial council. Secondly, many of my hon. Friends who have spoken from this side of the Committee in this debate did not have the pleasure and privilege of supporting the last Labour Government. They were not present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully appreciate that many hon. Gentlemen opposite did not support the last Labour Government. Many of their supporters in the House did not either, which made it very difficult for them to get their legislation through. They had to abandon some of it, as we know. It was neither a pleasure nor a privilege from what I saw of it.<br><br>
The last Labour Government, faced with the decisions that we had to face, decided that there was no need for a comprehensive planning authority in this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 538</span>
area. We disagree with them, just as hon. Gentlemen opposite have now come round to the view which we are advocating. We are providing a planning framework within the new county. I believe that it is relevant, I believe that it is right, and I think that the Labour Government were wrong on this issue. That is a powerful argument in favour of our proposals.<br><br>
I put forward what I believe to be overwhelmingly the strongest argument in support of our proposals. The arguments put forward by the Labour Government were concentrated on the historical focuses of attention that exist in this area, and they were based upon the traditional loyalties to certain local government organisations.<br><br>
The concept that we are advocating is that there should be a new local authority, drawing its loyalty from all the people who now live in these areas. For the first time, all the people in Lancashire will be able to elect representatives to play a part in the management of that area. One small part will not be left out. It will be a partnership effort and the benefit to Lancashire of this powerful unit representing all the people will be immense.<br><br>
I believe that that concept will be constructively seized upon as an opportunity by the elected representatives who will come into being in 1973 in the two elections. It will be seen as one of the most dramatic and radical reforms of local government in that area, and as a launching pad for a new sense of purpose for those people taking part in local government in Lancashire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to be lengthy in my observations. I am not as convinced as the Minister about the case he has made out. Although I do not wish to prempt the debate about economics, because you, Sir Stephen, have already ruled, I should like to make a passing comment about a remark which was made by the hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed) concerning the whining and bleating on the regions. I was appalled by that remark. At some time Wales will be discussed in this Committee. I hope in our discussions about local government reform and what might happen in Wales we will not have that remark made.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Reed</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman allow me?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give way in a moment. Economics has much to do with large regional local government organisations. One cannot get away from the fact that economics is basic to reorganisation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Reed</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point is that many parts of the country have had to face difficulties every bit as severe as development areas. They have succeeded in helping themselves without a lot of the noise and fuss which has come from development areas. We, who are excluded from all the privileges of development areas, deeply resent some of the commotion that is caused in places such as Wales, Liverpool and elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not in the Chair when this intervention took place. We are not discussing development areas. I have no objection to the hon. Member replying to an intervention which was made in my absence, but he must not develop it for too long.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, Sir Stephen, I shall not. But that remark stuck in my mind, as I think it did in the minds of other hon. Members. When people in the regions talk about the right to work I do not think that it should be described as whining or bleating.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene only because this is an important point. The hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed) should withdraw the remark. The Chair should allow it to be withdrawn. While we on this side of the Committee, as do the majority of hon. Gentlemen opposite, support the idea that the regions have a self-help motive, we do object that in an area where the difficulties are most severe an imputation should be made. While my area was referred to, as elswhere, the position is so drastic that I hope the hon. Gentleman will respond to the Chair and bring this assertion to an end, and say that these regions do have an exceptional record of helping themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I really must point out to the Committee that I am not responsible for the views which are ex-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 540</span>
pressed by members of the Committee. I took the opportunity earlier, on a totally different subject, of saying that members are responsible for the truth of their own statements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Sir Stephen, I will help the Committee by now speaking to the Amendment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 165 seeks to insert the words
<br><blockquote><p>"Litherland and Ormskirk; The Rural District of West Lancashire."</p></blockquote>
This reminds me of a part of the country in which I used to work when I was employed by a teachers' organisation. It was in my parish, and I used to pass through it often. I would not call Litherland poetic, but it is a remarkable part of the North-West. The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) must know that part of the world well, and could probably give us many details about it.<br><br>
Ormskirk is a market town, set in the midst of pleasant countryside. The mediaeval church is worthy of notice. I first heard of it on the programme "Down Your Way", where mention was made of the two spires, one of which had been transported from a church some distance away. When I worked for the National Union of Teachers, I did not go about looking at mediaeval and romanesque churches, albeit that that is one of my interests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend agree that some of the schools he had to visit were little better than mediaeval in their condition?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. My hon. Friend has a good point. On the matter of schools in general, and education in particular—if I have my phraseology correct—in Ormskirk there is a large, fine and famous college of education where about 1,000 students are engaged in training to be teachers and to look after the children of the 1970s. That college has an interesting history. I will not burden the Committee with the details, but at one time it was the Edge Hill College of Education, based in Liverpool. The governors of that college were obliged to move out into the Ormskirk area because of a fire. Such an observation is surely in favour of the Amendment.<br><br>
The rural district of West Lancashire, as other hon. Members have already com-

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 541</span>
mented, is an area of some beauty, known for its estuarial and alluvial deposits. The soils are particularly black, and rich, and remarkable in their suitability for horticulture. The people are grateful to have been so blessed by Nature—if not with a Labour Government for the decade—and there is a great deal to be said for having every member of the Committee visit the area before voting on such an Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brynmor John</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend really think that we are to be blessed with a Tory Government for the decade?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An interesting speculation, but out of order on the Amendment. May I remind the hon. Gentleman who is about to resume addressing the Committee that I found his historical allusions to Ormskirk Church and the quality of the soil fascinating, but I find difficulty in relating them to the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it be in order to congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his perspicacity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You might ask the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) to explain that word, Sir Stephen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not on a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Stephen. I was about to say, and I take your point, that this area in the North-West almost equals the artistic potentiality of Constable. The skylines of the area and the rural district of West Lancashire are truly remarkable—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be aware that Turner, and not Constable, painted on Merseyside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to stray down that path, Sir Stephen, and I am sure you would rule me out of order if I did.<br><br>
It is a most attractive area. I am extremely interested in the organisation of local government there. In driving through the countryside I notice particularly the absence of hedging and the almost prairie-like nature of the fanning. In the summer it is most attractive.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 542</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that most of the area did not exist as land 100 years ago, because almost all of it was reclaimed from the sea?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that observation. Looking at line 45 in page 182, I note the urban district of Formby. This strikes a happy chord. When I was a National Serviceman based at Fulwood Barracks, Preston, we were transported by lorry as infantrymen to the famous shooting range of Altcar. There I learnt to fire my first bullets. This is particularly relevant to the Amendment. On clear November days when we were training, and when the Americans had their base at Burtonwood, we could see, high in the sky, the V-bombers refuelling overhead, which was something of a distraction to those of us trying to hit the target—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman's firing at Altcar was more on target than his remarks are to the Amendment. Would he please come back to it?</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) struck a sympathetic chord when he referred to Southend. Lines 45-55 mention some desirable residential areas in Greater Merseyside. I am a strong supporter of Everton Football Club, many of whose footballers live in the area, as do those of the rival team, Liverpool F.C.—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must rule the domiciliary habits of the supporters of Everton not relevant to the subject of our discussions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must now be brief, Sir Stephen. I have had many interventions.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter), if I may pursue a little further the sporting—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would rather the hon. Gentleman did not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—referred to squash, and his discussions on local government, with a colleague, during play. My hon. Friend's speech resembled the style of his play—gritty, tough, sturdy. Whilst I compliment him on this, I must mention that when he plays me he does not win.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should perhaps now re-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0299">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 543</span>
ply to some of the remarks of the Under-Secretary. I have been asked by my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) to apologise on his behalf. He has a luncheon engagement, but he hopes to be back with us when we next meet, to make one or two remarks before we dispose of the Amendment.<br><br>
Once again the debate has not been at all meaningful. The hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed) condescended to interrupt the proceedings on a couple of occasions. It should not go unnoted that whilst we have been discussing future local government arrangements and personal services to a million people, hon. Gentlemen opposite have not thought it worth while to make any contribution to the debate. The Opposition are debating with themselves, and if some of my hon. Friends are carried away, Sir Stephen, it is because of that circumstance. And the Minister may remark that he wishes that they would get carried away, but that is only a further example of the totalitarian tendencies of the hon. Gentleman opposite who, with his Under-Secretarial colleague, would no doubt wish to dispose of us, Burnley, Blackpool, Preston, Accrington and everybody else at a stroke—to coin a phrase.<br><br>
This brings me directly to the Under-Secretary's speech. He disposed of Burnley, Blackburn, Preston and Blackpool at a stroke, and almost without a comment. To be fair, he spent some time on Blackpool, and we shall be coming back to that, but we heard little justification for the state of suspense in which the industrial giants of central Lancashire—Burnley, Blackburn and Preston—are to be left, and the demolition of their case. When towns like these make out a convincing case for having their powers retained, that case should be answered with a reasonable degree of detail, and the substance of the case should be considered. That has not been done.<br><br>
True, when we dealt with the new town, the Minister was a little more forthcoming in his explanations, as he was in the case of Blackpool. I do not know what the people of Blackpool and its hinterland feel. I have described Blackpool as an important seaside resort. The large numbers of residents of Blackpool and its hinterland would feel themselves propertly aggrieved if the only account we were to take of their diffi-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 544</span>
culties and problems was as a seaside resort. As my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) pointed out when talking of Fleetwood—I did not know the figures until he drew our attention to them—there is considerable unemployment, and it is no consolation to tell the unemployed of Fleetwood that the future local government of their town is to be determined on the holiday attractions of Blackpool, which seems to be the situation.<br><br>
The local authorities have made out a convincing case to be unitary authorities—something which it would be out of order to discuss. Nevertheless one may express disappointment that the alternative now facing them, and the people in their areas is unsatisfactory to them.<br><br>
Referring to <i>District</i> (<i>e</i>) I am grateful that the Under-Secretary gave way to allow us to clear up some of the uncertainty as we went along. However, it does not seem right to judge the whole future of local government, its geographical, human and historic factors by some mathematical formula which the Minister or his advisers in the Department of the Environment think is correct. The result will be a series of nonsenses perpetrated around the country when they come to divide it up.<br><br>
However one tries to draw the map, this problem has to be faced. Although one wants an overall pattern of local government, there are bound to be some inconsistencies if one is to make any sense of the proposition as a whole. That has already been accepted in respect of the Isle of Wight. Whatever the solution for Hampshire, we are all agreed that no mathematical formula or philosophical proposition can contain the Isle of Wight reasonably or sensibly.<br><br>
To return to central Lancashire, I submit to the Committee—a case that the Under-Secretary failed to meet—that in <i>District</i> (<i>e</i>) in the Amendment there is a similar situation, although not nearly as aggravated as that of the Isle of Wight. It has already been conceded that the population of 123,000—the hon. Gentleman the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) seems amused. Perhaps he will share his joy with the Committee, or else try to follow the argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am merely admiring the hon. Gentleman's tie.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to learn
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0300">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 545</span>
of the intellectual level at which hon. Gentlemen opposite follow such serious matters as the future of local government in Lancashire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was thinking that the red circles on the black background were on a par with the hon. Gentleman's speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the kind of incomprehensible, inconsequent nonsense that one must expect of hon. Gentlemen opposite. When they do not understand when one is trying to argue a position on which we are all agreed, the difficulties of the northern part of the County of Lancashire in any pattern of Government for the whole of the County of Lancashire, one almost gives up. Perhaps I should withdraw what I said earlier, and thank God that the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) has no intention of speaking. The intellectual level of the effort required would be beyond comprehension.<br><br>
My point, and it is important, is that one cannot produce a neat and tidy pattern for the whole of Lancashire, but the case for a metropolitan county area for Lancashire has been well made out. It would not be too much of a discrepancy, as at this moment of time, to leave <i>District</i> (<i>e</i>) as it is, with 123,000 people. In determining the future pattern of local government for the next 20, 30 or 40 years—having been told that the justification for the Bill is that local government has not been changed for 100-odd years—we should take account of the growth possibilities of <i>District</i> (<i>e</i>), the town of Lancaster and its surrounding areas, and base our future judgments of the local government pattern on that proposition, which is what we are seeking to do.<br><br>
I turn to the question, which the Under-Secretary raised, of attracting new loyalties in the centre. There is not time to go into the whole matter of planning. We have reached what for the people of Burnley, Blackburn and Preston is the heart of the matter. They are used to having their services decided locally; to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 546</span>
going to their local representatives when they have complaints, and getting those complaints dealt with. The Under-Secretary cannot say where the new administrative centre is to be, but whichever centre is chosen, in the majority of cases the people of Burnley, Blackburn, Preston and Blackpool must travel many miles to meet their local authority members and their local authority servants, and to get their grievances dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not wish to mislead the Committee. He will appreciate that each of the authorities referred to will be a district in its own right, administering most of the important local services, and that each will have elected representatives all of whom will be closely associated with those county boroughs, or districts of county boroughs, and who will meet their constituents on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a part of our case that the districts under the counties will have nothing, like the powers that they should have, and they will not have the powers to deal with the problems which are likely to bear hardest upon these people. Having regard to the time-scale for elections of people serving on the county authorities, as laid down in the Bill, to redress of grievances through the democratic process will be distinctly limited, and that should be a factor in our thinking. We shall discuss that when we come to it.<br><br>
We have made out a case—an over-whelming case—for the metropolitan county area in East Lancashire, and I can only express profund disappointment that the Minister and his colleagues have not thought it worthwhile to take that point, even though, as the Minister fairly told us, there is a substantial body of opinion in the area itself in favour of so doing.</span></p>
