	<div class='title'>NEW LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS IN ENGLAND</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment No. 2 proposed</i>—(	<i>30th November</i>)—in page 1, line 10, leave out first "counties" and insert "provinces".—[	<i>Mr. Blenkinsop.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind hon. Members that with this Amendment we are discussing Amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 10, leave out second "counties "and insert "provinces", and Amendment No. 6, in page 1, line 12, leave out subsection (2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the very interesting speech of the hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) at our last Sitting, I was not quite sure, when he finished, which form of provincial government he was advocating. He certainly set out a number of forms early in his speech and toyed with a number of functions for a provincial body. The Amendments, on the face of them, merely substitute provinces for counties, which would mean, I assume, 38 provinces to take over the position of the 38 counties with something of the same powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could try to summarise the sort of propositions for provincial government which have been put forward from time to time, and I will start with the interesting one of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Berwick and East Lothian (Mr. Mackintosh), in a book called "The Devolution of Power". In this book he proposed directly-elected councils. This was mentioned in some of the speeches on this Amendment during the previous Sitting of this Committee—the directly-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>152</span>
elected councils for nine regions in England with similar assemblies for Scotland and Wales. The hon. Member for Berwick and East Lothian would have given these councils responsibilities much the same as those mentioned by the hon. Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) for provincial councils: regional planning, highways construction, major housing projects, police and fire services, higher and further education, hospitals and health services, and a number of other general functions
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one idea, nine directly-elected councils for regions. That, I think, would involve a complete reorganisation of the machinery of government and a reallocation of central and local government functions. The other propositions, including the Redcliffe-Maud one, do not go quite as far as that. They propose provinces as part of a new local government system without completely reorganising the machinery of both central and local government. Redcliffe-Maud, for example, proposed provinces as complementary to the unitary authorities which that Commission recommended. The minority report in the Redcliffe-Maud Report by Mr. Senior proposed provinces as complementary to the two-tier system, so that one had a sort of three-tier system. The Association of Municipal Corporations put forward the proposal for provinces as the upper tier in a two-tier system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Redcliffe-Maud proposed eight provincial councils for England; they would be indirectly elected with obligations to co-opt additional members. These councils would have the function of the strategic plan, and in exercising that function they would have bound the unitary authorities to follow out that strategic plan of the provincial councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Senior's proposals involved two operational levels, with 35 directly-elected regional councils and something over 148 other councils. The hon. Member for South Shields, I think, advocated at least consideration of Mr. Senior's proposals. Mr. Senior also had a third tier in the five provincial councils which he put on top of the 35 regional councils and the 148 districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come to the Association of Municipal Corporations' proposal for 12 regions for England, having a minority of executive functions as compared with the majority of functions in the most-purpose authorities which the A.M.C. have always advocated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>153</span>
That is a rough summary of the sort of proposals which have been put forward authoritatively for provincial government. The present Government's position is set out quite clearly in the White Paper and I will not go through them again, because I have mentioned them already. For the convenience of hon. Members I will mention that these proposals are set out in paragraphs 35 to 37.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In short, we accept that there are functions which need to be considered in a regional context. This, was a question which was asked by several hon. Members in speaking earlier to this Amendment. We do accept that there are. matters which need regional consideration. We want to keep that inverted triangle mentioned by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) the right way up. We want to keep the pyramid the right way up. We want a form of planning which will recognise that for the top of the pyramid, over a region, one has to look at matters from a regional point of view. We also accept the Redcliffe-Maud statement that local government services cannot be carried on either efficiently or democratically by a body covering such a large area as a regional or provincial council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not accept that the Redcliffe-Maud Report very clearly added the point that there was a place for the provincial council, and specified exactly how it might play an important part?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. As I said just now, we accept that there are matters not of the operation and administration of specific local government services, which need to be looked at from a regional point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think we must, however, before putting that structure in our government, await the recommendations of the Crowther Commission on the constitution. That does not mean that there need be any delay in going forward with the restructuring of local government proper, the administration of what we now understand as local government services. Local government reorganisation does not inhibit any further consideration of regional machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Crowther Commission is considering the organisation of central government, not local government, and we can, I am
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
sure, get on with the reorganisation of local government. Then, when we have the recommendations of the Crowther Commission, we can see what sort of structure is necessary between local government and central government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Meanwhile, the valuable work being done by the Regional Economic Planning Council will continue, and I agree with the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) that this sort of activity on a regional basis is a stimulus to regional economic growth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Shields was a bit suspicious about the reorganisation and strengthening of the departmental offices in the regions. I assure him there is nothing sinister about this. It is just a businesslike way of doing the Department's work, and it stimulates interest not only in local government in the regions but in the industrial and economic growth of the regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not provide for any form of regional or provincial government, and deliberately so. As I have already said, we are awaiting the recommendations of the Crowther Commission on the constitution. But that does not mean that the Department of the Environment has no regional outlook. The Department itself is regionally structured over a great deal of its work. Recently in each region we have brought under one roof and one regional director the regional work of the three Ministries which are the components of the Department. Therefore, in administration we have regional mini-governments. We have, for example, in Manchester, Leeds and Newcastle, something akin for the North-West, Yorkshire and the North respectively to the Welsh Office at Cardiff and the Scottish Office at, Edinburgh. I say "mini-government"—something akin to that in administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that there is a role for a level of activity between Whitehall, on the one hand, and the town hall or the county hall on the other. It is not a level at which local government services can be either efficiently or democratically operated but it is a level at which something more positive than a sandwich course for influential' citizens can take place or where a sort of "Keep 'em quiet study group" can meet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister because this is a matter of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>155</span>
some importance. What he is stating to the Committee is not at all in accordance with the views of Redcliffe-Maud. The opening sentence of paragraph 440 of that Report states:
	<br><q><p>"The purposes for which we think that a provincial council is essential as part of the total structure of local government will be best served by a body elected by the main authorities."</p></q>
It appears that Redcliffe-Maud and the Government are both agreed, and the Opposition for that matter, that there are certain fundamental strategic planning requirements and the operation of large-scale services which can only be done on a regional basis. The argument between us—Redcliffe-Maud and the Opposition on the one. hand, and the Government on the other—is whether this should be done by an arm of Whitehall in the regions, which is non-elected and not responsible to anybody, or whether we accept the Redcliffe-Maud view that this is best done by a democratically elected body, albeit elected by the main authorities who are themselves directly responsible to the public. Could the Minister tell us why the Government have rejected the Redcliffe-Maud proposal to have regional or provincial government, but to have a degree of democratic responsibility about its creation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) for putting his finger on the fundamental issue between us at this stage. I was just coming to that point in my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was describing what I might call an interim caretaker form of regional government administration. We have concluded that we ought not to decide this issue before receiving a recommendation from Crowther, but for reasonable business purposes we ought to be administering things as much as possible from the regions in order to take a regional view of it. Whether there should be at that level some people directly democratically elected, or elected on some electoral college basis or some membership 	<i>ex officio</i> in an elected body, is a matter upon which we await the advice of the Crowther Commission. But in the meantime, while waiting for Crowther, there is work to be done at such a level, and we have taken the common sense view that being in the mezzanine between the central and the local government floors
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
its personnel should be drawn from both landings during this interim period between now and Crowther.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work which we have for that type of regional administration is the preparation and monitoring of the Regional Strategic Plan for the development of the regions during future decades. The management and organisation of that work, with its team of professionals and experts, is in the hands, at present, of the Departmental Regional Office. The sponsorship and steering of it lies jointly with the Regional Economic Planning Council, appointed by the Secretary of State, and the Regional Standing Conference of Local Planning Authorities. In that respect, we are drawing from both floors in order to achieve this intermediate administration of government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Central Government appointees and local government elected councillors are drawn together to carry out at regional level something which is as nearly an executive act of government as dammit, for the strategic plan, when it receives the blessing of the Secretary of State, is the overall framework into which structure plans and local plans and, therefore, all future regional development, must fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is something which we think may be developed in the future when we receive the Crowther Commission Report. At least this regional administration is something which has a job of work to do at present. We are not delaying regional development, and just waiting for some commission to report. We have set things going, and if we have to adjust them later then we will do so, but this Committee is not the right place to make adjustments before we have received the Crowther Commission Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was agreed at the time when the Crowther Commission was set up. The right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition, then Prime Minister, in the debate on the Address in October, 1968, when he announced the Crowther Commission, at the time when the Royal Commission on Local Government was at work, stated this:
	<br><q><p>"… this House and other authorities concerned will be free to take action on urgent questions even ahead of the Report of the Commission….</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"What I have in mind, to take one example, is this: in the near future we hope to receive the reports of the Royal Commissions on Local Government in England and Scotland respectively.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0094">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>157</span>
Action to be taken following those Reports ought not to have to wait until the Constitutional Commission has finished its work."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 30th October, 1968; Vol. 772, 	<i>c.</i> 36.]</p></q>
Indeed, that is the view we have taken in drafting the present Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to delay the Committee again, but, as the Minister was not able to give way to me during his speech, I would like him to clarify two or three things he said and which cause me considerable concern. He used two phrases, "a sandwich course for influential citizens" and a "Keep 'em quiet study group". Would the Minister clarify what he means by those two phrases? Does he mean members of local authorities, trade unionists, industrialists, and academics who, over the past six years, have given up their time to serve on the Regional Economic Planning Council doing what they assumed was a job which successive Governments thought important? Indeed, the Minister paid a tribute to the Regional Economic Planning Council. Is he saying that all they have been doing is taking part in a "sandwich course for influential citizens"? If this has been a sandwich course, I trust the Minister has some appropriate diploma to award to them at the end of the day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I correct the hon. Gentleman? I was saying that I did not want the Councils to deteriorate into that. That is why we have given them a real job of work to do. Of course they are there to advise the Government on national matters which affect their region. I was using those phrases to mean that this is the last thing I want them to deteriorate into.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will read the OFFICIAL REPORT of today's proceedings with great interest tomorrow. But the Minister went on to refer to a "Keep 'em quiet study group". He then developed that point. Is the idea of setting up the North-West Study Group, in which the Minister chaired the Steering Committee earlier this year at Wigan, a "Keep 'em quiet study"? Local authorities are giving many senior members of their planning staffs to take part in this. Is this all a "Keep 'em quiet study" in which at the end of the day the Secretary of State will make some decision on a strategic plan? Would this not be answerable to anybody?
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
I hope that the Minister will clarify what he has said, because these phrases will cause considerable offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is most unfair. When I say that a body shall not deteriorate into something, I mean it. If I use some rather flowery phrases to explain myself, it is unfair for the hon. Gentleman to say what he has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is aware of my anxiety and keenness to put the regional economic planning councils and standing conferences of local planning authorities in a good position to influence the economic growth of the regions. For him to say that I have been making derogatory remarks about them is quite unfair. I hope it is realised that I was only trying to say that that is what they must not become. They have not become so because we have given them something in the nature of executive powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying the position. I shall read his words with great care in the OFFICIAL REPORT.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my view, the Amendment is exciting and imaginative and I am terribly disappointed with the response that we have had from the Minister this morning. However, I disagree with some of the remarks made by my hon. Friends, particularly when they have referred to reform of local government. In saying that, they are being too kind to the Government, because this is not reform of local government. Indeed, my first reaction to the Bill was that the Government were being unusually modest in describing it as local government reorganisation. When I had finished reading the Bill I altered my opinion. The Government were not being modest but unusually honest because it is not reform of local government; it is reorganisation of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could develop a strong historical argument for provincial government in this country, by referring to the historical divisions of England into Mercia, Wessex and so on. But I shall not do so because in reforming or reorganising local government we should look to the future and not to the past. It is because of changing functions which will have to be discharged increasingly in the future that we need provincial government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>159</span>
Neither provincial government nor the Amendment is inconsistent with the principle of unitary authorities. The Maud Report makes this point clear. Provincial government is in line with the Maud Report, and one of the reasons I supported a unitary system in the previous Amendment was that if we are to have provincial government in the future, with the Government's present proposal for reorganisation, we shall eventually have a three-tier local government in addition to central Government, instead of a two-tier system of unitary authorities and provincial governments. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I draw the attention of hon. Members to the fact that it is desirable that we should be able to hear what a speaker is saying. Some hon. Members do not realise that what they think are 	<i>sotto voce</i> remarks are more 	<i>voce</i> than 	<i>sotto.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After three years' consideration, the Maud Commission concludes:
	<br><q><p>"… that local government, however organised, needs to include a new representative institution with authority over areas larger than any city region, not unlike the eight areas of the present regional economic planning councils. This provincial council would handle the broader planning issues, work out provincial economic strategy in collaboration with central government and be able to act on behalf of the whole province."</p></q>
Elsewhere in the Report it is said:
	<br><q><p>"The key function of these councils would be to settle the provincial strategy and planning framework within which the main authorities will operate. They would replace the present regional economic planning council and collaborate with central government…. They will therefore play an essential part in the future adaptation of local government to the changes in ways of life and movement that time and technical progress will bring."</p></q>
I would emphasise the word "essential" in reference to local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister this morning completely neglected that part of the Maud Commission's Report. He has not said why the Government will not proceed with that part of the Maud recommendations. It is more serious when one realises that not only did the majority of members of the Maud Commission advocate provincial councils but Mr. Senior, who dissented from many of the recommendations, also advocated provincial councils. Therefore, we have the unanimous view from those who spent three years studying local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>160</span>
government that provincial councils are essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They were supported in that view by representations which they had received from the Association of Municipal Corporations and the Urban District Councils Association. There are many matters in local government about which these two bodies disagree, but they are united in saying that there is a need for some form of provincial council. What impresses me even more is that the National Association of Local Government Officers regard provincial government as important and necessary, and they are above party politics, although the Association of Municipal Corporations and the Urban District Councils Association may not be. The Government, therefore, owe it to the National Association of Local Government Officers to let those who work in local government offices know why they had to wait so long for action to be taken on this most important and necessary reform of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contrary to what the Minister said earlier, provincial government would not detract from the powers of county councils. Provincial councils would fulfil functions which are performed at the moment by central government civil servants, nationalised industries or other services—and this is the key to the whole issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Maud Report and several hon. Members have referred to the need for strategic planning. In the Report that is defined as covering the distribution of population, the location of employment and transport. I want to emphasise the importance of these issues as they affect people outside Greater London. I can speak with knowledge of the West Midlands, where there is a need to solve the conurbation housing problem. I said in a previous discussion—and I gave notice, Sir Stephen, that I would return to the point—that that housing problem could not be solved by the City Council of Birmingham, neither could it be solved by the West Midlands Metropolitan area. It could not be solved by the Maud recommendations or under the Labour Government's recommendations, and certainly not under the Conservative Government's recommendations. We need a regional or provincial—and I use the words interchangeably—approach to the problem. Only six months ago I was working in the constituency of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>161</span>
(Mr. Denis Howell). I could not have spent several years working in that constituency without being conscious of the terrible housing problem existing there at present. We need a much more radical approach to this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report and study by the Standing Conference of Local Authorities in the West Midlands has been a most useful initiative. However, implementation of that report requires a provincial, regional decision. It is not enough to produce studies. Studies and reports have been produced before, yet the slums of Birmingham still exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to refer to the problem of passenger transport in the West Midlands. At present there is a West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority, which has existed for several years. Only yesterday that Authority agreed, at long last and after a great deal of pressure from myself and other people, to make a contribution to the retention of a most important railway line in the West Midlands—the North Warwick Line. However, it is important to realise that this railway line runs outside the area of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority, whose area is too restricted. At a later stage in discussion of the Bill, I shall point out to the Minister that under the terms of the Bill the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority will be even more restricted, since it will be confined to the West Midlands conurbation, or West Midlands metropolitan area. Yet what is needed is a much wider area in order to solve the transport problems of the West Midlands.

I have said that I spent several years working in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Small Heath. In those days, as now, I lived in North Worcestershire, so that I have experience of the problems faced by commuters. Commuters travel into the West Midlands conurbation from all over North Worcestershire—from Bromsgrove, Redditch and Kidderminster, and from as far afield as Stourport and Bewdley. We in the West Midlands have a transport problem—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson) also faces this problem. I must admit that during the short period when I visited Kingston upon Hull I was not conscious of that problem, although I accept his word. However, I was certainly very conscious of this problem when I was living in Lancashire. Of course, it is a problem which faces other parts of the country. I am using the example of my own experience in the West Midlands merely for purposes of illustration, without claiming that we have a unique problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The restriction of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority to the West Midlands conurbation is extremely serious, and we cannot solve the area's transport problems in this way. I believe that we should look at a much wider area. For example, the North Warwick railway line runs outside not only the West Midlands conurbation—the West Midlands metropolitan area proposed by this Government—but through my constituency and into North Warwickshire, which has always been outside the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority. However, as I said, that Authority has finally decided to make a contribution to the cost of maintaining the line. Nonetheless, it is important to recognise that there are people in the West Midlands having a great interest in that line who have been unable to make any contribution, either financially or by way of discussion, to its retention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only last week the Secretary of State for the Environment admitted, in answer to a Parliamentary Question, that there had been no consultation with local authorities outside the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority area for over two years, and that even at that time the Secretary of State in the previous Administration had not initiated those consultations. This situation is quite wrong. If the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority had not changed its mind, but had insisted on not making any contribution towards the retention of the North Warwick line, the people of North Warwickshire could have done nothing about this problem, because they are not represented on the Passenger Transport Authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I should like to make one further comment about the problem of passenger transport. I have explained to the Committee that the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority have now changed their minds, and decided to support the North Warwickshire line. They intend to make a contribution from the rates. I find it rather strange that a contribution towards the retention of a railway line in North Warwickshire will come from the ratepayers of Bromsgrove and Redditch—to be fair, the line does run through my constituency—and also from the ratepayers of Cannock and of the Black Country, but the ratepayers of rural Warwickshire will make no contribution, although they will benefit from the retention of the line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Maud Report makes a point about which I feel very strongly, namely, that there is a connection between economic planning and physical planning, describing them, I believe, as inseparable. Certainly, there is an undoubted connection between the environment and the economy. This connection is at present recognised nowhere in local government. There are economic planning councils, appointed by the Secretary of State, while planning functions are discharged by county councils. There is no consideration of the economy at county council level; indeed, that would be quite inappropriate. Nor is there any consideration of strategic planning at regional level, except through the 	<i>ad hoc</i> body, the Standing Conference of Local Authorities. Even more important, there is no democratic consideration of the problems of the environment and of the economy at that level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning again to the Maud Report, I am surprised that none of my hon. Friends has pointed out two other functions which should be carried out at provincial level. Perhaps they expected that my hon. Friend the Member for Small Heath would bring out those functions, and I apologise to my hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
Friend if I am anticipating his remarks. However, the Report states, in my view rightly, that provincial councils should be responsible for cultural and recreational services. I entirely agree with that point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that connection, I will offer a brief illustration from the West Midlands. In Birmingham there is a most imaginative development, called the West Midlands Art Centre. It is no exaggeration to say that that art centre, which I certainly use and which I encourage my family to use, and which people from my constituency make up coach parties to visit, does not really serve the people of Worcestershire. Indeed, it has been necessary to imitate it by forming mini-leisure centres in my own constituency. There are other examples of the City Council of Birmingham initiating imaginative developments and labelling them, "West Midlands". To be fair, it is usually only the City Council of Birmingham which supports these developments with contributions from the rates. Nonetheless, there is a need for considering cultural and recreational services on a much wider scale than that of the City of Birmingham or the West Midlands Metropolitan area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my hon. Friends have implied that provincial councils would take over aspects of the nationalised industries, or other central government services. I must admit that I differ from them to some extent on this point. In my view, provincial councils would be able to operate very effectively in relation to nationalised industries, not as the masters of those industries but as pressure groups. Perhaps it is strange to compare provincial councils with parish councils. However, I have had some experience as chairman of a parish meeting. Anyone familiar with parish meetings will know that where one does not have a parish council one has a parish meeting. The chairman of a parish meeting is a one-man pressure group. I was constantly amazed, in that capacity, how often all levels of government responded to requests from the chairman of a very small parish meeting. I am convinced that we would obtain much-needed improvement in our public services and nationalised industries if a similar pressure group were operating—not a one-man pressure group but a council—on a provincial level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like other hon. Gentlemen, I receive many complaints about the nationalised
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>165</span>
industries, and central government services which are regionalised. Those complaints could well have been dealt with at a provincial level, rather than by a Member of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I should not wish it to be thought that I was approaching this problem only from a parish pump point of view. Looking beyond this country, one can see examples of countries where provincial government has been tried, and proved successful. It operates, I believe successfully, in Europe—in Germany and, to some extent, in France. We have experience within the British Commonwealth—in Canada and Australia—of provincial government. I agree that Canada and Australia are much larger than the United Kingdom, and there is a tremendous difference in geography. But provincial government has been tried and proved in much smaller countries than the United Kingdom. It is a success in the Netherlands and is an astounding success in Switzerland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Government to think again. By refusing at this stage to introduce provincial government they are turning their back on yet another unanimous recommendation of the Maud Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister this morning has said that he accepts the case for provincial government—but not yet. He said that provincial government was not a level at which local government functions could be efficiently and democratically exercised. He has missed the point. We are not asking for a transfer of functions from local government as it exists to a higher sphere or tier. We are asking for provincial government to exercise functions which are not in form at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regional administration as described by the Minister is not the same as regional or provincial government. We need a decision-making authority at the provincial level. This is the great difference between the Minister and my hon. Friends. The Minister is procrastinating. The Maud Commission was established five years ago, in 1966. Its Report was presented two years ago, in 1969. This is 1971, and we are now told that we must await the Report of the Crowther Commission. We shall then, no doubt, have to wait for the White Paper and then for the Government to present the Bill to Parliament. Meantime, nobody is exercising functions which my hon. Friends and I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
are urging the Government to recognise are not being exercised at the moment and which should be exercised at provincial level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made a quotation from my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition. I listened to it with interest but I do not think it supports his case. The Minister said that my right hon. Friend stated in the House that action on the recommendations of the Maud Commission would not be delayed in order to wait for the Report of the Crowther Commission. So be it. We have a recommendation from the Maud Commission that we need provincial government; indeed, the Commission says that provincial councils are essential to local government. The Minister owes us a better explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said, "We have given them a job to do". I listened to the Minister's description of regional administration as it exists, but I heard nothing new. The functions that he was describing have been exercised for several years at a regional level. They were being exercised at the time that the Maud Report was written, and the Maud Commission found the present system inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is that the Government are not keen on provincial councils. I am not surprised, because the Maud Commission obviously anticipated this opposition from central Government. In its Report it said that
	<br><q><p>"Government departments were not keen to have a provincial planning level in local government."</p></q>
It also said:
	<br><q><p>"The questions involved"—</p></q>
in provincial government—
	<br><q><p>"will be debated in representative provincial bodies; in consequence there will be a livelier awareness in both local and central government of the issues at stake and a better informed atmosphere for decision-making."</p></q>
It went on to say that the
	<br><q><p>"Provincial councils will of course be able to assume responsibility for many matters that now engage the attention of central departments …"</p></q>
I can understand that. But central Government and Whitehall do not want provincial councils. They do not want the opposition that would come from provincial pressure groups. Above all, they do not want to lose some of the existing functions of central Government. They do not want to re linquishany power at all to the provinces—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Goronwy Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene very briefly in view of what the Minister had to say this morning on this very important issue, an issue which will be of continuing importance whatever we decide this morning. He thrilled us all on Tuesday with a promise of a two-hour reply to this discussion. Another broken promise, but one for which we are ready to forgive him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) has indicated that he is disappointed with the Minister's reply, and he gave very cogent reasons for his disappointment. I think, however, that he would agree that the Minister has made an important statement this morning. We wish he could have gone much further, but we shall all, I hope on both sides of the Committee, study with very great care and interest what he had to say about future provision regionally or provincially for the government of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad to hear the Minister say that he will not decide the issue before receiving the Crowther Report, which means that he has an open mind, and presumably the Government—if they have a mind at all—have an open mind on this matter. The Bill should not leave the Committee or the House without careful consideration being given to the need for a regional or provincial tier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the "interim arrangements", as he called them. I think that he was referring to the strengthening of ministerial regional offices to which we have not fundamentally objected. Indeed, as my right hon. Friend the Member for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
Cardiff, West (Mr. George Thomas) and I know, there is great advantage in strengthening regional bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional planning boards have rendered very helpful service alongside the regional planning councils without having direct power to initiate reforms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I see it, regional planning councils would be subsumed in democraticallyelected provincial councils but the strengthened regional ministerial offices—the mini-Whitehalls to which my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) referred—would have a dual purpose. Obviously they would be responsible to the Minister, but they would also be serviceable to the democraticallyelected institution which would carry out provincial government. In that sense, we have no fundamental criticism of the strengthening operation which is in hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to one or two points which appear to me to have come out of this extremely useful and practical debate. I sincerely wish that Members opposite had felt free to participate. This is not a party matter. The Committee, the House and the country would have been advantaged if both sides of the Committee had contributed to this worthwhile discussion. This matter will recur later in the Committee and on the Floor of the House. It is a constant point of discussion in the country, especially among leaders of local government and those who have been frustrated in the past by the inadequacy of the tier arrangement to which we have been tied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two broad strands to the argument for provincial government. One stems from the increasing emergence of services which can best be provided and administered on a regional basis. My hon. Friends have given excellent examples, ranging over specialised services for the deprived, as my hon. Friend the Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) reminded us—children, the elderly and the handicapped—where the catchment area and the resources in scarce manpower and money do not coincide with the areas of the largest or most powerful counties, with one possible exception, namely, the regional county, to coin a phrase, of London. In London, since the setting up of the L.C.C. shortly before the beginning of the century, we have had provincial government, although without all the powers which my hon. Friends and I wish to see in operation everywhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
Such services as services for the deprived, and the consolidation and, therefore, the development of higher education, present a problem and an opportunity. Universities, polytechnics, colleges of technology, technical colleges, colleges of applied study and colleges of education require provincial agglomeration and coordination of higher education, so that manpower, expensive equipment and space can be better utilised, and there can be cross-fertilisation of tutorial skills and results.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could go on. I am tempted to refer to the many stimulating points on regional administration made by hon. Members. My hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) mentioned airports. There must be a national policy for airports since almost every municipal airport of any size becomes international. Within a given region there is need to co-ordinate and rationalise the activities of growing municipal airports. My hon. Friend referred to the commercial success of Ringway, in Manchester. Such success must be related to the difficulties encountered by the airport in Liverpool. I remember, as Minister, hearing glowing reports from Manchester, whilst from Liverpool, a few miles to the north, came constant complaints and requests for help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need for rationalisation of traffic and services is clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exciting possibilities of vertical and short take-off and the extension of helicopter services within regions—for instance, the hop from York to Liverpool, or Plymouth to London—and flat-roof takeoff and landing are regional matters of the future for which regional authority is needed. It is generally agreed that the emergence of such services postulates the emergence of a new tier of local government. It is how it is to be done that is at issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill suggests—I wish to be charitable—two ways. One is the enlargement of counties. We know the old, rather tired argument that many counties are too small and too poor to engage in services, and certainly to take on new services. The map as drawn by the Minister may create a number of larger counties which may be able to cope with a number of extra services, as they emerge, in a regional sense. That is not the answer. One of the prime reasons for local government re-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>170</span>
form is to get away from disparity. Parity is either national or it is nothing. The creation of more capable, competent counties to undertake services more efficiently, and to be poised to receive new duties, without creating a nationwide system whereby every area comes into the parity is no reform at all. It is duplicating, in perhaps a slightly less acute way, the very disparity which has bedevilled local government in so many areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made a note of 10 or 11 services which will have to be administered on a regional basis. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) quoted Redcliffe-Maud and made his point most effectively. How is it to be done—by enlarging the counties in the hope that most of the country will benefit from larger units, or by depending on the long-stop in Clause 175 whereby separate authorities come together for joint action? We have had that. We have it now. In general, the result of getting separate authorities together for a common purpose is not a merging of interests, but rather a conflict of interests. The Morecambe barrage is a classic example. I could name many others in respect of, not only water, which poses a peculiar problem, but transport, and the provision of overlap of specialised services in both higher education and services for the deprived. The haggling amongst local authorities about who pays for what is ludicrous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill gives only those two answers to the need, and they are no answer at all. The need is for a regional authority with a democratic base. There may be support for the principle of indirect election, but I was delighted to hear my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields come down squarely in favour of direct election. I am reminded of a point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin). Parish councillors have come to me about problems which the councils of which they were members were entitled to solve. There are such difficulties when the method of election is direct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult enough then, and in my experience it is almost impossible to get the electorate to feel a meaningful sense of relation with indirectly selected representatives on boards and joint authorities. Something happens on the way. The whole thing becomes blurred; there is a dilution of democratic interest from below, and equally, I think, of account-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>171</span>
ability from above. Very good men feel a weakening of the sense of obligation to account for what they do, because they have been put on these joint authorities—there have been two jumps over the abyss, one might say—and proper representation has fallen between the two edges of the abyss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second strong argument for provincial government is that put forward by some of my hon. Friends—I think the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) made this point very effectively—that we must have a democratic point of initiative and stimulus in the provinces; otherwise the provinces will wither away. The only way to do this is to provide a system of government to which people in the provinces can turn for real development within the province. I repeat, one must have national policy, but equally, one must have provincial initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The centrifugal forces of our day are very strong indeed, and they will be stronger if we enter the Common Market. This is inevitable. It is therefore necessary deliberately to strengthen the perimeter, so that the provinces which are now breeding grounds for manpower for the centre become a new life, a new stimulus for activity of their own. This is urgent if we are not to end up with an imbalance in our society in population, in the concentration of services and therefore an imbalance of satisfaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two spheres apparently separate but actually related in which this stimulus and initiative on a provincial level is urgent: that of industrial development and that of cultural development. The need for national plans and policies in both spheres goes without saying, but it must also be said that the provinces must have sufficient autonomy and resources to create their own momentum of progress both in industry and culture. One could go on about this for a long time. I feel very deeply that, although the Arts Council has excellent men and women serving on it, and in many ways does very good work, one cannot help but notice that the pounds go to Covent Garden and the pennies go to Newcastle. This is what happens, and there is insufficient delegation of resources and authority, in culture as in the location of industry, to the regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
We shall return to this when the most important part of the Bill is reached, Part II, when Welsh Members will seek to catch your eye, Sir Stephen, with a view to developing this argument a little more prescriptively in regard to Wales. We are fortified by the fact that my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West who leads for us in this matter has now safely returned from the "east", the better to solve the problems of the West.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disturbed by the Minister's reply, because I want to assure him that this is not a trivial issue at all, but one that is fundamental to one's whole approach to this Bill—not only on these benches. I had the opportunity of spending some time at the Town and Country Planning Association's annual conference today which the Minister, I think, will be addressing this afternoon. I was greatly impressed by the concern expressed by such a large number of those present at that very well-attended conference—from local authorities, professional men, and from the whole planning field, about the effects on planning of this Bill, and particularly this very point, about the lack of any provision or clarity about the position of the provinces. Therefore I want to impress upon him, and all the dumb Members he has behind him, that while they may be incapable of saying anything on this subject, and while this may not be the situation in their own areas, it is a matter of real concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there are proper and understandable divisions of opinion—I would not wish to suggest that there is unanimity—nevertheless, the number of those taking part in the Town and Country Planning Association debates that I listened to this morning, suggested that there was great and real anxiety, and a strong belief that unless some kind of provincial organisation were established, they believed that their situation as planners would be worse after this Bill is passed than before. I think the Minister will find this feeling very strong at that conference when he comes to address it. I am saying this because I do not want him to feel that this is in any sense a trivial matter that does not deserve fundamental consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One's whole attitude to whether this Bill is acceptable at all, and whether it can be made to work, depends very much
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>173</span>
upon our clear understanding of where the Government stand in this matter, at this kind of level. Unless we have greater clarity, it will inevitably mean that many of us will feel that we would be better off without the Bill altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer to one or two points. The Minister has indicated that in his view—I do not want to give any unfair account of what he said—the kind of administerial regional developments that were taking place must be regarded as purely interim caretaker arrangements, and did not preclude—he emphasised this—a review of this whole situation, and a reconsideration of what might be required after the Crowther Commission reported. I confess that naturally the previous Government also said that the final position with regard to regional matters and provincial authority would need to await Crowther.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may be so, but what I am concerned about is to see that provision is made now so that we can build upon it—make whatever re-arrangements may be required when we have the Crowther Commission report—but starting now to meet the very deep anxieties that are widespread throughout the country. They do not want to be flung back into this position of the continuous frustrating argument between the urban and the rural areas. Many of them are saying that this Bill, far from curing that condition, may even be making matters worse. This anxiety has been strengthened by the plea, almost, of the Secretary of State in referring to the way in which the metropolitan county boundaries have been restricted even further when we have the Bill in front of us. This is looked upon with deep anxiety. I hope that the Minister will be able to say something further on this matter on Report, so that we can more fairly judge how this whole structure as proposed in this Bill, fits into his vision of how matters at a provincial and regional level can be worked out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the Minister did not refer to the peculiar situation of Northumberland. We have not had any comment from him as to whether he agrees or disagrees with the views of so many people that the problems there can be more rationally dealt with, certainly on a planning basis, by the establishment of a provincial level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not yet dealt with the question
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
of water, although I believe we are to have a debate on the subject in the House at some time. Surely this is a subject which clearly comes within a provincial set-up? We have heard a lot of rumours concerning this, that the Secretary of State has tried to get one pattern accepted by the Cabinet, and that this has been rejected. I believe we are to have a statement on this in the House this afternoon. Here is an issue which cannot be dealt with except on a provincial and national basis. I think we are right, on this side of the Committee, to press this point. We are clear in our minds that this is something which is supported by large numbers of people who in the end may have to operate the system and try to make some sense of it. They just do not see how they will do so without some more satisfactory arrangements at provincial level than have so far been proposed. They see it as offering something of a hotch-potch of local planning authorities without any effective means of reconciling the conflicting aims. Could the Minister give us an assurance that he will make a fuller statement on Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take up the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Goronwy Roberts). My right hon. Friend dealt with how people react towards the centre. I do not want to make this a philosophical speech, but if the Minister, who is always a good listener and a very good democrat, will cast his mind back to the 1945 Election, he will recall that there was a slogan by the Labour Party. This slogan was: "Forge the link between the town hall and Whitehall". That was an important definition. We fought the 1945 Election campaign on this slogan. We won the Election and things happened subsequently.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was once the Member for that constituency, where a certain famous public school is situated. I know exactly what my right hon. Friend means by that somewhat delicate hint about my former incarnation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The late Nye Bevan in the Chamber once talked about democracy, and about the people as a whole, and he used an old quotation: "The hungry sheep looked up, and none were fed". It is important to feed the sheep. We usually talk about the voters as being sheep, lobby fodder and the like, but I am talking of people who are not sheep. I am talking of men who have had a long life in local government, and who, after 1945, thought that they mattered very much in Whitehall planning and Whitehall decisions. It is my experience that local government officials who come up to Whitehall one by one are often picked up, so to speak, by the Minister or the Permanent Secretary, and are then dismissed—in a very courteous manner, of course—back again perhaps to Humberside. In this connection I am thinking about certain financial disbursements in connection with roads inside Kingston upon Hull.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel there is a long distance between the town hall and Whitehall. There is a psychological need for something in between—a small local unit on Humberside or in Glamorgan with Whitehall at the centre. This is a psychological need in all walks of life besides local government. I know the Minister is not an elitist and does not wish to dispense decisions all around the United Kingdom, but if he would look outside local government he will find that the question of provincial organisation is absolutely universal in all other walks of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke of participation, and of how people who are local workers organise themselves. Let us consider sport. Football does not have local government unit leagues. It has provincial leagues, which are in between the national organisation—the Football Association—and the local Sunday School league at
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
local level. This applies to all walks of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that I must not pursue this matter, Sir Stephen; but take, for example, the case of pigeon fanciers and pigeon racing. This is served in the same way. There are the North-East combinations, the Welsh combinations, and so on, and people organise their activities in local life on this basis. There is always this half-way house between the local, parochial or urban unit and Whitehall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister take into account the fact that in this modern society, which is not permissive but in which many people make their views known and often take their own decisions, irrespective of the centre, there is a need for this middle belt between the chap at local level who feels neglected and Whitehall. I am talking about powerful local city leaders; never mind people who discuss matters in cultural and other spheres. There is an organic desire for something in between.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told about the need for planning. It was mentioned that a certain association is meeting in a hall nearby. I belong to the same field in academic life as a gentleman whose name is Senior. I have taken a lot of care to look at Mr. Derek Senior's text. I accept much of what he says, but I accept even more what he said at another association meeting, which was quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) earlier. I will not go into controversial matters like "a Minister's ploy", but I accept in substance his argument, particularly in the context of Cheshire—I shall not deal with that, since I am not a Chesire Member—and Northumberland where I was born.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept all that was said earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop). I think it is fatuous to have a town like Alnwick, where I was at school, with a large area of land surrounding it. Northumberland is perhaps not only the bonniest but the most open county of any in England. However, in the sphere of local government division, Tyneside—a conurbation of 2 million or more—which will need land in the future for its planning, its housing and overspill of population, will need to have something between itself and Whitehall in order to look at this matter in a north-east context, to discover the needs of the people of the region

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>177</span>
during the next 10, 20 or 30 years, in terms of living as a society. If they are to organise themselves in sport, and other activities, some kind of mechanism will be needed in local government whereby they can meet together and reach agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They will usually reach agreement. People who live, work and play together, and who marry, have more chance of reaching a significant, lasting agreement together than in going to Whitehall in pockets and snippets to talk to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will cite another example of a problem which should urgently be settled. My hon. Friend the Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall) is with me in this. We need an airport. Who is to settle the question of Thorne Waste, which we consider to be a magnificent site for an airport within this area of wider Yorkshire—for Yorkshire, as well as being a big county, has tentacles over the county boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Humberside will now form a new county. We welcome this. We believe that we shall bloom and expand, with the help of Lincolnshire. Nevertheless, the future Thorne Waste airport will go much wider than Humberside, and much wider than Leeds, or Sheffield, Wakefield or Don-caster. Who is to settle this question, before local competitive factors come into play? Will they all appear in separate units, or as a disciplined delegation, who will meet only on the morning on which they see the Minister to place their competing claims before him? I submit, in whatever field one cares to argue—psychological, mechanical or struc tural—there is a need for a middle mechanism or organisation between the councillors, the elected members at local level, and Whitehall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I shall quote Mr. Senior. I am in good company when I quote Mr. Senior:
	<br><q><p>"He"—</p></q>
Mr. Senior—
	<br><q><p>"wanted to stress that a city region was not a region dominated by a city. It was a region, including a city or conurbation, that had become the social equivalent of what a city used to be. Strategic planning really required elected and well staffed provincial councils."</p></q>
I shall conclude on that note.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to detain the Committee very long. My right hon. and hon. Friends have made many valuable points. Perhaps I may refer in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
particular to the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), who, I thought, went to the heart of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to refer to a point made by my hon. Friends the Members for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) and for Widnes concerning the responsibility for water supplies. I think that that goes right to the heart of the case which we seek to make concerning the need for a structure at provincial or regional level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The total rainfall of the British Isles is 15 times as much as the present annual demand. One would think that with such a supply there should be no water problem. Yet, in many parts of the country, particularly in the eastern districts, because of the maldistribution of the rainfall, which is concentrated in the predominantly highland parts of the West, serious problems exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Government were waiting for the report of the Crowther Commission before a decision was taken concerning provincial action. I think it is fair to ask him whether the allocation of water responsibility to district level is a holding operation, or whether he intends to consider its possible transfer to provincial level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we may be forgiven for being a little sceptical about the Government waiting to consider a report when we think of the very cavalier treatment afforded to the prolonged and thorough deliberations of the Redcliffe-Maud Commission. However, if the Government are really concerned with examining evidence, I should like to emphasise to the Minister that ever since the 1944 White Paper, which called for a much smaller number of water undertakings, the trend has been towards larger and larger units, and larger and larger areas of control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brynmor John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made his point in connection with the water supply. Would he not agree that our suspicion of Government sincerity in this connection is heightened by the fact that, certainly in Wales, the Conservative Party did not deign to give evidence to the Crowther Commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John). I agree that the point he has made is subject to a very sinister interpretation. I also agree that Wales has a particular interest in the question of water supply,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>179</span>
because so much of eastern Britain is dependent upon it for supplies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister not agree, given that he is concerned with the evidence and conclusions of the Crowther Commission, that, emerging from the immediate postwar period, Circulars 52/56 and 41/58—both of which stress the need for larger units for water supplies—together with the Proudman Committee, which discussed the need for overall planning, all point in the direction of a provincial or regional structure? Indeed, with reference to the Redcliffe-Maud Report, the evidence of the Institute of Water Pollution Control stressed the advantages of a large regional authority, as did the report of his own Department, the Central Advisory Water Committee. Hon. Members will recall that that report stressed the need for an action programme to be drawn up on a regional or provincial basis, and also highlighted the conflict of interest, where a multiplicity of small units exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Minister, that although all the evidence over the years has pointed towards the need for a provincial council, able to deal with these problems of water supply, his own Bill allocates this vital function to district level, and that, as the hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) said, if rumour as typified in 	<i>The Times</i> is correct, we are shortly to have a statement that the Minister has given way to entrenched pressure groups and has conceded that water authorities are to remain on the same small scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus I make the following, as a nonparty point. Over the years, the remorseless logic of everything which has been produced about water supplies points at least towards control by a powerful provincial body, and on this side of the Committee, although we would not expect the Minister to go entirely with us on this, we would say that it points towards the need for very substantial public ownership of the whole industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can have some sort of response from the Minister about this, because it seems that in the one tangible instance which I have cited, the fair words, when it comes down to reality, will not be backed by action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Edmund Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish first to pursue the point just made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks), in saying that it is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
essential that we have some form of provincial or regional authority to deal with water supplies, the functions now carried out by river authorities, the conservation of water, navigation of our navigable rivers, and the carrying out of land drainage functions. I wish to relate this in particular to the province of Yorkshire and Humberside, in which my own constituency lies, because it is perfectly clear from any understanding of the geography of that part of the country that the whole of the river basin emptying into the Ouse and the Humber is one unity so far as water is concerned. Certainly the functions which I have mentioned with regard to the E4 provincial authority, are functions which have to be carried out at that level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yorkshire and Humberside is a part of the country which is taking a veritable battering under these proposals for local government reform. I want at this stage to say a word in defence of the sense of Yorkshire pride, the sense of provincial consciousness which is very widely present throughout Yorkshire. I know that on this I shall be supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson), and I had hoped that I might have been supported by the hon. Gentlemen the Members for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Spence), and Shipley (Mr. Fox), whom I do not see in the Committee at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Yorkshire there is a greater feeling of belonging to the whole of Yorkshire than there is of belonging to any individual counties that may be constructed within Yorkshire. Yorkshire has been three counties administratively for a very long time, but I submit that people in Yorkshire still feel that they belong much more to Yorkshire than they do to any one of the three Ridings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the proposals outlined in this Bill, the whole map of Yorkshire is being changed beyond recognition. The counties are being re-aligned into three major counties, West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and North Yorkshire; parts are being transferred to Humberside and to Teesside; part is even going into Cumbria, and finally, part is going, I regret, to the old enemy, the County of Lancashire and to Greater Manchester.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend begins his argument on the socio-geographical basis, since the Humber—not

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
the Ouse—and its hinterland is one entity, would he not think that the south bank of the Humber is a good addition, and that it is a nice thing to have these Lincolnshire men joining us in this fashion, to build up a lower basin together on both banks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his wise words in this respect, and I assure him that I have always been a Humberside man. As somebody who spent many years of his youth in North Lincolnshire and worked for a time in the City of Kingston upon Hull, and now represents the constituency of Goole, I think I can count myself as being the prototype of Humberside man.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned in his speech earlier to the Committee the position with regard to sporting activities in Yorkshire, and here I think we have a serious point, because Yorkshire is a part of the country in which there is a very great sense of pride in county sport. Here I must declare an interest, because I am a member of the Yorkshire County Cricket Club. I am afraid that we have not had a very good year, but those difficulties have been added to by virtue of the fact that under this Bill a very great problem will be posed to the Yorkshire County Cricket Club. Members of the Committee will recall that there is a rule in the Yorkshire County Cricket Club that the only people who can play for the county have to be born inside the county. What they will do under these proposed arrangements I shudder to think, because it will be very difficult to define what exactly is meant by Yorkshire. It seems to me that there has to be some clear recognition of a Yorkshire province in order, among other things, to facilitate the County Cricket Club in the problem that it will face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The economic situation in Yorkshire, which is one of immense concern to so many hon. Members is something which requires to be tackled essentially at a regional or provincial level. The division of Yorkshire into the counties now proposed is dividing up many of the areas of common economic activity in Yorkshire. The Yorkshire coalfield will be divided between the counties of West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire, and there is one colliery which happens to be in my constituency, at Kellingley,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
which will find itself, under these proposals, in the County of North Yorkshire. I am told that the future development of the Yorkshire coalfield will be likely to move further into North Yorkshire, into the areas around Selby. It seems to me, therefore, that any measures of economic planning have to be on a regional, provincial level. In the matter of motorways this also applies. Motorways streaking right across the present County of Yorkshire also call for common planning on the regional level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I would take up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West when he talked about the need for provincial airports authorities. I would add one point first to what he said with specific reference to the Thorne site, which has been suggested as a possible airport site. It is a fact little known that the actual site suggested for Thorne airport is straddled by the proposed county boundary between South Yorkshire and Humberside. The site would be on two sides of that county boundary, whereas at the moment it is entirely within the West Riding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need for such an airport, whether it be Thorne Waste or elsewhere, is something which is currently being considered, and the site is something which has to be considered entirely at a regional or provincial level. There are strong feelings in parts of Yorkshire that the present Leeds-Bradford airport should be extended and regional needs met that way. At this moment, there is a special study commissioned by local authorities covering many different parts of Yorkshire, looking into the traffic flow, and the demand for airports covering the whole of that region. If the right place is to be found for an airport serving that part of the country, it is essential that such planning and such consultation should go on at a regional level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister in his opening speech this morning was right in saying that there was a deep divergence of principle between the two sides of this Committee on the real nature of our provincial authorities. As I see it, the point of view put by the Government is that regional authorities would be regarded as executive arms of central government. "Mini-government" is what he called them. I think that hon. Gentlemen on this side of the Committee would regard regional authorities as not being handed down from above but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0107">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
thrown up from below, whereby there is full democratic representation and responsibility because of direct election by the general public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a deep division between the two points of view. The arguments I have put relating particularly to Yorkshire show that we need provincial government which is democratically elected and responsible to the people as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Lamond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing a very interesting and important Amendment. Therefore, the silence of hon. Gentlemen opposite is disappointing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend would like to know that it is for his speech that the whole Committee has been waiting, and that there is now a majority of hon. Gentlemen opposite against us on this side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One might put that construction on the sudden increase in the attendance in the Committee. However, modesty does not permit me to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to damage my hon. Friend's ego, but would he accept that another possible explanation is that hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not like to speculate on the true explanation for the increase in attendance. I merely note it with pleasure and hope that hon. Members will listen with attention to the points I propose to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson) made a striking point when he drew our attention to the development which takes place naturally in almost all spheres of interest in our society. He gave one or two examples from the sporting world and demonstrated how people who are interested in certain sports find it necessary, by a natural process, to organise themselves in such a way that they have provincial councils. In other words, they feel a need for co-operation even in such limited interests as pigeon racing. This is also true in the business world where sales forces are divided into regions or provinces. Our experience clearly shows that this is likely to happen in local government whether or not provision for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
it is made in the Bill. It has developed in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can speak from personal experience, and, although it may not be a happy illustration because it took place under a Government of my political persuasion, I can remember some Ministers trying to encourage us to get together on a provincial basis to discuss strategic planning and the tourist industry. They were astonished that not only did we agree with them but that we have been operating such a system for many years on a voluntary basis. We had found it absolutely necessary to work on such a basis if progress was to be made in these activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also participated in what might be called official regional or provincial boards, such as the water board which was set up recently. There is no doubt that legislation which introduced wider areas of coverage for water boards benefited many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the question whether members of a provincial government should be appointed or elected. I am not strongly in favour of their being elected, although after considering all the aspects I come down on that side. I think a balanced judgment has to be made. Regional hospital boards, which are appointed, are an example. I have known many members who have given excellent and worthwhile service to such bodies. But I know from my experience with trades councils, old age pensioners' bodies and women's guilds that there is a lack of understanding of the structure of regional hospital boards and the hospital service as a whole. This is partly due to the fact that the general public play no part in the election of members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that bodies of various kinds, such as trades councils and trade unions are invited to submit names for consideration by the Secretary of State for appointment to regional hospital boards. It is never understood by members of these bodies why one person is chosen and not another. There is a suspicion among some members that if a person is too outspoken and too strongly supports the general public against bureaucracy he is liable not to be reappointed when his term of office expires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
.12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One further point I must make in favour of appointing members. The water board on which I served consisted of members
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0108">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>185</span>
appointed by local authorities from among their membership, and these members, who came from county as well as city areas, were less inhibited in the spending of money, particularly on capital projects. I recall one incident where a county had existed for many years with what was obviously an inadequate water supply because the county council was not prepared to pay the capital sums necessary to develop a proper water supply. As soon as members of that county council were joined by members of the city council they quickly brought forward schemes which were neeessary for the well-being of the people in the area because they had freed themselves of the idea that the level of rates was all that was important in local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcomed that, although the people I represented had to bear a large part of the additional cost. It was astonishing how urgent and important projects became. I remember one which we were told had to be done within a fortnight otherwise the pipes in the area would become useless. When we asked how this was known, we were told that a consultants' report made two years earlier had said so. Nothing had been done about it until the larger water board came into being.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not object to the spending of money if we get value for it. Therefore, one might say that the advantage of having a non-elected provincial council is that it frees itself from inhibiting ideas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to intervene earlier because I felt that if I had confined myself to an intervention on the principle of hospital boards I might be out of order. My hon. Friend has projected his thinking to provincial councils. While there might be some merit in what he has illustrated, many of us are worried about how the appointments are made and who is appointed. Labour representation on hospital regional boards is often overridden by professional dominance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Oldham, East (Mr. Lamond) will not be misled into discussing that matter, which would not be in order on this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. My hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East (Mr. Lamond) has been referring to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
provincial councils. I think that I am entitled to an answer from him. I am expected to vote on this Amendment and I should like to know whether we are in accord.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Oldham, East will take my advice and will not be led into a discussion on the composition of hospital boards, which would be quite inappropriate to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Stephen. I will certainly take that advice, but it would be fair to assure my hon. Friend the Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) that I share his opinion on the question of election to various bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that it was a balance of judgment, with advantages on either side, but in the end, if we are to encourage interest and participation by the community in these matters, direct election to these bodies is essential. I can remember arguing the point at a special session of the S.T.U.C. some years ago, although I was disappointed at being the only person present to say that direct election was essential. I still hold that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important aspect of the work of provincial councils would be the development of their areas and the attraction of industry. I am interested in the North-West Development Association, which receives very little encouragement from the present Government. Development associations go under various names, although their objectives are the same. There are many prominent Tories on these bodies whose main work is to combat the effects of the free market system—to try to prevent the pull exerted by the South-East of England which is now felt by almost every other part of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those who are interested in these associations are busily engaged in trying to rectify the glaring faults of the free enterprise system. Among past colleagues on such boards—I used to wonder where all the Tories in Scotland had gone—were many prominent members of the Tory Party, who argued that we could no longer rely on free enterprise to bring prosperity to the provinces. Provincial councils can be expected to take over this important work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, it is essential that we support the Amendments. Whether
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>187</span>
or not we agree to include them in the Bill, provinces will grow naturally and will play a valuable part in local government. Better that we provide a structure for so essential a part of local government within the Bill and that those who are trying to operate local government realise that we appreciate and understand what we are trying to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

to the Bill, although there is a direct relationship, but because it provides some guidelines for the future. I am grateful, and I believe the Minister is, too, to my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) for raising the point so eloquently and moderately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provincial government and the desire for it are clearly in the air. I know that there has to be silence from the benches opposite, even on important questions such as this, but I can assure the Minister that that makes no difference to the amount of time the Amendment will take. If ever hon. Gentlemen opposite want my advice, they should ask for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Listening to my hon. Friends and to the Minister, who made the only intervention from the benches opposite, I was struck by the almost unanimous view that there should be some kind of buffer authority between central Government and the local authorities. It was interesting to hear such similar views from my hon. Friends, and also their differences. The matter has obviously been well thought out, and is deserving of considerable attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South Shields has given his views, and we have heard some admirable speeches, all to the point. I was most impressed by the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Goronwy Roberts). I had hoped that another right hon. Member with a Welsh interest would also have spoken, because Wales has special and interesting problems. My right hon. Friend's intervention was clear and decisive. Since this matter has been ventilated at so many levels and so interestingly, I should like to limit my speech to a number of practical points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I want to take up the Minister's point on timing. I hope that he will listen carefully, because this has been so fossilised in the approach of various Ministers and speakers that we are perhaps losing track of an important point which I hope the Minister will consider in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the statement of my right hon. Friend the then Prime Minister in October, 1968. My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) made a very good point upon that when he said that my right hon. Friend was telling us not to bother about Crowther for the moment but to let Maud go ahead, and make recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>189</span>
I believe that Maud started his examination of local government reform in June or July, 1966, I cannot remember the exact date, but it would have been about that time. Obviously when my right hon. Friend spoke in October, 1968, Maud was not far off reporting, and in fact reported in June, 1969. Therefore, in October, 1968, the next development was to be a near view of Maud. There can have been no doubt on the part of any hon. or right hon. Gentleman then present that Maud would refer to provincial councils. That was natural, and, although the Crowther Commission was proceeding on its way, what Maud had to say was clearly of great importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland), when he was Secretary of State, said that, Maud having reported, we should get on with local government reform as waiting for Crowther would so delay local government reform that it would not be worth the wait. That is a tenable argument, to which the present Secretary of State for the Environment is a late convert. The Secretary of State has said that he has been wrong—a brave thing to say, because politicians do not always admit to being wrong—and that it would be better to go ahead with local government reform or reorganisation ahead of Crowther. But he said that in May, in the debate on the White Paper, and we are now in December. I do not know when Crowther will report—perhaps the Minister of State, Home Office will give us some indication—but it cannot be very long, on anybody's showing, and to that extent we are much nearer what may be a vital intervention in the scene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see the argument. The Minister may say that if we want him to put into the Bill something to provide for provincial rule, a buffer state, it would be ludicrous if we did that and then found that Crowther had recommended something totally different. Crowther might come out against provincial government altogether. We do not know, none of us can say. The Minister has had no hint at all. There is no reason why he should have had. I can sympathise with him on this point. The Minister is treading water, waiting for Crowther, and knowing that his Bill—or it might be a Home Office Bill—might well implement something recommended by Crowther.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
Since provincial government is in the air, it is clear that in some form or another, whether or not Crowther is in favour, it is bound to come. It is evident from every speech I have heard from this side, and from the one speech we have heard from the opposite side of the Committee, that some form of provincial government will come. While I sympathise with the Minister in his point on Crowther, he is not bound to accept Crowther when it comes. We do not know what Crowther will say. Some tentative beginnings of what could develop into a provincial council might well have been provided for in the Bill. I do not know. I would recommend that my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields should not press the Amendment to a Division. It is right that we should have had a full discussion, but it is not a matter on which I would want to support my hon. Friend in a Division should he press the Amendment. It is enough to probe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I am disappointed that the Minister's reply is so guarded and inhibited. I know he takes the view that he is making interim proposals. That is something of a giveaway, because I would take "interim" to mean before changes take place. Why have interim administration unless there is to be some kind of change? One can continue with the old basis. He must believe some form of provincial council to be necessary. I am worried at what he regards as suitable alternatives to a provincial council and to provincial government. He seems to take the view that Pope took:
	<br><q><p>"For forms of government let fools contest; Whate'er is best administered is best".</p></q>
That was a very good 18th-century doctrine, but we are living in the 20th century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I accept that there is a balance, as my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East pointed out, between the arguments in favour of a democratically-elected provincial council or an appointed one, that is always the argument. It is a part of politics. As the late Adlai Stevenson pointed out, democracy is an awful system, but there does not happen to be a better. As far as the selection of provincial councillors is concerned, any of us could get together a far better team than any electorate would provide. Perhaps we could appoint better Members of Parliament than the electorate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>191</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that in defining "better" we get into difficulty? A "better" councillor might mean one more likely to conform to authority. The councillors I prefer would not do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the valid point. That is the unanswerable argument in favour of participation. I hope that we shall later consider provincial councils on the basis that they are democratically elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said that I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields for raising this issue. The more I hear my hon. Friend on this point, the more I realise that we have had a "Blenkinsop Commission" which has proved quite as valuable on this matter as the Crowther Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East raised the question of a balance between a democratically elected and an appointed council. Having decided that balance, and having agreed that it should be democratic, I come back to the Minister. The Minister believes—and this seems to run right through the Bill—that local government is a matter of powers, perhaps local powers, or power. He does not seem to realise that it is very much a matter of participation—not participation between councillors and Government, although obviously that is his remit as a Minister, but participation between the electors and the councillors. He should have been more forthcoming about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it is a difficult problem, although now less difficult since the Crowther Report is nearer than it was in October, 1968, when my right hon. Friend made his statement. Having said that, and in the light of the possibility, or perhaps probability, that Crowther will be reporting before we have finished our deliberations, there are two questions for the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, would he tell us what would happen if Crowther did report in favour o provincial councils while we were still deliberating in Committee? Would he consider Amendments to the Bill? Would he be thinking in terms of a later Bill, or what would his attitude be? I do not think that the usual answer which Ministers of both parties give, that this is a hypothetical question, is acceptable to the Committee. We want to know exactly what his view will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>192</span>
Secondly, since the Minister used the word "interim"—I do not want to pin him on something that he may have used spontaneously—it is the Government's feeling—I put it no higher than that—that whatever Crowther may say, they believe in some form of a provincial council? Could the Minister be more definite on those two points?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I come to those questions which the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) has posed to me when I have dealt with one or two other points. They are important questions, and perhaps I can dwell on them a little longer than the other points which have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) made one comment which I wish to correct. He said that regional councils are doing now what they were doing at the time of Maud. This is not so. The Regional Economic Planning Councils were set up by the previous Government to advise the Government on national matters as they might affect the regions. When I came into office I found that the Regional Economic Planning Boards were enthusiastically feeding those Councils with a great quantity of paper, and advice was coming through on that basis. That is why I used the words, upon which I was taken up, that they were in danger of becoming study groups not producing anything other than good advice on which we might work in the future. We therefore decided that they should go ahead with regional strategic plans and thus do something more specific than just advising the Government. Those Councils really are doing more now than they were doing at the time of Maud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Goronwy Roberts) paid a tribute—and I thank him—to the Regional Economic Planning Boards. His phrase about the dual purpose of a "mini-Whitehall" is very apt in that respect. I think that if we set up some level of government in between local government and central government, as we now know it, the Regional Boards will serve a dual purpose. That is why we are strengthening them purely on an administrative basis but, in future, they may be put on a more governmental basis than at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one point which I find very difficult to reconcile in this debate, and especially in the well ordered and logical argument
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>193</span>
put forward by the right hon. Member for Caernarvon, who was trying to reconcile his argument with the arguments that we heard on the previous Amendment, is the argument for unitary authorities. How can one argue for the unitary system of all-purpose authorities, and then say, in almost the same breath—and I quote the right hon. Gentleman—"Ten or eleven local government services will have to be administered on a regional basis"? Either one accepts the unitary basis or one accepts a division. We have accepted a division as between counties and districts. But we also say that we recognise that certain matters ought to be looked at on a regional basis, and we are waiting to see the best way to deal with these.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the Minister agree that the A.M.C. in their evidence to the Royal Commission put this point very clearly? They saw the province as the major planning body with a limited number of functions, but they were mainly plumping for what they regarded as a unitary authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The way my mind is working now—-I ask right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite not to tie me to this because I am anticipating Crowther perhaps—is that a regional or provincial authority would not be undertaking local government services as we understand them at present. They might well undertake certain central government services on a regional basis. But I cannot see local government services as we understand them, except perhaps water which the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) mentioned—and that would not be on the sort of geographical regions that we understand at present—being operated and administered at a regional or provincial level. There may be wider and more important matters to give to regional authorities if we set them up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) asked me if I would give an undertaking to say something further on Report. By the time I sit down I shall have said all that there is to say, from the Government's point of view, until Crowther reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston upon
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>194</span>
Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson) made a very interesting contribution. He pointed out that in so many activities there is a regional outlook—in sport and so on. This shows that the public would accept some regional outlook in government. This is what we are trying to provide by setting Regional Economic Planning Councils to join with Regional Standing Conferences of local planning authorities in producing Regional Strategic Plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall) raised the point of county names. He asked what would happen to the name "Yorkshire" or to Yorkshire loyalties now that it was split between several counties. For many years Yorkshire has been divided into separate counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth mentioning that in the Bill we are creating new counties for statutory purposes. They are not binding for any other purpose, and if people still wish to refer to the traditional counties they are at liberty to do so, as has happened in the case of Middlesex. It would be inconvenient if small areas, transferred from one county to another, continued to be known for official purposes as part of the county from which they have been transferred. But when one has the traditional counties wholly within a new county, I see no reason why the names should not be preserved for many purposes, if not for the statutory official purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely Cumberland, Westmorland, Hereford, Huntingdon, the Isle of Ely, the Isle of Wight, Rutland, Peterborough and Worcestershire can be retained for sporting, cultural or other purposes if the people wish. Where it is the other way round and several counties are embodied in one traditional county such as Yorkshire, we can still retain that for many purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the speech of the right hon. Member for Deptford. He said that we are unanimous that there should be some buffer authority between central and local government. Whether it is an elected body or an appointed body, how it comes into being and who the personnel will be remains to be decided. We recognise the principle that people like to look at things from a regional point of view in many instances, and this is of great value in considering economic growth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman put a practical point about timing. I accept that the words
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>195</span>
which I quoted from the Leader of the Opposition's speech which he made in 1968 were used at a time different from that of the present. But I think the same principles apply and that we can get on with local government reorganisation without waiting for recommendations which may be made about the type of regional or provincial authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman complained that I had not given a suitable alternative. Surely it would be foolish for a Minister to give an alternative to the present form of regional administration without seeing the report of a Commission which is now deliberating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the hypothetical questions which the right hon. Gentleman asked me, let me try to hypothecate. The right hon. Gentleman asked whether, if Crow-ther reported in favour of provincial councils during the period of the passage of this Bill, we would include these in the Bill. It would be extremely difficult to redraft a Bill of this size and to ask the House to consider it again on the basis of some other tier of government to be inserted. Whatever Crowther reports, none of us would be prepared to take away responsibility for large chunks of local government services and give it to a regional body. I think we are dealing more with delegation from the top rather than pulling out services from the bottom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that if we tried to put any recommendations of Crowther in this Bill we would need to create an entirely new structure, and I am sure that would not be acceptable to the House at the stage that we should have reached by the time Crowther reports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can we believe in the sincerity of what the Minister is saying if he is saying, on the one hand, that it is impossible for the Government to prejudge Crowther and we must wait for the Crowther Report, and, on the other hand, that if Crowther recommends that responsibility for many services should go from local government, nobody could possibly accept it? The Minister is both prejudging the Crowther Report and waiting for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prejudging it only to the extent which Crowther himself did in reporting to the Government. I have on a previous occasion quoted what Lord Crowther has said to the Govern-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
ment, which is, in fact, quoted in the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pass to the second hypothetical question—or was it hypothetical?—which the right hon. Member for Deptford asked me. He said that I had suggested that the present structure was an interim structure, which rather led one to believe that I was anticipating some development of the interim structure. I do not want to be held to that. It is merely a business-like structure which is giving recognition to a egional outlook, and we have tried to put it in a business-like form without prejudicing the future and to hold the position to ensure that those we put in a regional capacity are doing a good job of work or have a good job of work to do, until we can decide, on the basis of the Crowther report, the right structure to set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, because there is no vital dispute between us on the principle behind the Amendment, hon. Gentlemen opposite will accept the advice of the right hon. Member for Deptford and will leave this subject open for continuing debate, as it must be, for some months to come. In saying that, I do not give an undertaking that anything further will be introduced into the Bill at a later date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I would have to reserve the position if Crowther reported, say, before the Report stage, because we would, I think, have to discuss the matter on Report. I trust that the Minister has that point in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman would wish to discuss it then. I propose to give no undertaking about it. At the same time, what I was saying about not necessarily coming to a final decision in this Committee was a matter of courtesy to the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made it clear that there is a fundamental difference of opinion on a matter of principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side of the Committee have put forward consistent, useful contributions in a constructive way, complying with the principle of provincial councils outlined not only in the majority Redcliffe-Maud Report but in the minority Senior report. The Minister has accepted that there was a good deal of common sense in what we were saying. However, he is now saying that, whatever Crowther recommends, he will not implement any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>197</span>
of the recommendations about provincial councils. He is closing the book. But, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) rightly pointed out, the Minister is using the report for other purposes, saying, "I cannot answer now. I am waiting for the report".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One would have thought that the silence of hon. Members opposite indicated that there were no problems in their areas. The probable reason for it is that they have little experience of local government. Perhaps no one is writing to them, but we on this side of the Committee are inundated with requests from authorities up and down the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the question of the meaningfulness of a provincial council. It shall be a body responsible to an area which is large enough in order to plan strategically—not to prepare structural and detailed plans—matters of communication, the general economy of the area, the economic problems, and even primary problems and investment problems, in such a way that the unitary authorities and the metropolitan authorities within the province can carry out in a sensible and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>198</span>
rational way their structural plans for their own areas. There is logic in the proposition of a hierarchy of local authorities, provincial council, unitary authority and metropolitan boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, up to a few moments ago we had been led to believe that the Minister was prepared to look at Crowther. This made us realise how nonsensical it would be at this stage of the Bill to make decisions on the counties. This is what worries us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we are worried about a different position from which the Minister says he is immovable. The Crowther Commission might as well stop deliberating. What is the Crowther Commission sitting for? The Government's new thinking has not come out of the blue, but it has been kept in the dark and we have not been told about it. However, I imagine that the Government have known all along that the Crowther Commission has been wasting its time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
