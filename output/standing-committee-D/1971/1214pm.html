	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL</h1></div>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be convenient, and give hope and expectation to members of the Committee, if I say that I propose to suspend the Sitting at 7.15 and resume at 8.30 p.m.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David James</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Would it be possible for us to have more fresh air in the room? It is very hot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will have that attended to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. With regard to your announcement Sir Stephen, it appears that we shall be sitting well after 8.30 this evening. It may become a habit which the Committee will not enjoy. It prevents Members from attending debates in the House and, because there is no means of informing members of a Committee that a Division is taking place in the Committee room would it not be possible to make arrangements for some Members of the Committee to take part in debates in the House while the Committee is sitting? If that suggestion were agreed to, in the first place the quorum of the Committee would have to be lowered. Secondly, the time between the declaration of a Division in the Committee and the time that it is actually taken would have to be extended from whatever period it is at present to say, four to six minutes. Thirdly, there would have to be some way of informing Members in the Chamber that a Division had been called in a particular Committee room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To take those points seriatim as far as the quorum is concerned, it is laid down in Standing Orders. I have to operate the Standing Orders and, therefore, nothing can be done about it. Secondly, as far as the notification of Divisions is concerned, it was considered
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>
by the Services Committee who came to an arrangement with regard to the Committee stage of the Finance Bill. So far, they have not come to a decision with regard to other Committees of the House. Until they do I have to carry out existing orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point concerning the length of time between the announcement of a Division and the locking of doors is a matter within my unfettered discretion. I can allow a considerable time to elapse before the locks are actually locked. I make it a practice to consult at least one member of the Committee to ensure that the time is appropriate to announce the locking of doors. I try to get it through as quickly as I can, but if a general wish is represented to me through the proper channels that longer time should be given before ordering the locking of doors I shall attend to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. I am glad the point has been raised. Some of us were put in a difficult position last week in that we wished to attend urgent debates in the Chamber; yet there were problems here which also needed our attention. I should be glad, therefore, if it would be possible to speed up the transmission of the notification of Divisions in Committee to Members attending debates in the Chamber.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall see that the matter is brought to the attention of the Services Committee, although I cannot guarantee that Committee's prompt attention to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Stephen. I recollect that during the proceedings on the Finance Bill earlier this year, Divisions were called, not only in the Committee corridor, but elsewhere in the building. Is it possible for that practice to be repeated in the case of this Committee, without reference to the Services Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly inquire into that possibility. I was in the Chair during part of the Committee stage of the Finance Bill, and I remember that those arrangements were made. I shall inquire whether something can be done in this respect outside the instructions of the Services Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment No. 205 proposed</i>â€”(	<i>this day</i>) in, page 181, line 13, column 2, leave out 'and Tyldesley' and insert 'Tyldesley and Westhoughton'.</p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the conclusion of this morning's Sitting, I was discussing the intransigence and inflexibility of the Under-Secretary with regard to the Amendments tabled in connection with the Greater Manchester area. As we have heard from hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, all these Amendments have the considerable, sometimes overwhelming and unanimous, support of the areas concerned. For example, Amendment No. 211, relating to Bury and Rochdale, had the support of the hon. Member for Bury and Radcliffe (Mr. Fidler) and of my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale (Mr. McCann), both of whom on Second Reading spoke in effect to that Amendment. Yet the Under-Secretary is not prepared to give an inch on any of the Amendments, or even to guarantee that he will consider the matter between now and Report with a view to making some slight Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen will be aware, from the volume of correspondence received on this question, that the Amendments are of vital importance to the people in the areas concerned. They are not matters of life and death, or make and break for the Bill. Therefore, why cannot the Under-Secretary and the Government make some small concessions? The Under-Secretary criticised the Committee this morning for the length of time spent on these proceedings. If this is to be the attitude of the Government to the most minor Amendments put forward throughout the Schedule we shall be here for a very considerable length of time. Hon. Gentlemen on both sides cannot but wonder when they see that no impression is made upon the Governmentâ€”not the slightest dint in their armour, despite the arguments deployedâ€”whether they have made their case at sufficient length and with sufficient vigour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>424</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Michael Heseltine)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must be aware that the Government have shown immense flexibility on the points we have been discussing and have made change after change in the proposals published in the White Paper in May. Yet today the Opposition have occupied the Committee's time in trying to persuade us to reinsert the changes over which we have been so flexible. Thus it is unreasonable of the hon. Member to suggest that we have not been flexible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactlyâ€”there is no flexibility in the Government's attitude to the House and to the Committee. In addition, the views being expressed in this Committee for the most part represent almost entirely the views of the local areas concerned, finding expression either through their Members or via members of the Committee, because this debate is not, as it should be, taking place on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Farnworih (Mr. Roper) raised what I consider to be the very minor matter of two wards of Golborneâ€”Culcheth Ward and Newchurch Ward. Surely in this instance, where the two wards and the local authority concerned wish to go as a whole into the Wigan area, the Under-Secretary and the Minister of State could agree to re-examine the situation. It seems strange to divide an urban district in this way, against the wishes of the inhabitants. Yet the Government will not even consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Living in the area concerned, I am amazed when the Under-Secretary describes the Culcheth area of Golborne as a rural area. There is nothing rural about this area. It is comparatively more rural than the rest of Golborne. However, that is all that one could say about this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth will deal with that at much greater length, but it exemplifies a small point which the Under-Secretary refuses to take into account, despite the arguments advanced by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, hon. Members on both sides spoke to the Amendment dealing with Turton and Bolton. The hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed), and my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>425</span>
Farnworth, who both know a great deal about this matter, in unison across the Committee pressed the Amendment relating to a comparatively small area with a small population. Acceptance of the Amendment would not do a great deal of harm to other local government areas or to the structure of the Bill. Nevertheless, the Under-Secretary will not even say that he will look at the matter again. He will not say that he will consider our arguments with a view to his tabling possible Amendments on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to what I consider to be the major Amendment. This concerns two very well known county boroughsâ€”the county borough of Rochdale and the county borough of Bury. Both of them are being forced to merge against their wishes into a new metropolitan area. As I said previously, hon. Members representing both those constituenciesâ€”this was acknowledged by the Under-Secretary as regards the hon. Member for Bury and Radcliffe, my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale feels no less strongly on this matterâ€”have made continual representations affecting their constituencies asking for a change under the Bill. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee spoke to this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Under-Secretary gave a very full and detailed replyâ€”it certainly was not skirmishing the situation; he had obviously looked into the positionâ€”nevertheless, when there is such a weight of local opinion from the areas and councils concerned, spoken to by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, one would think that the Government could look at the matter again. I still do not despair of the Under-Secretary's saying to the Committee that he will have another look at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary mentioned that he had flown over this area. That is not the way to examine local government structures. As one of my hon. Friends said, most of our constituents do not fly from Bury to Rochdale in aeroplanes. They go on the ground. They know that these two towns are entirely different. They are different areas. They are different boroughs. They have different traditions. They are friendly boroughs, but they are different boroughs. There is a ridge of high land between the two boroughs which would be the centre of the new metropolitan area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to take up something that
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) said with regard to maps. I did not realise what a disadvantage it was for hon. Members not to have Ordnance Survey maps until I came to move my Amendment. The maps which the Government have put before the Committee are on much too small a scale for the detailed Amendments which we are considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Worse still, there is no relief on those maps. When dealing with areas such as the moorland area around Bolton and the area between Rochdale and Bury it is important for hon. Members to be able to see on a relief map exactly what others are talking about when they say that there is a complete separation between these two areas. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth is reduced to bringing a tea towel before the Committee to illustrate what he is talking about with regard to Turton because not sufficient maps are available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State said that it would be a costly business to provide each Member of the Committee with an Ordnance Survey map of the area concerned. I think that any Member of the Committee who wants an Ordnance Survey map, even though he applies for it on a green form at the Vote Office, ought to be able to obtain one. The cost of providing every member of the Committee with 1-inch Ordnance Survey maps of the areas concerned would be a fraction of the cost of flying an aeroplane over England to describe to the Under-Secretary the local government areas beneath.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman agree that a sensible compromise would be to have on the Table a supply of Ordnance Survey maps which could be borrowed by Members as appropriate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to take them home, but they should be available for hon. Members to look at. I do not know the exact price, but I think that they are 40p each. That is the kind of figure we are talking about for Members of a Committee considering the important matter of restructuring local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary gave a full reply to the arguments which I and some of my hon. Friends and hon. Gentlemen opposite advanced, but I do not think that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
he has come to grips with the real issue, which is community of interests and the wishes of the people concerned. I referred to the union of Bury and Rochdale as a shotgun marriage. That is what it could be. We have proposed a viable alternative. Admittedly, the populations at present would be lower than those recommended in the White Paper, but, as I pointed out earlier, the populations projected for 1981 and 1991 come very close to the kind of figure proposed for areas in the Government's White Paper more than 200,000 and close to a quarter of a million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the Amendments are not perfect. I merely seek some sign from the Government that they will at least look, at the Amendment regarding Bury and Rochdale, for the populations of both towns are against the Government. Both populations want something entirely different from what is proposed in the Bill, and by the expressions of voices all round the Committee it seems that hon. Members endorse that view. I ask the Under-Secretary to look at this proposal again and not to be so intransigent. Some of the Amendments are important, some are minor, but if this inflexibility continues, we shall be considering this Schedule for a long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Fitch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found the Minister's reply to Amendment No. 205 disappointing. 	<i>District b,</i> Bolton district, has an estimated population of a quarter of a million, and taking the Westhoughton population of 17,000 out of that would obviously reduce it. Equally, Wigan district has an estimated population of 300,000, which would add to it. But such arguments are not valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's second objection to the transfer was that there was a common boundary between Westhoughton and Bolton. That, too, I do not dispute. But I am concerned not so much about the facts which the Minister has quoted in his favour as about the things which he has left out. The first is that Westhoughton Urban District Council unanimously supports the proposal to go into 	<i>District a,</i> the Wigan district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) made an interesting speech this morning when he
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
concisely described what he called community interests. He mentioned four. Here, again, the Minister has ignored the community interests between Westhoughton and the proposed district of Wigan. I know a little about the Culcheth-New-church wards because I lived in Culcheth for 15 years and travelled regularly to Leigh. I assure the Minister that the community of interests between Culcheth, Newchurch and Leigh are far greater than those between the two wards concerned and Warrington, but he has ignored them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not quarrel with the Minister about it, but I found his praise for the Member for Bury and Radcliffe (Mr. Fidler) a fulsome eulogy. But praise is also due to my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale (Mr. McCann) who has worked extremely hard and diligently and taken a great interest in the Amendment of the hon. Member for Bury and Radcliffe. In the same non-partisan spirit displayed by the Minister, I add my thanks to the hon. Member for Rochdale for his interest in the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee for long but, like other hon. Members, I was disappointed by the reply of the Under-Secretary. However, on consideration I understand why he felt it necessary to give a clear answer at this stage rather than to say that he would consider the matter and return to it on Report: decisions have to be taken, the new authorities have to start setting themselves up; and it would be unsatisfactory if matters were left unsettled for two or three months. It is important that the Committee should come to a conclusion this evening, although I hope that before we do so the Minister will take into account one or two of the observations which I will now make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discussing Westhoughton and the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. Fitch), the Minister spoke of the fact that the Westhoughton council came out unanimously in favour of going into Wigan. He attributed that decision to the fact that local councillors thought that they would have more influence if they were in Wigan. It seems to be thought that if a local council is against the views of the Government, it is for the ulterior motive that councillors will have more influence. On the other hand, if by chance a local council comes out in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>429</span>
favour of the Government's views, there seems to be an overwhelming argument for accepting the Minister's views. We cannot accept that argument one way or the other, because the Minister seems to play alternately as it suits the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the views of my hon. Friends the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) and the Member for Wigan, the case for Newchurch and Culcheth seems much stronger than that made by the Minister, particularly because of the Golborne Urban District Council. I hope that the Minister will not agree that this is an instance where we should not disturb an urban district council before local government reorganisation. If there is a case for believing that Golborne looks towards Risley, that is something with which the Boundary Commission can deal subsequently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 255 deals with the three parishes in the Wigan rural district. The Minister made some valid comments about that and I do not feel it necessary to press that Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to an intervention from the hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed), the Under-Secretary agreed that he had undertaken a Judgment of Solomon which was never executed, I trust that he will agree that it should be a Judgment of Solomon and not be executed on this occasion. He said that the parts of Turton which he had excluded were the areas with small populations, small villages. Because only a few people are concerned is no reason to forget their interests. It is clear from the evidence from the Belmont community that its links with Bolton should remain. The Turton Urban District Council does not want to be split up but to be completely in the conurbation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary referred to these villages as being remote and isolated. If he looks at the map of the conurbation, he will find a whole host of other villages with exactly the same character which are included in the conurbation. One could cite the villages of Norden, of Whitworth, Wardle, Milnrow, all villages in the Saddleworth Urban District Council. One could spend a long time pointing out the similarity of characteristics which the hon. Gentleman included with the villages which he has excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that he will accept the views of both the hon. Member for Bolton, East
	<span class='label label-info column'>430</span>
and of those of us who know the district and agree that the whole of the Turton Urban District Council should be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talked about 	<i>ad hoc</i> arrangements being made if there were difficulties about the way in which the boundaries had been drawn. But that is not good enough. We want to get the right boundaries, not boundaries which will need an infinity of new 	<i>ad hoc</i> arrangements. We all know how unsatisfactory 	<i>ad hoc</i> arrangements are in local governmentâ€”more committees, joint committees of one sort and another, all taking up a lot of time of officials and councillors. To say that we can set up 	<i>ad hoc</i> arrangements to deal with this is not at all a satisfactory answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I turn to the Amendments affecting Disley and Glossop. I repeat that Cheshire County Council, when it submitted its memorandum on the Secretary of State's original proposals, did not suggest that Disley should be removed from the Greater Manchester conurbation; it could see no case for doing so. It put in Ellesmere Port, Wilmslow, Alderley Edge, even Poynton, but it did not mention Disley, because it realised that it would be ludicrous that it should be removed from the conurbation. In this instance the Minister should think again. Similarly, it is true that Glossop is an independent town, but so are many of the towns in the existing conurbation boundaries, town such as those surrounding Rochdale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities such as Glossop, Alderley Edge, Disley, and Turton, which have seen their populations increase over the last decade by 40, 50, or 58 per cent., have demonstrated that they are becoming areas more closely linked with the conurbation. I therefore hope that before it is too lateâ€”I accept that we should make a decision on these matters tonightâ€”the Under-Secretary will give us rather more encouragement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My intervention, you will be delighted to hear, Sir Stephen, will be blessedly short. As I said earlier, I had originally no intention of intervening in this debate. But the more I listened to the arguments, the more I felt that there was some substance in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that I did not go all the way with my hon. Friend the Member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>431</span>
for Wigan (Mr. Fitch), even though I thought that he argued his case persuasively. But I join him in his tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale (Mr. McCann). My hon. Friend has nagged me, as much as, I gather, the hon. Member for Bury and Radcliffe (Mr. Fidler) has nagged the Under-Secretary, which is what a Member of Parliament should be doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendments in the names of my hon. Friends the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) and the Member for Farn-worth (Mr. Roper) raised issues of a wider importance and a greater substance. I understand the Under-Secretary's dilemma. He says, "What we are being asked to do is, to some extent, to put back what we took out. Therefore, we are flexible. Therefore, please do not worry us any more". On the other hand, I am sure, listening, as he must have done, as closely and attentively as I did to my hon. Friend, that there were a number of considerations that were absolutely new and of great importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the Under-Secretary that he thinks about it and does not close his mind totally between now and Report. I hope that this matter will be raised again on Report. If, on the other hand, the Under-Secretary feels he cannot do that, and if my hon. Friends decide to divide, speaking as a witness to the points made, I for one would support them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be my last wish to appear in any way discourteous to the Committee by not answering as fully as possible. One of the principal difficulties when discussing local government boundaries is that one can often rehearse the arguments but not convince, and in the end a judgment must be made. Thus, I do not think that it would be helpful to take up the Committee's time by repeating arguments which I have already made and which appear to the Government to strike a balance in the final decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Government have tried genuinely to listen to the representations made to them. Indeed, the criticism might be levelled that we would have been better employed in not giving way on the representations until the Committee stage when we could have made many concessions. While that would have been an attractive political stance for us
	<span class='label label-info column'>432</span>
to take, it would not have been wise for local government because local authorities are getting on with the job of bringing about the new framework of local government reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not that mean that I was correct when I suggested earlier today that the Government had made up their minds, that they will not budge from their decisions, in which case the whole of the Committee stage is a charade?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not the case. As the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) rightly pointed out, however much one wants to take the decisions, of course there still remain the difficult, the marginal and finely balanced situations. There will certainly be occasions when we shall, I hope, be able to accept Amendments to the Schedule. It would, be unrealistic, however, to pretend that we can meet the majority, or even a substantial minority, of the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It so happens that the first group of Amendments does not include areas for which proposals could be accepted. However, if we make progress tonight, I have in mind one or two Amendments which could possibly turn the whole balance of the argument put forward by Opposition Members. The essence of the argument is whether anything new can be produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing that interested me during our consultations was that many local authorities quoted time after time when they had all met together to rehearse the very arguments they were about to put to me. These are long-standing local arguments, frequently resurrected, quite understandably, so that it is difficult to find new considerations in these issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the most controversial Amendment relates to the Bury-Rochdale question. On a personal note, I had absolutely no intention of appearing discourteous to the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. McCann). It is understandable that, by the very nature of party politics, he should work through his right hon. Friend while my hon. Friend the Member for Bury and Radcliffe (Mr. Fidler) should more frequently come to Ministers. It is nevertheless the case, even in Bury-Rochdale, that the joint committee of the authorities now exists and has met. Discussions have already taken place about how the new framework will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>433</span>
come into being. This has happened only recently, but moves are already under way to bring about the new framework which is envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tried wherever possible to be helpful. I understand that we have made concessions in respect of 60 individual cases between the publication of the Consultative Document and the Bill. It is certainly not true to say, as the hon. Member for Farnworth suggested, that we used the argument about local authorities agreeing or disagreeing with us in whichever way happened to suit our book. Where local authorities have disagreed with us, we have listened and sometimes given way to their arguments. Indeed, the fact that we gave way so frequently makes it that much more difficult for me to do so in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can follow the final, and I thought most genuine, observation of the hon. Member for Farnworth that decisions must be taken tonight. I hope that the Committee is satisfied. I thank the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) for his generous tribute to my reply. We have tried to look at all the arguments fairly and dispassionately and we have had to take difficult, but I hope conclusive, decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary's reply was monstrous. We all pay tribute to what he has done to take soundings among authorities to reach the best possible conclusion on the best advice he could get; that goes without saying. However, he is now telling us both where he intends to stand firm and where he intends to give way, and he says that in either case the Government have made up their minds and that nothing will move them. That is not good enough, and my right hon. Friend's comment that the proceedings are a complete charade is fully justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By saying the Government will not give way on some things, but will give way on others, decided before the debate, the Under-Secretary puts us in an impossible position. I beg the Minister and the Under-Secretary to show some semblance of courtesy for the Committee. They should be prepared to listen to the arguments and if those arguments are compelling, they should undertake to reconsider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we have the wrong impression and that the Under-Secretary
	<span class='label label-info column'>434</span>
will say so. If everything has been cut and dried before the debate in Committee has even commenced, it is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) has put a most unfair interpretation on what I have been saying. Many of his hon. Friends have paid tribute to the efforts that the Government are making to help and to look at the facts as they are. The hon. Member for Small Heath was in the Labour Government and he knows how the procedures work. When we consider Committee debates and Amendments it is perfectly legitimate to feel that there are issues which we can look at again in the light of all the arguments which we have heard many times, believing that nothing new will come up, that we have heard all the arguments and reached a decision one way or the other because representations have already been made to us over the considerable period of local government reorganisation. However, there were areas about which we were not certain, and if hon. Members opposite question these areas, we are disposed to listen favourably to what they have to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly right that my hon. Friend the Minister of State and I should know of some areas where we want to help more than others: that must be the case. The hon. Member, who has done similar work on behalf of that Labour Government, knows full well that if as a member of the Government, I give the kind,of assurances I have given, they are not given lightly, and one is trying to help. It is to the credit of all hon Members who spoke before the hon. Member for Small Heath that they understand that we are trying to help, and have not made similar unfortunate interventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Daniel Awdry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put a plea to hon. Members opposite not to lose their tempers at this stage of the Bill? It is difficult for hon. Members such as myself, who do not know the area in question, to discuss areas such as Widnes and Wigan. We have listened to the debates with our minds as open as possible. We come to the Committee because we intend to improve the face of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A pattern seems to be developing. Two
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0243">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>435</span>
or three speakers speak to various Amendments. The Minister gives the best answers he can, and then the hon. Members say that the answers are totally unsatisfactory. If we assume at the start that the Minister has not the slightest intention of meeting any arguments, it will be a charade. It is unfair for hon. Members to suggest that that is the attitude of the Government. If it were, we should be wasting our time. It is unfair to speak as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) has spoken, on this the first Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we continue in the right spirit, we may make progress, but if we start to fall out on the first Amendment, we shall have an unpleasant time on matters which are not strictly party political. Where to draw the line in any area must be a matter of judgment, not of party politics. We should get on better if we approached it in that spirit. The Under-Secretary has said that he will meet us all, where he can. That is a perfectly reasonable attitude, and if the Committee adopts it, we shall make good progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of Amendment No. 27 is to insert Hampshire into the list of non-metropolitan counties. This is so for a number of reasons. However, it may be of assistance to the Committee, Sir Stephen, if, before I give the general reasons, I were to take the Committee briefly through the proposed metropolitan districts and what the effect would be on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>District a</i> would be the administrative county of the Isle of Wight. It is interesting to note that at the moment this is a county in its own right, but under the Bill as it stands it would totally disappear. I may be wrong, but I think it is the only county to lose its existence entirely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a part of Hampshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is quite right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The status of the Isle of Wight is interesting. It has a fairly vigorous authority at the moment. What exactly it intends to do, or whether its views are the same as the Amendment, I do not know. But this would preserve for it the right of decision-making in its own right in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0245">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>439</span>
local government. Having said that, I think that will be sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The County Borough of Portsmouth, which would be 	<i>District b</i> under the Amendment, is a totally different consideration. Here is an authority which is already of considerable importance, and very large numerically, and is an authority which will lose not only for itself but for the rest of the Hampshire area a considerable amount of the advantages it already possessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said on Second Reading that it was my view, and the view of my party, that a metropolitan county should be the authority that dealt with education. However, I understood the reasons why there were those who believed that education should be with metropolitan districts. Indeed, the original Maud Report put that forward as the basis on which education should be dealt with in local government. There are many representatives on all sides of the political spectrum who adopt the same point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were ever to make a case for education being with the metropolitan district, it would certainly be with something like the metropolitan district of Portsmouth, and for this reason. It is at the moment an extremely able and powerful education authority. It has already justified itself in what I regard as one of the major points in favour of metropolitan county level education, namely the way in which it deals with the minority pupils. For example, it has built a large number of special schools for handicapped pupils. It copes with them extremely well. The buildings in which it teaches them are themselves modern. I believe that by next year every single one of the authority's special schools will be post-war. That is a tremendous achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has a college of education with 1,000 trainee teachers which has an authority and prestige well known beyond its own area. It has a polytechnic with about 4,000 full time students, and that polytechnic is still building. That is the kind of area we are talking about. It has a technical college, a college of design and art, not merely known throughout a wide area but also catering for a large number of people outside the immediate area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the situation with regard to education. If the Minister believes, as he
	<span class='label label-info column'>440</span>
must since this is the basis in education of his Bill, that education ought to be at a metropolitan district level, I wonder whether he could find anywhere in England and Wales other than areas like Portsmouthâ€”Southampton is another, I shall come to that in a momentâ€”where a better case could be made for education being at a metropolitan district council level. It would be very difficult to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is not only in education that one must consider the contribution which Portsmouth has made in local government. Its social services have been established now for a number of years. I believe that in the last six years the children's department has trebled its resources. It has an enviable record in family aids and houses for homeless families. It has flats for unsupported mothers, play groups and rent guarantee schemes. In an age which has at last begun to do something about and realise the essential importance of providing mental health service, it has an extremely good one. It has purpose-built day nurseries with special facilities for handicapped children. It has services for the elderly and handicapped. It has replied positively to Seebohm. It has a new department of social services with a staff of 1,200 and a Â£2 million budget. As I have said, if anything lends itself to the idea of a metropolitan district council, this must be it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus Portsmouth. But, of course, Portsmouth also is not the end. The next district council we should like to see established would be the present County Borough of Southampton. It too has an enviable record in education. If one takes its natural area of density, it also has a population today of about 450,000 people which will probably rise to about 600,000 within the next 10 or 20 years. That is not the present county borough area, but an area of natural identity, a contiguous areaâ€”a community of interest, as we said on an earlier Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is Southampton. It has a university, a college of education, a college of technology and a school of education. Again, is any area in this country more suitable as a metropolitan district than the metropolitan district which we are proposing of Southampton and the neighbouring places? It is interesting to note that there is no dissent in either Portsmouth or Southamptonâ€”I deliber-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>441</span>
ately omit the Isle of Wightâ€”on the question whether they should form a metropolitan district and whether Hampshire should be a metropolitan county. They both agree. It is remarkable that it should be so, and that it should be felt so strongly and passionately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, as with other Amendments, the Under-Secretary had taken the view that he has talked the matter over locally and is impressed with what has been said, and that therefore what is said in Committee is not of so much importance, it is surprising that I should be moving the Amendment and not the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said that I shall deal with the various districts one by one. I concede straightaway that 	<i>District</i> (	<i>d</i>) has its difficulties; it tends to straggle, and there is a degree of built-up area within it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary will probably concede that Aldershot and Basingstoke could be described as built-up areas. To a lesser degree, Alton and Farnborough could also be so described. Although the case is not as strong as it is for Portsmouth and Southampton, it is a viable district, containing a population of 431,000. If that is so it means that we have an easily divisible metropolitan county. We have the Isle of Wight, with its existing local authority connections; the two major areas of Portsmouth and Southampton; and 	<i>District</i> (	<i>d</i>), with its population of 431,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can see the difficulties concerning Hampshire. At the moment it is the Texas of Englandâ€”although I do not suppose that much oil is produced in the area. It is a very large area, with a population which within a measureable time will number about 2 million. To make it into a non-metropolitan county is to get the worst of all worlds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote from the 	<i>Southern Evening Echo</i> of 16th November. That newspaper is normally very friendly to the Government and the party it represents. On the whole, as one would expect, it tends to sympathise with the work of the Government, and with the Local Government Bill. It had this to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government are on the verge of a major mistake with their otherwise commendable efforts to modernise and reform local Government. Their new Hampshire is too big for one county authority to handle â€¦"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>442</span>
This is a cumbersome giant. It would be the country's largest county, an unwieldy conglomeration wrapping up rural and urban interests with Southampton, Portsmouth and across the sea to the Isle of Wight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, more succinctly, perhaps more clearly, is the case that I was trying to make this afternoon. But it states what are the difficulties in the present non-metropolitan county. It is an area that is, at the moment, too diverse. It is an area in which there are two large and growing urban communitiesâ€”growing foreseeably in population, and indeed, moving one towards the other. It is inevitably an area in which this will be the important weight of life inside the area as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned education. This also is a vital question, and one that is not being dealt with properly under a non-metropolitan county authority. It is not dealt with because what will have to be taken back, as it were, is what has already been achieved in Portsmouth and Southampton. I have tried to draw the Committee's attention to what has been going on during the past 10 years, and it is of tremendous importance in education in both Portsmouth and Southampton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This work will not be totally destroyed, but obviously a great deal will be lost, if what exists at the moment is simply lumped into a county whichâ€”I will not say that it has a terrible education record; that would be unfair and quite wrongâ€”is so large and wide that it cannot possibly have the advantages that exist already in a compact metropolitan area. That is where the difficulty lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we stick to the present idea of a non-metropolitan county, education is likely to sufferâ€”not permanently; perhaps in another 10 or 12 years' time education authorities will have become assimilated and there may be advantages in it. But I am concerned about the next 12 years, and I am concerned that the good start that has been made in post-war education in those two areas will tend to decline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This, basically, is the point that I want to make. We have a chance, it seems to me, at this moment, of thinking again on something of importance, of saying that since both parties are in agreement on this, there can be no question of any party advantage or any accusation of party advantage. It is purely a question of administrative advantage. Here all local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>443</span>
opinion is strongly in favour of the metropolitan county, certainly if one takes it in population. At the same time, the administrative advantages are taking the best of what already exists and building it up into a new structure, rather than starting afresh on so many grounds. All these things count very much in favour of creating a metropolitan county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is the one untidy district, 	<i>District</i> (	<i>d</i>), but having said that, in population this can take its place with any metropolitan district in the country, in size and in scope. One must remember about 	<i>District</i> (	<i>d</i>), too, that like the rest of this area this must be one of the fastest growing areas in potential population and in what it can achieve, and with an importance in industry, in the whole of this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For these reasons I beg the Minister to think again. Let him re-read his own words of an Amendment or two ago. Let him say, "I have consulted local opinion, and local opinion in the majority is in favour of such a metropolitan county." Accordingly, this is the moment at which one of those concessions that all of us on this Committee have been promised ought to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what my right hon. Friend has said. We have travelled from one part of the country to another, but this is a part of the country that I only know as a holiday visitor. Britain is fortunate in having some areas that cannot be fitted into a mould or patternâ€”and this is one of them. My right hon. Friend referred to this as the Texas of England, probably thinking of its growth in population. A more parallel American analogy would be "the California of England," because it comprises two of the greatest ports in the countryâ€”Portsmouth and Southamptonâ€”the beautiful rural countryside of Winchester and the surrounding areas, and the holiday resort of the Isle of Wight. All these places are to be contained in one county. I do not think that the mixture will work. The Amendment seeks to give metropolitan district status to the four very different component parts of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With some justification hon. Gentlemen opposite have said that the adoption of the unitary system throughout the country would not work. They may well be right. To force all areas into a unitary
	<span class='label label-info column'>444</span>
system would be a distortion of local government. But it is just as much a distortion of local government to put into a county set-up areas that clearly do not fit into that set-up. Certainly three of the metropolitan districts proposed in the Amendment by no means fit into any two-tier structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to both Portsmouth and Southampton. It is significant that both these huge towns are important ports. In terms of local government a port has very different problems from those of a county area. Many of the problems are known only to the local authority concerned, and other councillors on the Hampshire County Council could not be expected to have the detailed knowledge of the intricate local government provisions that must apply to ports, such as port health. My experience is of Liverpool and Manchester and not of Southampton, but I know that a very different local government structure is needed to deal with ports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More important, situated as they are on the English Channel both these ports will certainly grow, possibly to become the two most important ports in this country if we enter the Common Market. The present growth of the Hampshire area is nothing compared to the growth that is likely to be experienced if we enter the Common Market, and that growth will be at the expense of the North-West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point of the proposed area upon which my hon. Friend did not dwell at any length is the Isle of Wight. Clearly this area is a quite exceptional local government area. The hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Woodnutt) made a very forceful Second Reading speech about his island constituency. The important fact is that it is the only island in the British Isles unconnected by land to the mainland that is affected by this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The island of Anglesey is connected by one bridgeâ€”we hope there will be two in the near futureâ€”to the mainland of Wales. The Isles of Scillyâ€”occupying a very small area, both geographically and from the point of view of populationâ€”are very properly excluded from the Bill. Yet the Isle of Wight becomes part of the administrative County of Hampshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember that the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight during Second Reading clearlv described the difficulties which his constituents would experience when seek-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>445</span>
ing the local services administered at county level. They would not have to catch a bus or train, as some hon. Members have complained would be the case in other areas of the country. They would be faced with a journey by boat lasting po.;sibly three quarters of an hour, or one hour. The process of travelling from the island to the administrative capital of the area might possibly involve a day's journey. Yet this is the only case of a county becoming not another county or merging with another county but being reduced in its entirety to a county district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Isle of Wight and Southampton and Portsmouth experience particular problemsâ€”Southampton and Portsmouth because they are ports, the Isle of Wight because it is an island tourist resort. The hon. Member for Blackpool, North (Mr. Miscampbell) during the debate on Second Reading raised this point with regard to Blackpool. For example, responsibility for car-parking becomes a county responsibility. He pointed out the hopelessness of this situation so far as his constituency was concerned. This local government function, particularly in a holiday resort, ought to be administered at a much lower level by the authority concerned. For example, the area concerned experiences seasonal influxes of traffic. Parking fines cannot be dished out as in Central London or in Liverpool and similar areas. Visitors and tourists would be so incensed that they would never visit the resort again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus this area is different from almost any other part of the British Isles. The people in the area know it. I have discussed this question with my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. R. C. Mitchell). He tells me that he has received 1,742 letters from the Southampton area, all of them supporting the proposals which we have put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, West (Mr. Judd), the hon Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Pink) and the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Mr. James Hill) have all lent their names to the Amendment. Clearly, there is strong local feeling that this is a different type of area. Fortunately, there are parts of this country which cannot be fitted into a pattern. This area is the California of Englandâ€”fast-growing,
	<span class='label label-info column'>446</span>
with ports, industry, countryside, as well as an island. Thus, I support my right hon. Friend in this Amendment, and ask the Minister to consider the setting up of a metropolitan county in this area, where each of the constituent parts would quite properly exercise much more power and control over local government services within their immediate vicinity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the point made by several hon. Members concerning the very real interest that has been shown by local Members of Parliament from all parties. The Amendment bears the names of the hon. Member for Portsmouth, West (Mr. Judd), and the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. R. C. Mitchell), and I pay tribute to the representations made to us by my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Mr. James Hill) and my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Pink). I have no doubt that hon. Gentlemen opposite have heard from their colleagues in just the same way as we have, of the real local concern, interest and anxiety about the problems as they affect the aspirations of the people in these areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think everybody would agree that the decision as to what to do with the Hampshire area as it now exists is a difficult one in any framework of local government reorganisation. This explains why Redcliffe-Maud had one proposal, the last Labour Government had another proposal and now our proposal is different yet again. Certainly it is an indication that whenever minds are brought to bear on this problem there are a range of options, and it is difficult to be totally certain how to fit those options into the framework of the national reorganisation of local government. However, I believe that within the framework of the broad concept which we have introduced into the Bill our proposals make sense in the interest of the people living in the Hampshire area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with two points raised by the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin). The first is the question of the size of Hampshire as comprised in our proposals. It is true that it is a large authority and it will consist of 1.46 million people. But this is not of a scale out of accord with other authorities of heavy population. I can list three others by way of example. Kent, for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0249">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>447</span>
example, is very close behind with 1.39 million people, Lancashire has 1.3 million, and Essex 1.13 million. Whilst I accept that Hampshire is large, it is not out of accord with other county authorities which we are creating under our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point the right hon. Member raised deals with the views of local people. I was attracted, in the first instance, to the argument put forward by the right hon. Member that as the local people had been so clear in their views, and as I had used that argument elsewhere in support of the Government's proposals, I should immediately appear to be consistent. The difficulty is when one actually breaks down the figures and looks at the way in which the local people have expressed views or have remained silent as far as the future of Hampshire is concerned. The representatives of the county boroughs of Portsmouth and Southampton, representing a total of 412,000 people, have argued for the proposal of a metropolitan authority in that area. On the other hand, the remaining authorities representing over 1 million people have either opposed it with equal conviction or have remained silent on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one considers the simple argument as to the way in which local opinion has gone, one finds so often that local opinion is substantially split on these issues, and in this particular case, following the concept of reorganisation based on the historic counties, there was an overwhelming objection from the people living in Hampshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I followed the argument of the right hon. Member when he went through the authorities. He dealt with the case where it was strongest from his point of view. There is not the slightest doubtâ€”and it does not need me to add tributeâ€”of the remarkable work that has been done by Portsmouth and Southampton in coping with the growth and in the provision of services that are attendant upon growth over recent years. But one is then taking these two county boroughs and the surrounding areas in the context of the Amendment and pleading the case from those authorities. It is when one moves on to the other two districts that the difficulty of fitting this Amendment into the framework of the Government's pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>448</span>
posals for metropolitan areas becomes difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one moves not to Portsmouth or Southampton but to 	<i>District d,</i> which is the hinterland, the vast remnant area of Hampshire, one sees the difficulties of trying to make a metropolitan district out of what remains of Hampshire when one has removed Portsmouth and Southampton. Distance itself is indicative of the problem. It is 31 miles from Winchester to Aldershot in 	<i>District</i> (	<i>d</i>). It is 18 miles from Southampton to Lymington.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an indication of the scale upon which it would be necessary to organise the metropolitan district. Yet the district functions under the grand concept of the Bill have been allocated where they appeared to us to be organised on a local and more personal level, and one is faced with the conflict, that in order to try to create a metropolitan county in the area, one will have to create districts which do not enable one to allocate to any of those districts the functions which, by definition of the legislation, are to be given to small districts administered within easy reach of those who live within them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That indicates the difficulty with which we are faced, and which is clearly shown in looking back over the problems faced in the earlier proposals for the area. The last Labour Government, although not backed by Redcliffe-Maud who did not advocate a metropolitan district, in looking at Redcliffe-Maud, decided to advocate a metropolitan area for this part of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That Government argued for a metropolitan area with three metropolitan districts, one based on Southampton, one on Portsmouth, and the third on the Isle of Wight, but there was a different and important factor in that scheme. The metropolitan districts in that Labour Government scheme were not education authorities, and the eloquent plea made for the education authorities of Portsmouth and Southampton, with which I agree, would not have been met by his earlier proposals. Those proposals would have made the metropolitan area the education authority, and not the district, and disruption would have ensued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is one of how to deal with the planning of the area. The Labour Party proposals dealt with planning under the metropolitan county concept, and the metropolitan districts which they pro-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>449</span>
posed would have been united within the framework of an authority which could then undertake planning. We have been encouraged to build on that, but giving planning to a larger authority which in our own framework is based upon the concept of a county in that area. The problem was not dealt with by the Redcliffe-Maud proposals which allowed each of two unitary authorities, based on Southampton and Portsmouth, to administer the planning. In our judgment, there is need for coherent planning in the area, and that is one of the arguments for proceeding along the lines we have suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one straggling district which has been mentioned was conceded by the right hon. Member as the major difficulty confronting us in looking at this as a metropolitan area. There is a second major difficulty, the Isle of Wight, where one immediately comes down to population figures of quite a different order from those which we have envisaged in our proposals. The metropolitan district for the Isle of Wight will have only 109,000 people, rather than the quarter of a million which is to be general elsewhere. This presents real difficulties, as hon. Members will accept. It is known that the Government are having discussions at official level, with officials of the Isle of Wight, to see what special arrangements are necessary and can be made within the framework of our administration for them to cope with their own special problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It nevertheless remains our overall conclusion that to try to cater for the problems of Southampton and Portsmouth by adapting them to the framework of a metropolitan county, which is suitable to areas that need to be planned as single entities for planning, transportation and other major servicesâ€”which is why we have created these metropolitan areas in other areasâ€”does not apply in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second great difficulty is that it is not possible, as everyone who has spoken in the debate will agree, to subdivide the metropolitan county of Hampshire into districts which have sufficiently large populations and resources to support the services of education and the personal social services, and which are sufficiently compact to be sensible units for all other local functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst in no way wishing to diminish the quality of argument that the debate
	<span class='label label-info column'>450</span>
produces, I would not feel able to recommend that the Committee should accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has given us a disappointing reply. I begin with the criteria on which he concluded. He told us that the criteria for metropolitan districts require the area to be capable of being planned as a single entity, and that the area cannot be subdivided into districts which are sufficiently large. I presume that in respect of the second he was relying upon the Isle of Wight, but he had already conceded earlier, as everybody else accepts, that the Isle of Wight is a special case, and on geographical grounds it does not matter which criteria one accepts for the establishment of local government patterns. The Isle of Wight will always stick outâ€”not like a sore thumb, since I often go there to enjoy my holidays, but on account of its geographical location and the limitations of its size. Whatever the conclusions reached, the Isle of Wight must always be a special case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that one cannot justify the second of the Under-Secretary's criteria on the basis of the size of the Isle of Wight. I do not think he could, or would, deny that the three other potential district councils in a metropolitan area, Portsmouth, Southampton, and the remainderâ€”I am not sure what we should call thatâ€”would be three geographical areas with a size and population eminently suitable for metropolitan districts. If the Isle of Wight is removed from our thinking for the moment, because of the difficulties, I suggest that the other three areas in the metropolitan council meet the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.0 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of planning I would suggest that there is nothing in the reply to justify the application of the principle that it must be planned as a single entity. There is nothing in what the Under-Secretary had to say to us which suggests for one moment that that principle is capable of abdication in the circumstances before us. I remember the palmy days of the last Labour Government, when we, as Ministers, decided how to tackle the problem in Hampshire, and we were all marched off together with our advisers and officials to a very large operations room over the road. The Under-Secretary has probably been there himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0251">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>451</span>
In the presence of the chief planner, with his pointers, his sticks and so on, we all reached the conclusion that in the South, where there is the major population drift, there are two areas of growth for the whole of the South-East and South put together, if it is intended to make any sense at all out of trying to develop services and populations in the next 50 years. One, not under discussion for the moment, may be described as between here and your own constituency. Sir Stephen, and we shall come to that later. The other is of tremendous importanceâ€”an inescapable conclusion. The only other major growth area in the whole of the South-East and South that made any sense was on the Southampton-Portsmouth axis and the hinterland that lay behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what kind of advice the Minister is now given in the Department, but as a result of that exercise, all who were present on that occasion, be they Ministers or advisers, reached the conclusion that the case for the creation of the metropolitan area was so logically overwhelming that there was no escaping that conclusion. Therefore, when we try to understand the hon. Gentleman's reasoning as to why the case which seemed so irresistible to us is being turned down by the Government, one can only say that one is extremely disappointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In planning the infrastructure of this developing area, which we are told will almost double in population in the next 20 years, what the Government must do and what we must doâ€”and I am glad that there is no party political difference within the main part of the locality, anywayâ€”is to decide, not what is best for the moment in terms of local government, but how we can determine a local government pattern which will cope with such a tremendous growth as the doubling of population in the next 20 yearsâ€”a buildup to a population of 2 million people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot convince myself, and I doubt whether the Minister can convince himself, that the Government's proposals in the Bill are capable of the arrangement of infrastructure, the growth of industry and the growth of population on the scale involved here. I do not believe that the proposals before us for the future local government of that area can possibly sustain that growth. There will be inefficiency and inability to achieve that
	<span class='label label-info column'>452</span>
growth with the harmony which we all desire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was fair that the Under-Secretary should point outâ€”and he is perfectly entitled to do soâ€”that the Redcliffe-Maud Report did not recommend a metropolitan area here. I accept that. Frankly, as Ministers at the time, we were amazed that it did not so recommend, having regard to the logic of its own case. It said that the area was regarded as a "major growth point". It seemed to us that the natural logic of all its arguments was to recommend in this case. But it did not. I accept that. It is fair enough that the hon. Gentleman should say so. But we, in applying the logic of Redcliffe-Maud, reached that conclusion. I am disappointed that the Government, in resisting the Labour Government's proposals, should have departed from that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point which arises from what the Minister has said takes us back to the debate on general principles which we had on Second Reading. The Minister very properly said that the proposals were satisfactory in respect of Portsmouth and Southampton and the people in Portsmouth and Southampton had said that they would support metropolitan areas but the rest of the authority had not. That confirms the case we were making on Second Reading and also with regard to unitary authorities. Wherever there is a conflict of interests, the Government decide it in favour of the counties and against the cities. That is the essence of the matter. The case which was ridiculed by Ministers when we put it forward on Second Reading is now conceded by what the Minister has said here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one excludes the Isle of Wight and takes the three main areas of populationâ€”Portsmouth, Southampton and Winchesterâ€”the government say that Win-lieve that the counties should be placated at the expense of the towns. That is something which we have always suspected and it is confirmed here. I know that Ministers were upset when I said at the end of the Second Reading debate that we could therefore not accept the proposals as a final and permanent solution and that we should reserve the right to return to them again. That position has been justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Very simply, the strength of this country's industrial economy and of its population and environment is based upon the importance of the cities. If one tries to destroy the importance of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>453</span>
cities, one destroys something fundamental to the future importance of this country. That is what Portsmouth and Southampton think the Government are doing to them. They tell us that they have been cities since 1882â€”I think that was the year in which both received their charterâ€”and no one will deny that they have conducted their affairs as efficiently and as progressively as any other two county boroughs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not only the supporting evidence of the letters which my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. R. C. Mitchell) has received, but the letters that we have received from education authorities, teachers' organisations and many social service agencies, which are appalled at the division of responsibility that will result from the implementation of the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been a time-honoured statement in the Committee, and a statement of principle, that we ought not, for instance, to divorce housing from the social services, and that planning should be coherent, as the Minister said. But all these principles are being completely undermined by the situation which the Government have accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are the strongest objections to the proposals of the Government. Southampton and Portsmouth are entitled to have their objections strongly registered in this Committee. I regard this as a test case of the Government's good intentions. I know both Ministers took objection when I said, in a brief intervention at the end of our previous debate, that it seemed to us that the Under-Secretary was saying that he had no intention whatsoever of listening to any word that was said which departed from their preconceived ideas as to where they should hold fast and where they should give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I cannot believe that in the debates we shall have about other parts of the country there will be a more important case for reconsideration of the principles than there is here. Not one hon Member opposite has thought it rieht to intervene in support of the Government's proposals. Not one hon. Member opposite thinks it right to try to justify what the Government are trying to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is overwhelming objection from all the political parties in Portsmouth and Southampton, which make up two
	<span class='label label-info column'>454</span>
out of the three major areas, and whilst I can see that this might disturb people in the Winchester conurbation, not only in functional terms but in terms of local democracy, one would have thought that the solution was to hold to the metropolitan county concept, with metropolitan district councils representing the three major conurbations within the metropolitan county, and acknowledging that the Isle of Wight was a special case which would remain whatever happened and, therefore, had to have special and unique treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the Minister's failure to measure up to the case of Southampton and Portsmouth, and the strong views that they have about the situation, his failure to reassure the Committee about how the doubling of the population and growth of this area in the next 20 years can be managed effectively unless we have a metropolitan county, as Portsmouth and Southampton believe, there is an overwhelming case, not for asking the Minister to accept these Amendments today, which is what we would like, but for saying that a strong case has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There ought to be a re-thinking of the matter. There ought to be further talks with the local authorities in the area. The case of such important cities as Portsmouth and Southampton ought not to be discounted in the manner that it has been discounted in the Committee. I beg the Minister to consider the matter further so that the Amendment can be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do come back because the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) has raised a number of points which are of substance and about which the record needs to be put straight. It is only in the context of so doing that I can make it clear that the points he has raised have been fully considered by us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To deal first of all with the crucial issue of planning which both the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friend raised as being the central problem, to understand the position as we see it, one has to go back to the dilemma that faced the previous Government when considering the Redcliffe-Maud Report, which recommended two unitary authorities based on Portsmouth and Southampton. Faced with the graphic 	<i>tour de force</i> presented to them by officials in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>455</span>
the Department, they were convinced thai separation into two unitary authorities as proposed by Redcliffe-Maud was not in the best interests of the long-term development of that particular area. Therefore, the only way they could overcome the problem was to make the area a metropolitan area and transfer the planning from the unitary authorities to the overall metropolitan authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of our proposal the same solution broadlyâ€”forgetting the boundaries for a secondâ€”has been adopted. We, too, faced first with the Redcliffe-Maud recommendation and then the proposal adopted by the previous Administration, wanted to find a solution for comprehensive planning of this area. Within the framework of our proposal the new counties have got the land use transportation powers. Therefore, the coherence which the hon. Gentleman sought is contained in the division of functions proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oppositions being Oppositions, and having spent far more of my time in opposition than on the Government Front Bench, I sympathise with the temptation. However, I regret that it should be necessary to lapse back into the jargon of local government reformâ€”Second Reading slogans about the conflict of town versus countryâ€”which the hon. Gentleman has once again produced. If he will do his homework on this subject and look at the figures, he will find that there is not the slightest shred of evidence to suggest that the new Hampshire county will be an authority where country dominates town. Indeed, the figures indicate a reverse situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His argument is based entirely upon the assumption that Portsmouth and Southampton are the new metropolitan districts which his Amendment refers to. The fact is that Portsmouth and Southampton represent just under half of the population in the metropolitan districts, so it is not possible to say that they represent a majority. If one were to take the whole of the new county as set out in the Bill, the argument would be even more transparent than in the first example I gave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The urban authorities thorughout the county inside new Hampshire amount to about 600,000 population as opposed to
	<span class='label label-info column'>456</span>
a total population of 412,000 in the two county boroughs. Therefore, the urban contribution to the new Hampshire county which we have already established as about 1.46 million is nearly two-thirds of the population of the new county. It is quite impossible to argue that country will dominate town in the way that has been suggested. We have tried, in getting our new proposals right, to find a balance where all people living in the new county are able to play a part in planning the destiny of that new county, without being obsessed with traditional attitudes to town and country which have beset local authorities for far too long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister in his reply has made me utterly confused. One of the difficulties encountered in the Bill is the lack of a coherent principle behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been listening to the junior Minister saying what to my mind are almost unexceptional things about planning and the necessity of looking at town and country together. They are the very issues which he has denied in other cases. This was the very gravamen of arguments we had earlier when we were told that cities were being purposely looked at in relative isolation because it was thought more suitable to do that and to establish new relationships between urban authorities in many of our big cities and the outlying rural areas. There were many examples all over the country. Yet here we are toldâ€”quite rightly, from the planning point of viewâ€”that we must consider urban and rural communities together. That is what I was arguing earlier. Yet this Government and others have done precisely the opposite in the Northâ€”in Northumberland and the adjacent Tynesideâ€”and the rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not elaborate, but in those areas that attempt to look at the problems together has been denied us, although it has been prayed in aid in this case as essential. The metropolitan solution which has been accepted in the North is being denied here. That is the kind of difficulty that arises when we work entirely by compromise. In my view, the Government have failed to establish a clear planning principle that could apply throughout the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>457</span>
ber for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) put his finger on what is the most difficult problem in the Bill generally. A number of us have said over and over againâ€”and he has been quite right to reiterate it this eveningâ€”that this Bill has no consistent underlying principle. I will not go back to Maud or the proposals of the previous Administration but, whether one agreed with them or not, there was a recognisable thread, a logic of principle which one had to accept. Here there is no such principle, no such thread, and my hon. Friend is quite right to point this out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From time to time the Minister and I make noises about one another's consistency, and the Under-Secretary and I do the same, but this is because it is difficult in a Bill of this nature to adopt the same standard throughout the Bill. I am in favour of education, for example, being at the metropolitan county level, and I find myself faeed with the situation that, in the context of the Bill, I have to decide whether it is better that education shall be as it is now, with proposed metropolitan district councils where I know the education is reasonable, good, compact, and where I know there are opportunities, or whether I think that is better than something else in the Bill which I would not have had in the Bill. Inevitably, therefore, it must appear inconsistent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary is quite right to say, "You would have preferred education to have been under the metropolitan county", but equally I am right in pointing out to him that he is also inconsistent in this. All the arguments he has adduced or will adduce laterâ€”and I look forward with great anticipation to his arguments in favour of education being at the metropolitan district levelâ€”will negative everything he has said today. He has been good about this, because he has said very little about it, but he has said enough for me to be able to quote back at him in a Clause or two or 100 Clauses or so when the moment arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This inconsistency is something which we are bound to face in a Bill which itself is so inconsistent. Here again is a difficulty that arises. The Under-Secretary complains bitterlyâ€”sometimes, even shrilly, and I do not use that word offensively, perhaps "plaintively" would be a better wordâ€”that when he is
	<span class='label label-info column'>458</span>
flexible I tell him he should not be flexible, and when he is ruthless and inflexible, and doing gritty governing, I tell him that he should be flexible. One of the troubles of the Bill is that it has no consistent pattern, and one must judge everything as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of these inconsistencies arise when one talks about country and town, or country dominating town. The Under-Secretary used the phrase "using the slogans of the Second Reading" or something like that, as though the Second Reading is or was a collection of slogans. My memory is that the Second Reading was a collection of constituency moans almost from beginning to end, except for the two Front Benches. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) was right to argue that if it is not the fear of country dominating town it is at least the fear of a continuation of what we call the cold war between country and townâ€”the pull-away that occurs between the two areas. Hon. Members on this side of the Committee have always saidâ€”and I give credit to the Under-Secretary and his Administration for seeing the pointâ€”that the two should work together if they can. The only question is whether the method adopted is the best way of seeing that they work together. I do not think that it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious and difficult point that the Under-Secretary will have to face. He says, "It is ridiculous of you to say that the rural areas of our new Hampshire will dominate the towns", and he quotes statistics. Statistics can be chosen to suit one's case. I could quote other statistics at him. I could point out that he uses Southampton in two sensesâ€”as, I must confess, I have done myself. He refers either to Southampton as it stands at the moment or Southampton as it would be under the district council proposition. I suppose that there is a difference in population of about 250,000, so it can be used either way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must all agree about facing one point of principle. Perhaps it is as well to face it now, for it is liable to arise in the next series of Amendments which I hope will be selected. I am referring to the question whether, in deciding whether to have a metropolitan county with a strong dominant urban population, we should also consider the inevitable growth in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>459</span>
population that will take place in a very short time. This is a question of principle, even within the context of a Bill singularly devoid of principle and so much concerned with detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we to consider this? My case is that we must consider it. I referred to a measurable period of time, but what is a measurable period of time? Is it half a generationâ€”the time it takes for a child born this year to have left school under the present system. If we cannot look that far ahead I do not know why we are planning local government at all. In another place the noble Lord, Lord Jellicoe expressed the view that this system of local government would last for a century. He said that if we could not look ahead for 15 years out of that century he did not know what we were coming to. If we can look ahead for 15 years we must take into account this growth of population, particularly as we all know that it will take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot avoid this duty. That is what may convert Hampshire into what ought to be a metropolitan county, and even if the arguments of the Under-Secretaryâ€”and I do not accept them allâ€”were absolutely true at this moment, they would not be true within the next 15 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are they absolutely true at this moment? I have been given the figures for the proposed seats on the new council, as it stands in the Bill. Possibly I have been given wrong information. My understanding is that Hampshire will have 64 seats, Southampton 16, Portsmouth 15, and the Isle of Wight eight. If that is not a dominationâ€”out of all proportion according to my mathematical device that one may care to useâ€”of the rural elements of Hampshire over the large urban areas of Southampton and Portsmouth, I do not what is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be gerrymandering, as my hon. Friend says. If so, for the reason that I have given it is very incompetent gerrymandering, since within 15 years the population pattern will change. However, that is the situation at the moment. The proper progress of Southampton and Portsmouth will be delayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other point I should like to have clearly answered. I said that we must accept inconsistencies, because the Bill itself is inconsistent. We must learn to live with these inconsistencies. I was seeking to make a point in connection with educationâ€”not as forcibly as I should have done, perhaps, or the Under-Secretary would have replied to it more clearly. Here is a good system of education. It is advanced, and is being maintained in new buildings, by a staff that is keen, energetic and well able to match the difficulties and problems of our age. That applies to both Southampton and Portsmouth. The Under-Secretary accepted that that was so. Does he not also accept that the dislocation that will take place should his new Hampshire come into effect will take years to settle down? If he accepts that, he must agree to reconsider the question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should naturally pefer it to be a metropolitan county. I should naturally prefer education to be with a metropolitan county. But this is the Under-Secretary's Bill not mine. If he were to grant that education should be with the metropolitan county I should have no objection, because the type of education now being maintained in Southampton and Portsmouth could well proceed to an upper level. That would be a quite tenable proposition in a metropolitan county However, I am afraid that dominance of rural Hampshire over the metropolitan districts of Portsmouth and Southampton may mean decay in a good system of education that could be made better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have deliberately not spoken at length. We all wish to make progress with the Bill, and there is much work before us. However, I should be grateful to have an answer to the points that I have raised. Depending on the answer of the Under-Secretary I will consider what ought to be the next move. Perhaps one of my hon. Friends still has a comment to make. However, it is important that the Under-Secretary should deal with these points. They are vital points, and they strongly affect all those who have experience of local government, teaching and planning in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am especially anxious to speak on these Amendments, because I used to work in Hampshire.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>461</span>
You will probably hear me say the same thing, Sir Stephen, when I speak on other Amendments. I should explain that the first job I ever had was that of an auditor. I travelled the length and breadth of this country, and lived and worked in many of them. It was only because I was persuaded by my right hon. Friend that I restrained myself from speaking with some heat about Greater Manchester, where I have not only worked but from where my wife's family come. In fact they come from Culcheth. I felt quite strongly about the Amendment, but it has now passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I worked for some time in Hampshire, and I have since travelled it in the course of other employments. There are differences between different parts of the county. This is a point that we shall make on further Amendments. There are great differences between Basingstoke and Andover, which are expanding towns with overspill development, and which have some interests in common. There are differences between Southampton and Portsmouth, which have some community of interest but obviously wish to be separateâ€”and the Isle of Wight is completely different from the other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendments do not rigidly separate town and country. Parts of the rural area near Southamptonâ€”particularly the New Forest rural district, where I workâ€”look towards Southampton as a natural centre. That is not to say that Southampton should be linked with the northern part of the county. This big rural area stretches across the middle of Hampshire, between Southampton, Basingstoke and Andover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[Mr. ALAN FITCH 	<i>in the Chair.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anybody who has been to Beaulieu, Brockenhurst and Lyndhurst knows that they are rural areas. But their natural centre is Southampton, and the Amendment would link them with Southampton in a metropolitan district. So it quite rightly ends that division between town and country. Both sides of the Committee would probably agree with that. However, there are differences between the south of Hampshire, the north of Hampshire and the part in between.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that it is inconsistent for some hon. Members on this side of the Committee to advocate a metropolitan county with education being derogated to the metropolitan district, in view of opposition to education being run by metro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>462</span>
politan districts. I see rather more merit in education being organised by metropolitan districts than do some of my hon. Friends. Many people have said that we need a principle to apply. I have some reservations about that. I am a little sceptical about the ability to find a principle that has national application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to make any criticisms about differences of treatment between Wales and England. That is a separate issue, particularly when discussing parish councils. But I do not think that we can apply to Greater Manchester or to South Hampshire the principle that we would have to apply to Devon, Cornwall or Somerset. There are tremendous differences between the West Midlands, for example, and the South-West. I am prepared to be much more pragmatic than are some hon. Members. Based on my personal knowledge of the area I am prepared to support a metropolitan county for Hampshire, with a division into metropolitan districts. [Sir STEPHEN MCADDEN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that both political parties in the city of Southampton feel that it should be the centre of a metropolitan district, as proposed in the Amendment. I have received a letter signed by members of both parties, referring to the organisation of education. I have a great deal of sympathy with them when they argue that too large an area, such as Hampshire, would adversely affect the organisation of personal services and education. I have some sympathy with their view that they would like this type of service to be under a smaller local government unit, though they must recognise that in some ways, particularly with strategic planning, they have much in common with the rest of Hampshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important factor. Some research has been done into the minimum size for local authorities. I have not seen anything about the maximum size. I know from many friends in London that they feel that the reorganisation of London may be criticised o the ground that it has made local government more remote from the people. I do not want to repeat our earlier arguments about the meaning of "remote", whether it is distance or the number of electors, but I have some sympathy with the view that not enough research has been done into the optimum size of authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having come fairly recently from in-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>463</span>
dustry, I believe that one can have an industrial unit that is too big. The optimum size for an industrial unit would vary according to the nature of the industry; in other words, there is not a magic figure or a magic size, whether of turnover or value of assets. Local government units should be looked at in the some way to see what the optimum size should be. It cannot be assessed just by population, for account must be taken of distance, geographical nature and size of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A non-metropolitan county of the size proposed by the Government would be a mistake. The letter I have already mentioned says that the Government are planning a major mistake by creating a new Hampshire county with a population of 1Â½ million. When we are talking about a non-metropolitan county of 1Â½ million people, we are in grave danger of making a mistake, whether the citizens of Southampton are right or wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) referred to the principle. The Government's principle is simply democracy, and the important question is what is wanted by the people of Southampton and the rest of Hampshire, the people of Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight. There has not been enough discussion and consideration of this important question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be times when we should create units of local government which are not as efficient as we could create, and we should create that degree of inefficiency when that is what people want. Democracy is worth a degree of inefficiency. We have heard some reference to the pressure on hon. Members from Southampton. We have heard about correspondence received by my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. R. C. Mitchell). We have not heard yet from the Government why the wishes of the citizens of Southampton should be flouted. I hope that the Minister will now answer this question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of what I said earlier about the maps, may I say that this map is extremely helpful for following the argument of my right hon. and hon. Friends? Putting the whole of this area into one county, without providing for a breakdown into metropolitan districts, is manifestly geographic non-
	<span class='label label-info column'>464</span>
sense. What the map shows is the shape of the parish boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In areas such as Andover Rural District and Winchester Rural District one sees the characteristic elongated shape of parish boundaries which typifies the English scarp and vale scenery, whereas around Basingstoke and north of there the pattern of parish boundaries is similar to that around Reading. Those are distinct geographic areas. The area in the north is oriented much more towards the London basin, whereas the central part is entirely different in character from the southern part around the Solent estuary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having served in the Navy at Portsmouth and at Gosport, I know that area fairly well. I am sure that the Amendments are sensible in the light of what actually exists on the ground. Whatever administrative convenience may have motivated the Government's proposal. I do not feel that it is borne out by the geographic facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully support the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis). I ask the Minister to say just how much the geographic character of the area and the different regions into which it may be divided is compatible with the Government's proposals and whether it would not be better to have second thoughts and to give some sort of structure to the area that would allow each of these different regions to reflect its own identity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basingstoke Rural District, bordering on Reading and close to the newly opening M4, requires entirely different treatment from, say, the New Forest or the Isle of Wight, whereas the growth potential of the Solent with Southampton and Portsmouth, particularly in view of our proposed entry into the Common Market, is tremendous. I should be grateful if the Minister would deal, if only briefly, with the extent to which geographic features were taken into account in formulating the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will deal first with the last point by the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) about the scale of the proposals which we are discussing, those in the Bill and those in the Amendments. Of course there are wide differences between the northern areas, which were also described by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>465</span>
hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis), but those problems would exist under the Amendments as well as under the proposals in the Bill, because both envisage either a county or a metropolitan county for that area. All those involved in the discussion this afternoon are attempting to bring the whole area under one overall strategic control. I do not think that at this stage there is any attempt to change that situation, unless another set of proposals is put forward. It is true that it was changed, if I remember correctly, in the Redcliffe-Maud concept, by which the northern areas were divided into various new authorities grouped in different directions, but that is not what we are now discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bromsgrove described the differences, which he knew personally, between the north and the south of the area. I have covered that. He also made the sensible if slightly unpalatable observation that there was no principle which one could apply. This brings us to the point on which this section of the debate began when the hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) said that he was in a dilemma because he saw what he regarded as the inherent contradiction between the arguments used in this debate and those in a debate on an earlier Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my first comments on the Schedule I tried to anticipate that very point, which certainly worried me when, coming new to the subject, now some time ago, I began to look for the coherent package solution, the instant local government formula, which one could apply so as to find that everything fitted neatly into the package. It simply does not work out like that on the ground. Any proposals for reorganisation would have encountered anomalies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, they are not quite such a set of anomalies as the hon. Member for South Shields imagined. He was asking me to reconcile arguments applied to the Metropolitan County of Greater Manchester, with which we were dealing at that time, and arguments, applied to the new county of Hampshire, which I am now defending. There is this very real difference. The hon. Member asked me why it was, when dealing with the Greater Manchester conurbation, one had not accepted the argument of the area within which the total plan could be
	<span class='label label-info column'>466</span>
brought forward, as I was using that argument to justify the concept of the Hampshire county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to that is that the scale upon which one would need to plan a great conurbation is so large that it would make local government, with which we are concerned, meaningless. One would have to take in such a vast hinterland, if one wanted to cope with all the problems of the conurbation, that I believe it would be quite unacceptable in any framework which we might produce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not this give me the case I have always argued for the province?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it gives the case provided that the hon. Gentleman does not argue the case any further on this narrow issue. What we are not doing is arriving on this earth from Mars in order to create a planner's dream. The fact is that one is dealing with people and loyalties and the fears and aspirations of local communities and of their local elected representatives. One has to try to combine all the facets of local government into a reorganisation which will be acceptable to the overwhelming majority of people who have to live within it and to make it work. This was the problem which the last Government found and were no nearer to solving by the time they left officeâ€”that the Martian solution, the planner's dream of resolving local government reorganisation simply is not on. It is too unacceptable to too many people in too many parts of the country. That is why I believe they would not have been able to legislate along the lines that they indicated when they were in office, but that is another argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dealing with the figures that were put forward by the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) in trying to understand the figures that I gave about the dominance of town and country, I think that my figures were more reflective of the situation on the ground if one forgets all local authority boundaries as they now exist. I was talking about people who live in towns, people who live in rural areas and the need to blend the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly true if one asks how the individual local authorities as they now exist obtain representation on the new council. No one has worked out the figures yet, and the total number of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>467</span>
elected representatives has not been finally fixed, so nobody can finally say what the allocation of seats will be. I do not want to make an argument of the figures as put forward by the right hon. Member, but, taking that his figures are near enough, it is probably true that the existing Hampshire would have about 64, the existing County Borough of Southampton would have 16, the existing County Borough of Portsmouth perhaps would have 15 and the existing Isle of Wight approximately 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the sake of argument, let us assume that on the basis of the existing local authorities those are the facts. But the fact is that those figures in no way relate to the numbers of people who live in urban areas or in rural areas, and the truth is that if one then looks at the balance of the authorities comprised within the present Hampshire County one then finds that a very large number of thoseâ€”approximately two-thirds, I am advisedâ€”live in urban areas. Therefore, the balance will look totally different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems we have come across in discussing this matter with local authorities up and down the country is that, for understandable reasons, a lot of people are not prepared to make the intellectual jump into the concept of the new authorities, but are always thinking in terms of the old.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important question. It is one that I could not answer specifically in as clearcut language as I should like, without checking back to the basis on which my figures were produced. I shall take an early opportunity to give the details for which the right hon. Gentleman has asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the definition which we have accepted, on which my information is based, the vast majority of people living in the new county of Hampshire live in what can be broadly described as urban areas. Therefore, it is not true to say that there will be a weighting in favour of country 	<i>versus</i> town.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If these figures are right, how does the population of Hamp-

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue is not that the present Hampshire will dominate the new authority.

Member for Birmingham:, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) originally was that country would dominate town. That is the issue that matters. The existing Hampshire will disappear, just as the existing county boroughs will disappear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give the figures for the population split. Portsmouth has some 197,000 population, Southampton about 214,000 and Hampshire about 900,000, of which two-thirds live in what can broadly be defined as urban areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subject to the Under-Secretary's undertaking to give us the figures for these urban communities; I know this area fairly well and I do not think that he is on the right tack.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the things that will emerge when I produce the figures in detail is that large numbers of the urban dwellers will be in the spill-over areas around the county boroughs in southern Hampshireâ€”the familiar problem that we all understand. I know from hon. Friends who have consulted me about local problems in their constituencies that many of the growth areas around the county boroughs are urban areas, spilling into the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition to which we have worked is that the two-thirds of Hampshire to which I referred as being broadly urban is made up entirely of all the boroughs and the urban districts. That is the answer to the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the answer to the question, whether the right hon. Member likes the answer is not the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an answer, but it is not the answer to the question I asked. I asked what was the minimum size of an urban community. If the minimum size were, for example, 200, it would be totally
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>469</span>
irrelevant; one is talking about much larger communities than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member knows full well that only a largely urban community can become a borough or an urban district. If I give him the total figure for all the boroughs and urban districts, which amount to about two-thirds of the total population of Hampshire, there is at least a 	<i>prima facie</i> case for saying that that broadly indicates the town dweller as opposed to the country dweller. That must be a fairly convincing answer to the specific point put to me by the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I can help him further. The minimum size of the population in any of those areas is 9,000 and the average is in the 40,000 to 100,000 range. That indicates the size of the boroughs and urban districts which comprise two-thirds of the population of the present Hampshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the flow of information continues unimpeded, can he now find out how many urban communities we are referring to?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will come a point when the definition we seek will narrow the argument to such a stage that meaningful identification of what we are talking about will be lost. With the broad definition of urban districts and boroughs one is on reasonably sound ground in saying that that represents the urban as opposed to the country community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to consider growth when one is reorganising local government. We have built a reviewing mechanism so that one local authority may be converted into another, through processes which we shall be discussing later, without the great traumas associated with these changes in the past. A 15 to 20-year growth would be right, but it would not be right to create a framework to cater for it now. We discussed this in the context of the Bury-Rochdale Amendment. The argument was that in 1990 there would be certain population figures and therefore adjustments to cater for them should be made now. That is wrong. We should do what is necessary in the light of figures as they exist, or are imminently about to exist. However, we should ensure that the reviewing mechanism which the
	<span class='label label-info column'>470</span>
Bill provides is such that we can keep abreast of changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.0 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bromsgrove asked about research into the maximum size of authorities and the powers that they should exercise. The hon. Gentleman conceded, quite rightly, that there had been research into the minimum size, but he was not aware of research into the maximum size. When we reach that part of the Bill dealing with allocation of specific powers it might be right to question whether we have allocated the correct proportion of power according to size of authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's question is academic to the extent that all the authorities of that size would be politically possible, our chief preoccupation as the Opposition and now the Government has been the fear of finding power taken further and further from the people. Researching into larger authorities may be fine as a Martian concept, but it is academic in terms of being able to persuade those people upon whom local government depends to accept authorities of the size that might be involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that the Minister's last argument supported my plea. This is precisely what the people of Southampton say. They are afraid that powers will be taken away from them by this vast, super, new non-metropolitan county area. They are asking that there should be more power at local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not yet dealt with the important fact that all the evidence put before us suggests that the people of Southampton and Portsmouth want a metropolitan county and their own metropolitan district within that county. I cannot see how people in the rest of Hampshire, whose interests should be equally borne in mind, could be hurt if there were a metropolitan county.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is what I said in my first speech. Although it is true that representatives of the two county boroughs have asked that the two should be formed into a metropolitan county, the rest of the authorities in the area have opposed the concept. The vast majority of people are against the concept. Out of 1.46 million people in the

	<span class='label label-info column'>471</span>
new Hampshire county, Southampton and Portsmouth account for 214,000 and 197,000 people between them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may as well clear this issue now, because I shall return to it on later Amendments. Would not the Under-Secretary agree that in this situation there is a case for going beyond the elected representatives? Whether that is done by referendum or by scientific research I do not mind, but there is a case for taking the opinion of the people. The people of Southampton may feel strongly about it, but the people in the rest of Hampshire could not care less.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether there is ground for supposing that people in one part of an area could not care less while others feel passionately. All the information available to the Government suggests that public interest has been at a low level. At practically all the meeting throughout the country comments and questions have come from councillors and officials. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I must not rise to sedentary interruptions again. The public has not become greatly involved, with the exception of one or two specific areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the exercise of reorganising local government it is fair that we should deal with elected representatives, for they are the best barometers. One could always look for others, but I would argue that councillors are elected to do a job and are answerable to the local electorate for their views. It would be an unhappy breach of the good relations between national and local government to go over the heads of councillors and consult their constituents direct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the dilemma of the Under-Secretary in this case. It arises from the fact that there is no perfect solution to this problem. There may be something near it in the idea of the provincial council suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop). However, we are not dealing with provincial councils, but with the situation as it stands. There is no perfect solution. Nevertheless, this solution outrages two of our largest and most important ports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not enough to say that we must deal with the situation as it is now and leave the situation in the next 15 years
	<span class='label label-info column'>472</span>
open to review. That is not a practical way of dealing with the situation. If we are to deal with the reorganisation of local government, let us think ahead, otherwise the Bill will be out of date before it is passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have little hope that the Under-Secretary will think again about this. In a moment I shall ask leave to withdraw the Amendment in order to return to the subject on Report in the hope that By then we shall have adequate evidence that there are large areas inside old Hampshire which would welcome the concept of a metropolitan county. I will endeavour to find the evidence between now and Report. It is no good the Under-Secretary saying that I will not find it. I have an idea that there are advantages of which other areas in old Hampshire have not thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary is saying, "I concede Portsmouth; I concede Southampton; forget the Isle of Wight: that is a rather different situation and may have a special solution. On the other hand, there is the argument of. old Hampshire and we have to deal with elected representatives as they are at the moment. On the whole, I make a majority the other way, but whichever conclusion I reach, somebody will be disappointed." That argument is not good enough. A convincing case will be made out by the time we reach Report, even in the context of what the Under Secretary is saying. For that reason, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Humberside is not so well known, being situated as it is in the North-East. It is isolated; it is about 40 miles from the M1. Most people tend to move South where there is more money and work. Humberside is losing many more of its best young men and women than it has lost for many years past. Hon. Members will find on their map the Isle of Ax-holme, which must not be confused with the Isle of Wight. It does not have the same physical situation and its topography is quite different. I do not intend, therefore, to ask for the Isle of Axholme something asked a few minutes ago on behalf of the Isle of Wight. It is a totally different community in a totally different setting. The Isle of Axholme was well known to the Dutch when they came over to drain our land. The Under-Secretary flew by helicopter to meet our local council to discuss the future of Humberside local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Few people find the time to visit us, but if they do I advise them to visit Spurnpoint, which is on the eastward tip of the peninsular. Spurnpoint is a fine bird sanctuary for the, Yorkshire field naturalists. It is a part of England which in no way suffers by comparison with Hampshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "socio-geography" has been flogged to death in the last few days, but
	<span class='label label-info column'>474</span>
if any area or any authority deserves to be classified in local government terms on a socio-geographical basis it is Humberside. I will take a few minutes to indicate why we believe that we all belong to each other in this partâ€”north and south banksâ€”of the country. We work well and live well together and the Government have made a sound choice. I shall argue in almost diametric opposition to the case to which Minister listened on Hampshire, namely for this to be a metropolitan district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This area has been suggested as an area for expansion, development and growth by nearly all the surveys made in the past few years. All the major economic and social surveys over the last decade have underlined the close relationship between the north and south banks. The Minister is familiar with these surveys, but for his benefit and that the Under-Secretary I will commend to them the document "Humbersideâ€”A Feasibility study", published by the Central Unit for Environmental Planning in 1969. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) spoke about an area not scheduled but destinedâ€”because this is our destiny on Humbersideâ€”for expansion and growth. This is a big factor in considering metropolitan status and that is what the whole discussion is about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was attempting to convey that we have the economic base on North and South Humberside and, more important, that it is thought that we shall have a larger base in the future. I was in the process of citing one or two surveys that bear out all that we hope for in the new authority which has the future economic base on which to sustain this. I quoted the Humberside Feasibility Study, published in 1969, which identifies the enormous potential of South Humberside. At the moment that is petro-chemi-cals in Immingham, and South-East of Grimsby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Yorkshire and Humberside Survey on Regional Strategy, published by the Economic Planning Council in 1970, con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0263">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>475</span>
firms South Humberside's potential for long-term large-scale expansion. Before this, in 1966, a review of Yorkshire and Humberside hammered home the future of Yorkshire and the South Bank. There is no doubt about the area's enormous base and future position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need not bore the Committee with the housing and other surveys, and the surveys of future populations. There is no doubt about South Humberside, that belt from Grimsby and Cleethorpes on the coast, through the centre of Lindseyâ€”North Lindsey; we have never asked for all of Lindsey, and never expected it to be in the joint Humberside areaâ€”to Scunthorpe, with its shining future under the British Steel Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that in talking of the future metropolitan county of Humberside we include North Humberside and South Humberside, Scunthorpe, North Lindsey, Grimsby and Cleethorpes. Within four years there will be even more exciting prospects for industrial expansion and development. The completion of the bridge will give an added fillip to future industrial development. What a vista lies ahead for industrialists to come and settle!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will know of M.I.D.A.S. I believe that we shall be selected as a maritime industrial development area. I can again use the blessed term "socio-geographical". Economically, industrially, and on all those counts, South Humberside is a single entity, all the way through Scunthorpe, North Lindsey, Grimsby, and Cleethorpes, and it will link up with North Humberside to make a viable and immensely powerful area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That area is entirely different in character, needs, outlook and problems from the rest of Lincolnshire. I emphasise that, because I have wind of a harebrained scheme propounded by five of the Under-Secretary's hon. Friends, including the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Kimball) and the hon. Member for Louth (Mr. Jeffrey Archer). There is an early day Motion on the Order Paper about the detachment of part of Lindsey. That is a non-starter. I imagine that the Minister will tell us why the area which he has delineated is the optimum, or the best. Lincolnshire, in the South, is essentially agricultural. In his Memorandum of Dissent, Mr. Derek
	<span class='label label-info column'>476</span>
Senior, himself a socio-geographer, makes these very points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having referred to the economic surveys which overwhelmingly bear out what the Government have chosen as the economic and local government unit, I ask the Committee to think ahead to the future, when the bridge is built. We have waited for more than a centuryâ€”at least since 1869. It would take too long to go over all the decades between. I will skip a few decades, and come to the second Labour Government of 1929-31. In those blessed years, when the then Mr. Herbert Morrison was Minister, we could have built the bridge for Â£3 million, of which the Labour Government would have given 75 per cent. to the city of Hull. We would have had almost four decades of use from that bridge by now, and what a difference that would have made. We are now thinking in terms of a metropolitan county. Had we had that bridge in the interim, with the two banks helping each other we would have been in a far better position tonight in discussing future local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fergus Montgomery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Member's argument. I presume that he is talking about the cost of the bridge. It might have been slightly cheaper than it will be today had it been built when promised by his right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Typical! Absolutely typical! Here am I, making out an historical caseâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is important. I was born in Grimsby and have lived there most of my life, so I know what tremendous excitement the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) occasioned by that wonderful announcementâ€”at a by-election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sir Stephen, like yourself I am slightly bored with the interruptions. Here am I, making out an historical case, and skipping many decades to come to 1929-31, and saying that if we had done this at that time it would have cost my city of Kingston upon Hull not exactly peanuts but a small sum of money. Today, after another 40 yearsâ€”the bridge will be completed in four years' timeâ€”it will cost nearer Â£23 million, with the approach roads and the rest. That amount
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>477</span>
will be borne by the taxpayers and citizens of North and South Humberside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would have changed all our discussions tonight if we had had more numbers thereâ€”the criteria on which we base our case, our population, communications and many of the other factors which the Minister knows so well. The bridge will unite both banks of the Humber, and we shall be a cohesive unit in less than five years. We must emphasise tonight that this cohesive unit will be successful in many ways, not least in attracting some of the best elements in our society. The Humber Estuary is looked upon as the area for future development. I must not quote too many Ministers by name, but it has been conveyed to me that this Government, with all their faults, intend to help us on Humberside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this area we have a most delicate balance between our urban centresâ€”I will not call them conurbations, in the London senseâ€”and the countryside. It is a happy marriage. Hull has a population of 300,000, Grimsby over 100,000â€”we need not quibble over itâ€”and Scunthorpe well over 70,000. These are fine cities, with long traditions. In the past they have enjoyed all the statutory functions of an all-purpose authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will accept that Grimsby is the premier fishing port, will he not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There they go again. Hon. Members opposite will not allow a member of this Committee to get on with a genuine, factual, decent argument in support of his own people. They jump up in a flippant fashion. It would be better if they were kept a little quieter and did not waste so much of their time and the Minister's time. We might have a little more help from hon. Members opposite, and less disturbance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned that five hon. Gentlemen opposite have tabled an early day Motion. Any proposal of that nature, which would attempt to make the all-purpose metropolitan authority on the south bank a long, narrow gutterâ€”from Scunthorpe to the west of Immingham, Barton-on-Humber and along to Cleethorpes and Grimsbyâ€”would be a mistake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman making a case for the district of
	<span class='label label-info column'>478</span>
Humberside or for the metropolitan district of Humberside? We are dealing with the metropolitan district. The hon. Member was saying that it is a happy co-ordination of urban and rural areas which is not one of the characteristics of the metropolitan areas. There is a contradiction here. I accept that his arguments apply so far as a Humberside county is concerned, but not a metropolitan one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>8.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest that the hon. Member makes his case in his own speech later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The officers of these cities know that it will be difficult to set in motion the new county machinery and the council machinery in the metropolitan counties. Nevertheless, it is a challenging proposition. Councillors and staff feel it to be within their capabilities and are eager to undertake the task. I hope that will convince the hon. Gentleman that many people have faith in the new authority, even if he has not. They are people who know more about the area than he does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In c. 253 of the OFFICIAL REPORT my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) referred to the question of Humberside. He paid a delicate compliment to the Under-Secretary who visited us. I know that he enjoyed his visit. He tells me that he did not come by helicopter; but he came to Anlaby and was welcomed there. I think that he went away convinced that the authority would be a good choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford in c. 253 referred to the fact that the Minister had become convinced
	<br><blockquote><p>"â€¦ that this is one compact area. I wonder whether he would go a shade further and make it a metropolitan county. I know the arguments against, such as that there is an insufficiency of population, and so on. But this is very much a growth area, and an area which will have a very important bridge â€¦ which makes the difference."</p></blockquote>
He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the Secretary of State will not go as far as that, will he go this far and say that he will keep the position under constant review and will instruct the Boundary Commission to view the situation very carefully as the population increases?"</p></blockquote>
That was a quotation from the Second Reading debate. Now I should like to quote part of a letter from the Town
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>479</span>
Clerk of Kingston upon Hull which I quoted on Second Reading, in c. 307:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It was also decided 'that having regard to the fact that the three major authorities in the area (the East Riding, Kingston upon Hull and Grimsby) are at present responsible for education, social services and libraries, the Government be invited to declare the Humberside County to be a metropolitan area'."â€”[OFFICIAL REPORT, 16th December, 1971; Vol. 826, cc. 253</p></blockquote>/	<br><blockquote><p>4 and 307.]</p></blockquote>
Note carefully the words and the terms upon which the debate was conducted: "We invite the Government". In the same debate the Shadow Minister asked the Minister to take careful note and look at it in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot, as in the case of Hampshire, quote petitions or letters from teachers. To be frank, there is no enormous body of opinion at the moment to support what I am now asking of the Minister. However, there is no doubt that Grimsby, Scunthorpe and the South Bank would very much like this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quoted earlier a figure of 100,000 in respect of Grimsby. That figure could be increased to 140,000, taking in an outside area. For Scunthorpe 70,000 could easily be increased to 120,000. Thus there could be two metropolitan councils on the South Bank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect to the North Bank, Hull, an all-purpose authority, has been doing everything necessary with respect to education and all statutory functions. East Yorkshire is also an all-purpose authority based upon Beverley. Thus it is not impossible to divide up and be able to work for these particular areas. Given that the bridge is completed in four years' time, the area can easily be integrated. Industry is developing in the south, and Scunthorpe continues to be a successful steel town. We can absorb this population of the South Bank. We have never desired the whole of Lindsey; we do not wish to have any area in the south. Basically, both North and South Bank are satisfactory in this field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What then is the difference between metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties? For example, Barnsley, with a population of 100,000, may fulfil statutory functions in West Yorkshire, while Hull or Grimsby on the Humber, may not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James
	<span class='label label-info column'>480</span>
Johnson) has rather muddled me on this point. He is speaking of two areas north of the Humber and two areas south of the Humber, which he mentioned as Grimsby and Scunthorpe. He then said, "We do not want Lindsey."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has never been suggested that the area should contain South Lindsey. The authority at present comprises the belt of the South Humberside, Scunthorpe and east over to Grimsby. I am claiming that there could well be two divisions there, one based upon Grimsby and one upon Scunthorpe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I make my purpose clear to the Minister? We have talked of the ancient city of Hull being capable of carrying out all these functionsâ€”education, social services, libraries, and others. I have also mentioned the virile town of Grimsby-Scunthorpe has been and still is an education authority, and has done a very fine job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know I am speaking for my colleagues at the South Bank when I say that Grimsby and Scunthorpe are keen to support the Amendment. Having said that, I will concede to the Minister that throughout the area we do not have the usual criteria for this enhanced status. Speaking in terms of population density, conurbations and other criteria, we are not, on the face of it, comparable to Hampshire, which was discussed earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I grant that communications are difficult and will continue to be difficult when the bridge is up in four years time. I also give that to the Minister. I do not know whether he wants it, but I want to make this an open and effectual debate. So, speaking in terms of population, conurbations or communications it is difficult at the moment. However, speaking of administration at the lower level, not only Hull and Grimsby but East Yorkshire have been, and still are, all-purpose authorities. They have done a wonderful job. Scunthorpe has also done the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the difference between metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties. I was diverted when I mentioned Barnsley. But many people in East Yorkshire look at a town like Barnsley, Wakefield and others, and they see that these places can have this special status whereas we cannot on the Humber. There is nothing visible on the map as to population and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>481</span>
other criteria which the Minister is demanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These areas have done a good job, and they are asking whether it is possibleâ€”although the Minister did not feel able this evening, as on Second Reading, to accept this future stateâ€”to know his views about the possibility of some form of devolution. Is it possible to have, for example, some form of 	<i>ad hoc</i> devolution in education? Is it possible to have, to coin a phrase, agency arrangements, particularly in education?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister look at Clause 185? Does subsection (2) invalidate any possibility of agency arrangements, whereby we do not lose our schools? I ask the Minister to think about this, because communications are difficult, and we shall find it difficult to organise before the bridge is up over this whole area on the north and south banks of the Humber.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and I both recognise the concept that the Government have given us north and south of the Humber with these all-purpose authorities, but does he appreciate the organisational difficulties at present? I hope the Committee will appreciate how careful I have been. I am inviting the Minister to think aloud upon this matter. Before the bridge is up we shall have three or four years to organise in the way that other more compact metropolitan counties or non-metropolitan counties will have to organise. I am asking the Minister to give us the benefit of the way in which his mind is working. I ask this especially on behalf of the sister towns of Grimsby and Scunthorpe. In Hull we are fairly self-sufficient, but I shall await the Minister's words with keen anticipation when he replies on the Humber metropolitan authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Edmund Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the second case where this Committee has been faced with having to make a decision as to whether one of the counties proposed in the Bill should be metropolitan or non-metropolitan. I admit that I find a great deal of confusion about the relative status of metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties, and I ask for some clarification, because it is applicable not just to this, but to other cases which we shall be discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand itâ€”and it is necessary to go back slightly in historyâ€”the concept of a metropolitan county was born in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>482</span>
Report of the Redcliffe-Maud Commission. The concept was then brought forward in contradistinction to the unitary authorities. The basic reason why the Redcliffe-Maud Commission felt that in certain parts of the country there should be these metropolitan authorities was that in those areas the unitary principle was not applicable. It was necessary in heavily built-up areas to have two tiers of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As shown in paragraph 278 of that Report, the whole idea of the metropolitan county was brought in to be a two-tier as opposed to a unitary authority. This idea was further extended in the White Paper which the Labour Government introduced to implement proposals based largely on the Redcliffe-Maud Report. The only difference was that in two extra casesâ€”West Yorkshire and South Hampshireâ€”the Labour Government thought that the metropolitan principle should be applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in those two cases, the areas designated in the Redcliffe-Maud Report as unitary areas took on the status of metropolitan districts, and a number of the metropolitan districts were combined to form metropolitan counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.0 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The choice at that time was still between metropolitan counties or unitary authorities. Most of the arguments then put forward for metropolitan status were based on this choice. That situation has now completely changed, because no longer have we the unitary authorities. In the Bill, the choice with which we are faced now is metropolitan or non-metropolitan, and all the arguments for metropolitan status based on the need for a two-tier authority no longer apply, because two-tier local government is now proposed throughout the country. Much of what has been said up to the publication of the Government's White Paper about the need for metropolitan authorities in some areas is, therefore, no longer applicable. Two-tier local government throughout England is proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What, then, is the difference between metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties? The differences are not great. There is the difference of districts and district boundaries. In the Bill, metropolitan counties are clearly listed with all the boundaries of the metropolitan districts firmly laid down. In the Amendment, we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>483</span>
are not given any suggestion as to what these metropolitan district boundaries should be on Humberside. Generally, with regard to metropolitan counties, the district boundaries are finalised in the Bill. In non-metropolitan counties, the districts are still to be settled after consultation, recommendations by the Commission, and so on. One basic difference between metropolitan and non-metropolitan status is simply that district boundaries are to be settled for one in the Bill while for the other they are to be settled after the Bill is passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Applying this to the proposed Humberside county, we are in no position whatever to be able to finalise district boundaries within Humberside now. I do not want to harp on the history of recent months and the suddenness with which the Humberside county proposal emerged, but one difficulty of the local authorities because of the suddenness of this proposal was that they have had no chance to consult fully amongst themselves with regard to the best district boundaries within Humberside. They are in no position to move towards finalising those district boundaries, as metropolitan status would require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the other differences between metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties, namely, with regard to functions. Again the differences are not great. There is the controversial subject of which tier should be responsible for education. In the metropolitan counties it goes to the districts; in the non-metropolitan counties it goes to the counties. Many Members on both sides of the Committee may feel that those general proposals are wrong. With regard to Humberside, the possibility of having educational responsibility at a level below county level is something which people in North Lincolnshire and in the East Riding would be glad to investigate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other functions which are different between the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties are the personal social services which are assigned to metropolitan district councils, and passenger transport authorities, which are assigned to metropolitan county councils. In Humberside, it is ludicrous to think of one passenger transport authority covering the lot. Until the bridge across the Humberside is completed, the two parts of the county are somewhat divorced
	<span class='label label-info column'>484</span>
as regards transport. It would be very difficult to bring the many transport operators in North Lincolnshire and the East Riding under the umbrella of one passenger transport authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have now reached the stage where the difference between metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties is being greatly exaggerated. I suspect that in many quarters metropolitan county status is being used as a status symbol. Certain areas which find it difficult to adapt to some of the suggested changes try to sugar the pill by saying that they will all be metropolitan. As a result, if a county is not in favour it is made a metropolitan county. Those who know North Lincolnshire and the East Ridingâ€”and there are other Members of the Committee with long experience of both banks of the Humberâ€”know that this area is not metropolitan. It may be that after hundreds of years of development this is something to be considered further, but as things stand this county is not metropolitan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It would take a very long time for the whole of this county to be brought up to anything that could be described as metropolitan status. The present population of Humberside is 847,000, a density of less than one person per acre. [An hon. Member: "They are all sheep."] There are not that many sheep in that part of the world. The agriculture is much more varied. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would have known that from his experience as a parliamentary candidate in North Lincolnshire. The population density of the whole of Humberside is less than one person per acre.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the population of Humberside, almost exactly one-third is within the city of Kingston upon Hullâ€”285,000 out of 847,000. Almost exactly another one-third is in the urban areas of Grimsby, Haltem-price, Scunthorpe, Cleethorpes and Goole. Together with Hull, those towns make up almost exactly two-thirds of the entire population of the proposed county of Humberside. When one looks at a map and sees the enormous expanse of the proposed county, one realises what sparsely populated areas there must be elsewhere within its boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Againâ€”I know that this is true from personal experience over many yearsâ€”going up into the Lincolnshire Wolds, a very large section of which is included in the new county, going up towards Caistor is a very sparsely populated area. The same applies across the Humber, with the continuation of the same geological formation, in the Yorkshire Wolds. To the west of the Lincolnshire Wolds is the broad valley of the River Ancholme, a predominantly agricultural area in which drainage problems have made it difficult at times for large population development. Further to the west, passing Scunthorpe and crossing the Trent, one comes to the Isle of Axholme, an area to which my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson) referred earlier. Again, it is an area in which agriculture is the predominant industry and in which settlement is sparse. There are clearly defined villages, but apart from those the landscape just takes in the occasional farmstead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That kind of topography and geographical settlement stretches all the way from the Isle of Axholme into my constituency in the Goole rural district and across the Ouse into Howden rural district. Anybody who wishes to see some of the really rural parts of England would do well to come to those parts of my constituency. In Goole rural district there is flat marshland where one can go for mile upon mile without seeing any buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moving into the East Riding, I have mentioned already the Yorkshire Wolds.
	<span class='label label-info column'>486</span>
On either side of those there are agricultural areas. The Pocklington and Howden rural districtsâ€”are again typical English rural areas. On the sea side of the Yorkshire Wolds there is the flat coastal plain which tapers into the peninsula of Holderness, and, like my hon. Friend, I have visited Spurn Head and Spurn Point, and I remember from my visits to that part of Yorkshire that I felt there could be hardly any other part of England in which one had a feeling of greater remoteness. This is certainly an area in which one feels far from the madding throng.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

that my point has been taken. I trust that all Members will feel the same as you. Sir Stephen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not pursue the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson) about the possibility of these open spaces becoming outlets for population. I was seeking simply to describe things as they are. I was not thinking of things as they might become.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Humberside is not a metropolitan county and on any definition of the word "metropolitan"â€”and I hope there will be some guidance about what is to be intended by metropolitan statusâ€”it seems that Humberside is one of the counties that should certainly not be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Housing and Local Government (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thoroughly agreed with about the first 20 minutes of the speech of the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson). He was putting forward the arguments which appealed to me at the time when we decided that there should be a Humberside county. Originally, we had a county in East Yorkshire, the southern boundary of which was the Humber, and the populous area of it was right on the southern boundary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the probable development of the area, that populous area of Kingston upon Hull might develop to the west. There was not much chance of it developing to the east, and certainly no chance of it developing to the north, so one was forced to look to the other side of the Humber, especially in view of previous feasibility studies, and there one saw that there was great potential for development. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman has referred to the Humberside Feasibility Study and to a study produced by the Yorkshire and Humberside Economic Planning Council. The Humberside Feasibility Study, published in April, 1969, concluded that the area had the physical potential to absorb three-quarters of a million people by the end of the century. It estimated that existing plans were adequate to cope with the increase in the country's population until about 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was little definite projection of a firm idea of increased population in
	<span class='label label-info column'>488</span>
that study, or in any of the studies. It is accepted that there will be growth in that area but it is difficult to predict how fast it will be, on both the north and south side of the Humber, at what stage it will become a populous area and at what stage, if at all, it will become comparable with such areas as Merseyside or Tyneside in a compact population. It would be doubtful if the county as we have now drawn it ever becomes built up in the way that the other six metropolitan counties which we have chosen are already built up and populous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tried to apply the rule laid down in para. 31 of the White Paper, which states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The metropolitan pattern is suitable only where a county is divisible into districts all of which are populous and compact."</p></blockquote>
By no stretch of the imagination could one say that this Humberside county could be divided into districts which are all populous and compact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in some difficulty in dealing with the Amendment because as it appears on the Order Paper it is for a single district metropolitan countyâ€”in fact, going back to the unitary county. There is no division between districts. As we have discussed thoroughly the unitary system as against the two-level system I do not wish to go back on that again, and I am treating the Amendment as one in which one would look for a division of metropolitan districts within this metropolitan county. If I dealt with it on that basis I should have to find that there are districts which are compact and heavily populated, which would produce districts which would be able to carry out the functions that we have allotted to metropolitan districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Para. 30 of the White Paper, in referring to the six metropolitan districts that we have chosen, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These six areas need to be treated as entities for purposes of planning, transportation and certain other services; at the same time the districts into which they divide would all be big enough in population and resources, and sufficiently compact in size to be responsible for education and the personal services, as well as the more local functions."</p></blockquote>
Applying that test to this area. I assume one would have to find four districts in this area. The one based on Hull would, on its own, make an admirable metropolitan district, compact and about the right population. Then one has to look at the rest of the county. If the East
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0270">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>489</span>
Riding and Goole were turned into a metropolitan district, it would have a population of under the one quarter of a million, the figure which we look for in the metropolitan districts. Apart from that, it would cover such a tremendously wide area geographically and could not be described in any sense as a populous or compact area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
South of the Humber it might be possible to put everything into one district, from Scunthorpe to Grimsby, but that would be a bipolar district, which would not make much sense. If, having decided that it is quite impossible to do that, one divides the two, one is left with areas which are far too small to make up metropolitan districts on their ownâ€”Scunthorpe would be about 134,000 and Grimsby-Cleethorpes 179,000â€”even if we were to assume that the population in these areas would increase, and there is some doubt about that. The population of Hull has fallen in the past 20 years, and those of Grimsby and Scunthorpe have stayed the same. The one place where there has been a substantial increase is Grimsby Ruralâ€”the Immingham areaâ€”which has gone up about 20,000 in that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister accept this as the usual phenomenon? It is a constant feature of all cities, particularly in North America, and now beginning in the United Kingdom, that people leave the centres of towns, particularly the younger executive in the motor-car age, to live outside the city council boundary. The Minister must know that 20,000 or more people have left Hull to live outside, although they are still a part of what might loosely be termed the larger conurbation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite satisfied that there will be an increase in population over the whole county as we have set it out, but I cannot as yet guess where that increase will be, or the areas in which it will build up most. We Shall find out much more about that when we have the full economic planning study and strategy from the Economic Planning Council and the standing conference of local planning authorities in the area. I readily accept the statement in the Humberside Study that by the end of the century the area will be accommodating 2 million people. However, it is not cer-
	<span class='label label-info column'>490</span>
tain, and one cannot base a structure of a metropolitan county on such guesswork.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite ready to respond to the request made by the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) in the course of the Second Reading debate, who asked whether the Secretary of State would go so far as to say that he would keep the position under constant review, and would instruct the Boundary Commission to review the situation very carefully as the population increased. I shall not go so far as to say that we will be continually instructing the Boundary Commission to do that, but, having put that power into the Bill, at any time the Secretary of State can be urged by those who are watching it to give instruction to the Boundary Commission accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are conscious of the probable increase, but do not think the county as drawn now is the kind of populous and compact area which makes a metropolitan county. I can give the assurance that we shall watch it, and I imagine that any Government in office for the next 10 to 20 years will watch the area to see whether it is ripe for the same powers and functions as apply in other metropolitan counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One final point. Much of our thinking on this was based on the Humber Bridge being built within the course of a matter of years. Communications between the two sides are now poor, but there is a community spirit and the same kind of development both sides of the Humber to make it worth joining them together, even though the bridge is not yet built. During this interim period until the bridge is built, and all the roads to serve it north and south, east and west, there will have to be fairly special agencies between the district authorities and the county authority, and the county authority will obviously have to make provision to administer some of the county's services locally. I do not see any difficulty about that. It can certainly be done under the Clause which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, Clause 185.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There cannot be district education agencies because any authority which is carrying out education must have an education committee. In other local government functions, especially in this area until the Humber Bridge is built, there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>491</span>
will have to be considerable co-operation between the district and the county.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate for a reason perhaps which lies beneath the surface, but is not spoken out loud, namely, how are we to treat an area, whether as a county in its own right or as a metropolitan county, which we all know to be developing but the shape of which we cannot at the moment see? To some extent, the same applied when we considered the question of Hampshire. We had to have a sort of guess quotient or guess factor in what we were examining. Of course, it applies even more in the case of Humberside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, like the Minister, found that the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson) would not stand up on its own unless there was a single district council metropolitan county. I thought this was rather an absurdity. But I was glad that the Minister did not make the point that other Ministers so often make, that because an Amendment appears to them to be defective the idea behind it should immediately be destroyed and forgotten. That is never a good way of doing things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows my philosophy. I have put it to him before on other Bills. It is that the Government pay the draftsmen and it is up to them to get the legislation right. The Opposition merely put forward their ideas and, if they are imperfect in their conclusions, so long as the substance is put across that is good enough. These things can always be perfected. It does not matter whether the Amendment is correct. It is perfect-able, and it is on that basis that we consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend and the Minister quoted my speech on Second Reading. It was not exactly a masterpiece of English literature, geography or local government research.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are too modest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always have been. Incidentally, I am very glad to see the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Awdry) with us. Earlier today he was talking about paying great attention to the merits and demerits of every argument. It is nice that he has now joined us when we
	<span class='label label-info column'>492</span>
are discussing Humberside, because it is an important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that my hon. Friend and the Minister quoted my Second Reading speech because I was groping for something to say. I was a little unsure of how one should proceed and was trying to get some basis for the future. I think we all agree that this is a rapidly changing area. Once it has its bridge, its growth will be so rapid that it will affect the living conditions of all the people who live in what we now call Humberside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister very fairly said that Hull's population has fallen, but it may well rise. If the rural areas are included, the population of Grimsby has risen by 20,000. It may well be that there will be a vast increase in population, but who knows where? It may come in any part of the area, and it is a large area. The Minister asks how the Government can base a metropolitan county on set metropolitan districts when they do not know where the population flow will come. I accept that. I think that the Minister is right. I hope that my hon. Friend will also accept that, on mature consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's answer was something which I was moving towards during the Second Reading debate, namely, that we ought to be able to keep the position under constant reviewâ€”more, perhaps, than in other areas, because this area will change enormously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One thing that has not been mentioned in the calculations is the effect of our possible entry into Europe. In the southern part of the area was situated one of the main centres of Bomber Command during the War.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one way of entering Europe, I suppose. Whether or not we go into the Common Marketâ€”I maintain that that is not the same as going into Europeâ€”the City of Hull will trade with the rest of the Continent of Europe quite genuinely. Our trade, even outside the members of the Common Market, has increased considerably with that part of Europe that faces Hull, whether it be Germany, Holland or the Scandinavian countries, and will continue to increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the days of the Romans the problem in Humberside area has always been one of communicationâ€”Communication not so much with the rest of Europe as with the rest of this island.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>493</span>
That is why the Humber Bridge is of such importance. It does not matter whether anyone promised it during by-elections or not; thank heaven it is coming. It is the vital link that is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are to consult elected authorities and so onâ€”the Under-Secretary has paid his visitâ€”it is clear that this area will be a new and powerful economic unit with the advantages of a conurbation, such as a large pool of labour, a large market and so onâ€”I will not read the whole thing because the Under-Secretary has already done so. But the Government cannot say when it will happen. It ought to happen within the next decade or so. Equally, the Government cannot say exactly where it will happen. That is the difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall). Is there such importance in the difference between the status of a county and the status of a metropolitan county as to cause us to spend our time discussing that in Committee? The answer is "Yes", if one considers the position of those areas which would be metropolitan district councils. They have important powers in a metropolitan county which they would not have in a county. I do not wholeheartedly approve of some of the powers, for example, in education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend says, "I can understand this in the context of Maud, but really in this context does it matter?" I think that it does, because of the division of powers and functions which arise in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me back to what the Minister said. I found myself agreeing with him rather more than I had hoped or intended to do. I really must not agree with the Minister too much. Apart from anything else, it rather worries him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that effective areas of local governmentâ€”district councils and metropolitan district councilsâ€”should be populous and compact. I agree completely. I followed very fully his division of Humberside, and agree that that might be an almost ideal metropolitan district, except that we cannot have single metropolitan district councils. A single metropolitan district council is just not on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister went on to say that the East Riding and Goole, with under a quarter of a million population, might just do, although he did not like it very much.
	<span class='label label-info column'>494</span>
However, there is then the question of distances. Presumably this is an area the population of which will increase during the next 10 or 15 years. However, none of us knows whether that will be the case, and the Minister quite fairly said that he did not know. How can one create a metropolitan district only to find later that the population has increased somewhere else? He made the same sensible and fair point with regard to Scunthorpe. I am not an expert on the area, but I do not think the point is quite so strong with respect to the Grimsby-Cleethorpes grouping, which appears to be continually expanding, for the reasons which my hon. Friend put forward. I thought that they were very sensible reasons, and I was surprised that the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) seemed to think it amusing to quote American precedentsâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which American precedents did I quote?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member did not quote the American precedents. They were quoted by my hon. Friend, whereupon the hon. Gentleman laughed and said that they had nothing to do with the question. The hon. Gentleman should read the Buchanan Report of 1963. He will discover that what happens in America is likely to occur in this country, 30 years later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that the area is growing, and foreseeably growing, so that it might form almost another metropolitan district. Again, one is left with the imponderables. After considering the question as fairly as possible in relation to the area, I have reached the following conclusion. My hon. Friend's perfectable Amendment seems not to express the basic fact of Humberside at the present time, although it may well reflect the situation following the completion of the bridge. As has been said, the bridge will be a catalyst. Whether or not we enter the Common Market this is an expanding area, which will develop in any case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I revert to the Minister's kind reference to my speech on Second Reading. Having previously been unduly modest I may perhaps momentarily be allowed to be unduly arrogant. It seems to me that the sensible way of dealing with what is a very important problem, and one that will greatly increase during the next 15 years, is to keep the position under constant review. That was my suggestion, and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0273">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>495</span>
Minister kindly endorsed that it was probably the solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what my hon. Friend intends to do about the Amendment. I see the sense of his argument, but it may be five or 10 years premature. My advice would be to accept the Minister's position, which seems helpful and would ensure that the future of Humberside is preserved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that everyone in the Committee is of the opinion that the choice of Humberside was right; that whether it is a county or a metropolitan county it is something on its own. When the Under-Secretary visited it I am sure that he was reassured in the view that it was a unit on its own. It raises the question of estuarial units in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that thought has been given to this point by the Minister. I find myself in a little difficulty. There is a community of interest on both sides of an important lifeline river like the Humber. The Thames is another obvious example. One is tempted to see a grouping and similarity in those areas and to think of estuarial counties. I have not fully developed that thought. The Minister is in a better position to consider whether Humberside is separate from other estuarial areasâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that it is part of my brief to interfere in areas which other hon. Members represent. However, as one who was born in Grimsby and spent most of his life in the area, I hope that the hon.

Certainly in the past these areas provided a barrier rather than a unifying factor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept everything that has been said but for one thingâ€”the bridge. When there is that community, one finds a similarity between the northern and southern sides of the river which may make a difference in quality. I do not want to go at length into the question of the Thames.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my right hon. Friend agree that a bridge in itself does not necessarily mean that one would group both sides of the estuary in one local government authority? The classic example is the Severn Bridge, linking the Principality of Wales with the City of Bristol.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>496</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had that argument with the Minister on other occasions. One does not choose the English Channel as being a grouping of areas. In this case the existence of the bridge is the joining together of two areas which by geography would be closer and by their social evolution more likely to form one unit. It is a quirk of geography that they are not joined. The Dartford Tunnel brings the north and south of the Thames together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the facts of history are against the thesis that rivers divide. It is not so. If my right hon. Friend cares to go back 2,000 years he will find that Caesar's legions came along the chalk wolds and reached Barton-on-Humber. They then ferried themselves over to what is now North Ferriby. So there is South Ferriby on the south bank, in Lincolnshire, and North Ferriby on the north bank, in Yorkshire. Today, that is the site of our bridge. We shall go over that bridgeâ€”over the same line of movement which Caesar and his legions followed 2,000 years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I yield to no one in my admiration both for Julius Caesar and for my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson), but Caesar did not build the Humber bridge. I should not have allowed myself to go too far into this argument. I was merely wondering whether enough thought had been given to an estuarial county in other areas. This may be out of order, so that I think, Sir Stephen, that I had better stop long before Caesar did and long before I reach the Humber.

I understand the importance my hon. Friend attaches to metropolitan county status for Humberside. If he is right in his predictions, and I hope that he isâ€”I hope that it will be happy and prosperous, populous and compactâ€”one day metropolitan status will come. In the meantime, the Minister's offer is fair and, within the context of what my hon. Friend and I believe to be a thoroughly unsatisfactory Bill, it is the best that he can offer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) does not often cast himself in the role of a midwife, but his speech has given birth to thoughts of a future baby which is still only a twinkle in the eye of the Ministerâ€”this is the future metropolitan authority of Humberside. I firmly believe this, although I did not expect the Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>497</span>
to give us this Amendment. What we have done is plant this thought in a fertile bed inside the Minister's head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there could well be co-operation between authorities. He accepts my view that even after the bridge is built, there will still be difficulties with communications, difficulties in welding together this new authority. I accept his assurances. I accept his courteous attitude to the whole debate. He has been most helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman reaches the end of his speech, I may have to interrupt him and destroy something which he was about to say. May I therefore deal with two matters raised by the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin)? He talked about estuariesâ€”Merseyside, Tyneside, Tees-side, Humbersideâ€”I do not want to carry it too far and perhaps be caught at Plymouthâ€”but certainly this is a conception which we have borne in mind in deciding to bring in both sides of the estuary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this example of Humberside will show that we have laid down in the Bill two forms of local government, the metropolitan county and its districts, and the non-metropolitan county. We have necessarily had to put in the Bill the areas
	<span class='label label-info column'>498</span>
to which these terms now apply, but I hope that we have shown by this debate that these are two forms of local government to which any area may become appropriate in due course. This may help us in further debates on the Schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's defenceâ€”he has all the guns and probably all the ammunition. I accept that his criterion of population is perfectly sound. At the moment the Humber is nothing like the two banks of Tyneside or Merseyside. If we have two million people by the end of the century, we will only reach the level of Tyneside as it is now with Hexham and Tynemouth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not expect the Minister to accept my Amendment. I thank him again for his courtesy, I thank him for the thoughts that he has given us, and I hope that later we shall see action.

In the light of what the Minister has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
