<div class='page-header'><h1>LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL</h1></div>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Stephen. You will recall that at the commencement of our proceedings last Thursday my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John) referred, in his opening point of order, to the fact that the draft proposals for the electoral divisions in the Welsh authorities are now coming out. He drew attention to the fact that though the Press had received copies, and that there was one copy in the Library which was making it very difficult for hon. Members to obtain information from it, we were given an assurance by the Minister that he was sending every hon. Member in the Committee a copy and that that copy would appear as fast as possible. By now surely we should have received the draft proposals so that we can advise those of our constituents affected by them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Richard Sharples)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for the delay. I am getting them out as fast as I can. I hope to have them all out either today or tomorrow. It is simply a case of the machinery inside the Home Office. We are working as fast as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. May I suggest to the Minister that if there is some difficulty, hon. Members might have some absolute priority in the areas which directly affect them? The Glamorgan issue is one which is of concern to many of the Welsh Members, but there is no immediate hurry about some of the other areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rather than looking at each scheme and relating it to the particular hon. Member concerned, it is easier to go through the whole lot. I had hoped to get them all out last night; they were not quite ready, so I hope to be able to send them out today.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1280</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Stephen. In col. 1228 of the OFFICIAL REPORT for Thursday, 3rd February, 1972, towards the end of my speech, I am reported as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"This Bill is not designed to reform the structure of local government."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee D,</i> 3rd February, 1972; <i>c.</i> 1228.]</p></blockquote>
That should, of course, refer to London government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will arrange for that to be corrected. Perhaps we may now proceed.</span></p>

Clause 48</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOUNDARY COMMISSION FOR ENGLAND</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brynmor John</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In rising to speak on this Clause, I want to make a protest about the way in which the Government have handled this question of the Local Government Boundary Commission. It is interesting to note that consistently we in the Opposition have urged that the date for the implementation of this legislation is too soon, and will not allow sufficient time for the necessary preparations to be made to set up this body.<br><br>
We have been told by the Government, equally consistently, that there is no need to concern ourselves at all, that there is plenty of time. However, the Local Government Boundary Commission, in attempting to fulfil the deadline that they themselves have set, have been led into some fairly strange practices.<br><br>
We are now asked to accede to the proposition that there shall be a Local Government Boundary Commission for England, but this is an absolute and utter farce, because we all know that the Local Government Boundary Commission, admittedly with the tag "designate", has already been set up. We are now being asked to sanction something that was in being as long ago as the first sitting of this Committee.<br><br>
As far as I can see, until Clause 48 and the seventh Schedule have been sanctioned, there is as yet no authority for the Secretary of State either to set up this Commission, or to expend any money on its task, but nevertheless the fact is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0698">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1281</span>
that on 25th November, 1971, the Local Government Boundary Commission designate was set up. It has held seven meetings since that date. It has already employed a staff, the annual cost of which will be £15,000 per year. It has rented accommodation at an annual rental of £6,000 per year. It has sanctioned salaries which will commence from 25th November, 1971; the chairman is paid £7,000 per year, the deputy chairman £2,000 per year and the members £1,500 per year, it has already expended money for postage, lighting and has already paid the members of the Commission expenses in travelling to these meetings.<br><br>
I believe that the setting up of this body by the Government, without any statutory authority whatsoever, without this Clause standing part of the Bill, without this Committee having had any opportunity of discussing it or of commenting upon it, shows a flagrant contempt for this Committee, and a protest ought to be registered this morning.<br><br>
If you, Sir Stephen, and hon. Members will refer to the Seventh Schedule, you will see that the words there throughout are that
<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission shall be a body",</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>There shall be paid to each member … such salary … and allowances ",</p></blockquote>
and yet we know that already these things are being done.<br><br>
Before I am prepared to sanction, I want to know why this has been done. Why has it been felt necessary, in order to keep up with an artificial timetable and an artificial deadline which the Government have set themselves, that this body should be set up and commence work without statutory authority? I hope the Minister will be forthcoming with his answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, a commission designate has been set up already as an advisory committee to the Secretary of State. It has been set up as any other advisory body is set up by Ministers when they seek advice from outside their departments. There was no need for any formal move to herald the establishment of the Commission designate, but the Secretary of State took care to ensure that the Commission was not set up until after the House had approved
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1282</span>
the general principles of the Bill on Second Reading.<br><br>
This is a convention of the House, that if it is intended to set up a commission or an advisory body under a Bill, the House shall accept the principles of that first and then the commission shall be merely an advisory body taking no formal steps until it is constituted as a legal body under the Bill when it comes on to the Statute Book.<br><br>
All the present actions of the Commission are administrative and informal. They are taking written representations from local authorities. If it should be necessary to meet any local authorities in particular cases after the written representations have been received, this will be done in informal conferences and not by statutory public inquiries of any sort.<br><br>
I should have thought that it was businesslike of the Government to have an advisory committee like this at this stage in the discussions on this Bill in order to keep to a timetable which is certainly not an artificial timetable, as the hon. Gentleman said. It is clearly a timetable which is tight, and the Government have always said that the timetable will be difficult to keep to. Once one has embarked on this kind of reform, surely it is better that one completes it without unnecessary delay, unnecessary disorganisation and anxiety, particularly amongst local authority staff, even more than amongst local authority members.<br><br>
We are dealing here with a large body of men of the greatest importance to this country. I am anxious that they should not be left in doubt any longer than is necessary. If we waited until this Bill received the Royal Assent before starting any sort of discussions on the working of the legislation, I think the Government would be culpable of neglect of both members and officials in local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While appreciating wholly the anxiety of the Minister to see that time is not wasted, are there not some dangers about this? What must concern us in this Committee is that we may make some Amendments in the Bill which might affect the way in which the Commission is to work. If that be so, might it not mean that evidence would have to be retaken and that some of the work carried out would prove valueless?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0699">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1283</span>
Is it not to some extent prejudging its work?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I readily agree that there is that danger. My own estimate is that it is about a 5 per cent. danger, but 95 per cent. of the work which they are undertaking now will prove valuable. I admit they are assuming that the House may agree certain things in the Bill, and then find that the House may disagree in the end, but it may be that 5 per cent. of their work will have to be looked at again. For that 95 per cent. it is worth having an advisory body of this sort to get on with the work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should, with respect to my hon. Friend's point of view, like to deal with another point, namely what will happen after the Boundary Commission is statutorily in existence, when it has received, as is known in the courts, its legitimation <i>per subsequentum matrimonium.</i> [An hon. Member: "Who is it marrying?"] Marrying the Minister! I think we would all agree that the Boundary Commission, when it is statutorily in existence, should be independent, that it should be free from interference, but willing always to listen to sensible representations that are made to it.<br><br>
For that reason I recommend to the Minister of State, Home Office, that the same procedure be followed as is followed in the case of the Parliamentary Boundary Commission. The position here is that the Parliamentary Boundary Commission, from time to time, consults all the major political parties, and when it publishes a fresh set of proposals, it has already met them and it meets them afterwards; it sends them four copies of the provisional proposals several days before publication, and the same applies when it revises or modifies proposals. Finally it sends to the main parties copies of all representations received, details of any local inquiries and a copy of the Deputy Commissioner's report and his recommendations.<br><br>
This has been a procedure that has been adopted for many years. In the Parliamentary Boundary Commission's Report for 1969, Cmnd. 4084, para 23, page 3, this is what they have to say: It is headed "<i>Discussions with Political Parties".</i>
<br><blockquote><p>"In 1942 the Committee on Electoral
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1284</span>
Machinery (Cmd. 6408) suggested that, apart from local inquiries held under the statutory arrangements, each Commission should also sit under its Deputy Chairman</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'… to hear any representations from the Chief or National Officers of the principal Party organisations with respect to the provisional proposals.'</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>It was made evident in the House of Commons during the Second Reading debate on the 1958 Redistribution Bill that the three principal parties were anxious to see the suggestion adopted. Indeed the leaders of the parties wrote to the Chairman of the four Boundary Commissions expressing the hope that the Commissions would be prepared to implement it. We adopted the suggestion and a meeting with the chief officers of the parties represented in the House of Commons was arranged shortly after the announcement of the general review."</p></blockquote>
This is an interesting comment:
<br><blockquote><p>"A further 7 meetings were held with the chief officers as the review proceeded. We found these periodic discussions on our progress and procedure most helpful."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, it would seem that this was the right thing to do with the Parliamentary Boundary Commission. I submit that we ought to carry on much the same procedure for the Local Government Boundary Commission.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to consider carefully what the right hon. Gentleman has said. So far as the electoral arrangements are concerned, I should like the same kind of consultation with the political parties. The Commission itself should decide how to carry out its work and what recommendations to make. In general, I am in sympathy with what the right hon. Gentleman has said.<br><br>
With regard to boundaries, consultation would need to be with local authority associations. I take the point made by the right hon. Gentleman that it is a matter for consideration and consultation with the Boundary Commissioners. I am grateful to him for raising the matter.</span></p>

Amendment No. 520, in Clause 49, page 25, line 17, leave out "principal" and insert "local government".<br><br>
This Amendment to Clause 49 is a paving Amendment for the group of Amendments which we are discussing at the same time. They all cover the same ground as new Clause No. 2 standing in the name of the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison).<br><br>
The effect of my Amendments and new Clause No. 2—and, in a rather different way, the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop)—is to ensure that early in the new structure of local government there is a full review of the whole of England to set up parishes more or less on a par with the communities in the Welsh section. I must not trespass on the debate which we have had already on the merits of the communities for the whole of urban areas where at the moment in England they are restricted to rural areas.<br><br>
It was agreed when the Committee discussed that part of the Bill that there was a need to keep this matter under close attention. The provisions of the Bill dealing with the parish review could be strengthened greatly to ensure that this is not something that may or could or would occur if districts made proposals, but that there was something mandatory, either in the way proposed by the hon. Member for Devizes and myself, by means of obliging the Boundary Commission for England to follow a course similar to that laid down later in the Bill for the Boundary Commission for Wales—that is, to have a special review of the whole of England as soon as is practicable after 1974 to set up parishes throughout the kingdom, both in the rural and the urban areas—or in the way proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields in his Amendment, to put an obligation upon the districts to carry out such a review of their districts and designate parishes within them in urban and rural areas.<br><br>
No doubt, my hon. Friend will speak to that method of carrying out the operation. I urge that there is much to be said, here as elsewhere in the Bill, for following closely in England the provisions which exist already in the Welsh part of the Bill. The Schedule for the special community review in Wales is most excellent. Although in Wales the urban
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1290</span>
districts and small boroughs will be made into communities as they stand on 1st April, 1974, it is clearly important that soon after that there should be a review of the whole country—admittedly, with the exception in Wales of certain existing large county boroughs—of as much of the country as possible, to set up communities of a proper nature. I believe that this would also be valuable in England.<br><br>
In earlier debates, we have seen that a third tier of government, at community level in Wales or parish level in England, could fulfill a very important function. That function, as has been pointed out, can be fulfilled much better by an elected body than by voluntary bodies which may spring up, purporting to represent the electorate but not necessarily doing so particularly well.<br><br>
I therefore hope that the Government will be well disposed to the Amendments, which will ensure that following 1st April, 1974, as soon as is practicable, the English Boundary Commission will undertake a review of the whole of England to set up parishes not only in rural areas but also in the urban areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support what the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) has said. The main object of the Amendments is to ensure that there is a special parish review. Before dealing with that subject, I should like to ask the Minister of State to take note of Amendment No. 276 which, although a small one, is not unimportant. At present the Bill, it seems, empowers a district council to create voids in its parish system. Clearly, that would be unfortunate. Amendment No. 276 would cope with the situation. Of course, the situation might not arise if the main objective of the Amendments and new Clause No. 2 were accepted by the Government, since they would ensure that there would be a special review from the beginning in the same way as is the intention in Wales.<br><br>
I think the Minister will agree that it is important that from the outset every part of the country should be brought into a parish council system. Even now, a large number of parishes are not in the existing parish council system. I am informed that out of a total of 10,800 parishes, 3,200 at present have no parish council. Furthermore, a number of other anomalies need to be ironed out, many of which have existed for centuries. If
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0703">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1291</span>
the new system of local government is to get off to a good start, as I am sure the Government intend, it seems sensible that at the grass roots of the new system, in the parishes, there should be a system which covers the whole country and is recognisable to every person in every parish.<br><br>
I therefore hope that my hon. Friend will be able to accept either the Amendment put forward by the hon. Member for Farnworth or alternatively new Clause No. 2. I am biased in favour of new Clause No. 2 because it is rather shorter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the initiative of the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) and also the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) in raising the general point to which I personally am very much attached; that is, the whole question of ensuring that there shall be an effective system of parishes in both our urban and rural areas. I put down the Amendments that I suggested we might take at the same time because I felt that the Committee should have before it an alternative method of reaching the same conclusion. Under the series of Amendments in my name the requirement is clearly placed upon the district council by a certain date to make proposals, but with the power for them to be reviewed by the Commission if the district council did not act or was felt by the Commission to have acted in an unsatisfactory way.<br><br>
The object is exactly the same in both sets of Amendments and, if the Minister preferred the proposals of my hon. Friend, I should not press my own Amendments. It is a matter for decision which seems the most practicable. If the Minister wished for a further opportunity for consideration between now and Report, to discuss it further with his Welsh colleagues because of the close relation of our two sets of Amendments, that too would be reasonable and understandable. But we cannot have the present position, which is full of anomalies.<br><br>
I joined with friends, both within the House and outside, in promoting the concept of what we then called neighbourhood councils, two years ago. We were interested to find what wide interest and support came from all parts of the country and all political quarters. There
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1292</span>
was a real feeling that that kind of organisation was needed. When we found that proposals were being made in the Welsh section of the Bill that met our objectives, we found it impossible to understand why they had not been adopted throughout the country as a whole. I believe that something of the sort is intended for Scotland, too, although that has not been finalised in the same way.<br><br>
We may be told that it is legally possible for that to happen in odd places under the provisions of the Bill as they stand, but without any kind of timetable or organisation, and with no certainty that a real offer will be made to people living in such areas.<br><br>
It is, I understand, still the intention of the Bill as a whole that we should try to bring together our procedures in both rural and urban areas. I thought we were realising today that on the whole the divisions are not as sharp as they used to be, and that therefore the idea of parish, which has been thought of largely as rural, has more and more grown to be understood as something applicable to urban areas, too.<br><br>
Indeed, as has been acknowledged over these last years, many of the most active and successful parish councils have been in either urban or semi-urban areas and in areas that have been overtaken by our cities as they have grown. Therefore, it is peculiarly anomalous that the proposals as they stand now do not recognise this fact, and that while in some parts of the country there will be parishes in largely urban areas on the fringes of our towns in other parts not very different in their character there will not be parishes, even though local people may demonstrate clearly that they want them. It has been suggested to me—some of my hon. Friends from the Principality will be able to tell me whether it is true—that in Wales the distinction between rural and urban areas is clearer than it is in England. Therefore, one could say that the need for this kind of organisation to apply both to urban and rural areas is even stronger in England than it is in Wales. Certainly it is no less strong.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
We shall be interested to hear what the proposals are to be for Scotland. It would be quite an extraordinary situation if both in Wales and Scotland this pro
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0704">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1293</span>
vision were accepted and welcomed, because I think my hon. Friends will regard at least that part of the provision for Wales as admirable, and in England I think that we should recognise the importance of this and accept the leadership of our friends in Wales.<br><br>
Very wide support for this concept has been demonstrated from a large range of official and unofficial bodies. A body like the A.M.C.—and I declare an interest as being one of the vice-presidents of that body—put forward in the early stages of their evidence to the Maud Commission comparable proposals—not precisely the same as these in Wales but the intention was very much the same—to meet the need as they put it, for a new demand for expression and participation right at the grass roots level. They have supported it.<br><br>
The Royal Commission, in its recommendations, made proposals which were inadequate from my point of view, but nevertheless it was trying to meet this case and I am sure we would have developed it. Experiments are being carried out in different parts of the country which show the value of this and the welcome it has received. Extensive surveys have been undertaken in many of our towns which again show that there is considerable eagerness for this kind of provision. Therefore, I find it incredible that the Government have not, long before this, taken the opportunity of introducing proposals on these lines. I think we have at the moment the worst of all worlds. We have all the makings of a major mess, where great confusion can be created.<br><br>
I therefore hope very strongly—because of the relaxed attitude that the Minister has taken on quite a number of matters in the past—that in view of the quite clear all-party view about the matter, in view of the strong support which we welcome from his Welsh colleagues, which is bound to exist because of the provision for Wales, the Minister will not resist a warm-hearted appeal to him to make this very considerable and healthy breakthrough into a new democratic start with this kind of provision. I hope that the Minister will respond.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In these two sets of Amendments we are dealing with two subjects related to the parishes and communities.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1294</span>
First of all, we are considering an undertaking which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary gave earlier that we would look into the question of continuity of parishes and towns, perhaps giving the smaller towns a parish status. Undoubtedly there must be a review undertaken fairly quickly if we are going to give continuity to existing parishes and small towns which may take over parish status on 1st April, 1974. Secondly, we are considering under these Clauses in Part IV the general review of parishes which will be undertaken by the district councils.<br><br>
So far as Amendments 525, 526, 527 and New Clause No. 2 are concerned, I see their effect as being that we should provide in England for an initial review of parishes by the English Commission, not by the district councils; that is similar to the initial review of communities by the Welsh Commission. As in the case of the Welsh community review, the English parish review would take priority over the reviews of electoral arrangements of districts and counties which is already provided for in Schedule 9.<br><br>
I am assuming that this takes place in the general form of reviews undertaken by the Commission rather than the special form of setting up these parishes and towns with parish status before April, 1974, which is the point mainly dealt with by the Amendment of the hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop).<br><br>
Dealing first with a general review, which is considered in the Amendments of the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper), there are two questions here; first, who is to do the job? Second, at what time in the deliberations of the Commission or the district? The sheer scale of the problem in England makes a review by the Boundary Commission at an early stage impossible. My hon. Friend mentioned that there were 3,200 parishes which have no parish council; there are some 10,000 parishes in England. This suggests that the burden ought to be divided amongst the districts rather than given to the Boundary Commission at this stage when it has a considerable volume of other work to undertake.<br><br>
That brings me to timing. The parish review in England will obviously take a considerable time. There are 10,000 parishes and in a large number of cases it will have to be considered whether they are to have councils or retain their parish
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0705">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1295</span>
meetings. Meanwhile the first election to the new counties and districts will have to take place under the provisional electoral arrangements, and it is important that these should be replaced as quickly as possible by proper electoral arrangements for the second elections. I think hon. Members will agree that the prime duty of the Boundary Commission must be to get the electoral arrangements right. I am sorry that we have to start the first election off on provisional arrangements, and I should like to see the Boundary Commission getting to work on the permanent arrangements as soon as possible. It is not realistic to think of this happening in England if the parish review has to come first.<br><br>
I could not advise the Committee to accept the Amendments of the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper), nor my hon. Friend's new Clause, although the points which have been made in support of those Amendments in the new Clause will be taken into account when at a later stage we bring before the House, our proposals for the first setting up of parishes and towns with parish status.<br><br>
This leads me to the Amendments of the hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop). As I see it, the effect of these Amendments would be to require the Secretary of State to direct English district councils to carry out the review by 1st April, 1975. He leaves the job to be done speedily by the district councils under the direction of the Secretary of State in order to decide whether to recommend parish councils in areas which are now covered by boroughs or urban districts. He says that the whole review, including the Boundary Commission action, is to be completed by 1st April, 1977. The district council is to have regard to local wishes, history and civic tradition. I am sure that every district council will have regard to that.<br><br>
This is one way of attacking the problem of continuity of representation for urban areas, but it will not provide complete continuity from 1st April, 1974. This is what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary undertook to do, or at least he undertook to see whether we could work out the machinery for continuity right from 1st April, 1974, so that the small towns about which we debated so much at various stages will be able to have some status within local government. We
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1296</span>
undertook that the Government would consider the whole question and that we would return to it on Report. We have not had time to bring it before the Committee in any detail. I ask again for the time to deal with it so that we may bring it back on Report.<br><br>
The present proposals of the hon. Member for South Shields do not go nearly as far as I thought hon. Members would wish in the previous debate. They do not provide that full continuity. I promise him, however, that I shall certainly take into account not only his Amendments but the very interesting way in which he addressed them to the Committee. I shall take them into account in the course of the review which is now proceeding as to how we can achieve that continuity as from 1st April, 1974.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If anything were needed to illustrate the total lack of a logical principle in the Bill, it would be Part IV. If one argues that local government means local democracy, that one must get nearer to the people, that one must allow the people to be more involved in local government, that one must abolish the distinction as far as one can between town and country when it comes to. local government, if one believes all these things to be fundamental principles, then Part IV is where one can put them into effect. What is interesting about the Minister's reply is that he says that he will look at the matter again between now and Report, in the most general terms. He nowhere—and I do not think that I am doing him an injustice—expresses a total committed sympathy to the idea. He says that he understands that on both sides of the Committee there are people who feel that the parish councils ought to be more uniform and universal, that it should be a fundamental precept of the Bill, and that he will look at it. Quite clearly he is himself not convinced about it. I think it will be wise to go over again, as briefly as possible, the reasons why we believe that he should immediately think again and become a little more committed in his approval of parish councils.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
If there is no thread of principle going through the Bill, it must equally be true that it is a practical, expedient Bill, and, therefore the fewer anomalies it contains
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0706">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1297</span>
the better. The anomalies are, however, present.<br><br>
Consider the matter in practice. There will be some areas which will be served by parish councils and some areas which will not. What, then, will happen in the functions of those areas, as, for example, recreation, trusteeship of charities, support for voluntary groups, meeting places? In some cases the financial provision for these will come out of the district rate, but in other cases it will come out of the parish precept. If that is not a positive reason for future complaints, I can think of nothing more likely to be. As the Bill stands, this is not dealt with in any way.<br><br>
This is not the only anomaly in the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth very clearly pointed out the situation in Wales. Indeed, the hon. Member for Devizes makes this explicit in new Clause No. 2. Of course, there is this anomaly between Wales and England. My hon. Friend the Member for South Shields states that if one says that, as far as urban parishes in England are concerned, there is a clear distinction between an urban and a rural parish, then, as far as Wales is concerned, the distinction is even clearer. I think he must be right.<br><br>
As I understand it, the Government's proposals for Scotland are also more liberal than they are for England. I do not wish to trespass on the preserve of my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East (Mr. Lamond)—I regard him as the Scottish expert on this Committee—but I think that he will agree with me. There is a very clear distinction between town and country. One expects that. In those areas where there is such a clear distinction, there will be urban parish councils. But not so in England.<br><br>
One is puzzled by that anomaly. Why is there this difference? My hon. Friend the Member for South Shields pointed out very forcefully that there are urban parish councils today which are completely successful. One may have them in highly industrialised areas. In fact, if one looks at it logically, one might expect that here there would be a greater interest, a greater and more powerful participation of people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I can assist the right hon. Gentleman in this. Would he refer
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1298</span>
to Clause 50(7)? This imposes on the districts an obligation to review the whole of their areas, whether urban or rural. I call that to his attention because I think it is relevant to his argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree. I hope that I will not be too prolix if I say that that forms the second part of what I was going to say. I should like to examine that with the Minister when I come to it.<br><br>
I wanted, first, to set the scene, and then to see whether the Minister is coping with the situation in his Bill. I do not want to repeat the arguments that were used earlier on Clause 1 when we talked about the Golborne Ward neighbourhood council, or even my own Telegraph Hill neighbourhood council, of which I am parentally rather proud. But the Minister's argument, as I understand it, is that the Boundary Commission must not be overburdened, as it will be if the provision of the new parish councils is put on its shoulders: that is its task. I think he used the words, "The sheer scale makes it impossible." But does not the argument apply even more to the district councils? The Minister rightly pointed out a moment ago that, under Clause 50, the district councils would have to undertake a review; but when? We are not told. If it is true that the Boundary Commission might need to take on extra staff, if it were to do the review that my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Devizes have in mind, how much more is it true of the district councils?<br><br>
I have always been worried—though, after the Minister has spoken I have always been reassured for at least 24 hours, as he is very persuasive—about how they will meet the staff problem in certain other aspects, in planning, for example. But I am even more worried about how they will find the extra staff to provide the review that the Minister has in mind. I believe it will be even more burdensome to them individually than it would be to the Boundary Commission, and would involve even more duplication—I cannot think of a collective word for duplication throughout the country, but it is a duplication of effort; and, whereas the Boundary Commission would have, under the scheme of my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth—here I rather differ from my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields—an incentive and duty to carry on and make such a review, there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0707">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1299</span>
is every temptation for the district council not to do so. Though the Minister in Clause 50 may tell them to do it, he has very wisely, from their point of view, not told them when to do it. Does he not accept that there are district councils, to put it no higher, which might not welcome the establishment of parish councils in which they might well see a rival to their own power and authority?<br><br>
All of us in local government have said from time to time that local government is about power, and the parish council is to an extent a rival in the sense that it takes, or ought to take, some of the powers away from the district council. I do not think, therefore, that they will be as keen as all that, and they will have a perfect excuse. If any of us question them, as the years go by, they will say that the Minister did not tell them when they were to provide such a review, that they are terribly understaffed, and how are they expected to cope with it? I do not know what the answer to that will be. I think that the Minister is putting too much responsibility on the district councils. I am sorry to disagree slightly with my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields,—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend need not worry too much. I am not completely devoted to this proposal, but I ask him to take account of the fact that it includes both a time limit and the provision that the Commission will review what has been done and, if necessary, act themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. Friend has put in much clearer language what I was about to say. I regarded his Amendments as going a good deal of the way towards the solution of the problem. The only thing his Amendments do not solve is the question of the rivalry between the district councils and the parish councils, though he may argue—and I can see the force of it—that this joint move might have the same result as I should like.<br><br>
I am not so certain, and in any event I do not think that my hon. Friends the Members for South Shields and for Farnworth, or the hon. Member for Devizes, are so committed to their own particular draftsmanship. I thought the hon. Gentleman was very fair in his attitude to it. What they are really concerned with is a principle, and what they want is the establishment of parish councils
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1300</span>
throughout England, as it is proposed they will be in Wales and in Scotland. They want this by the best method possible. I thought the Minister did not give sufficient weight to the difficulties that will arise if he hands the problem over to district councils (a) who may not be willing to solve the problem in this way, and may resent it, (b) who have no time set down statutorily in which to conduct such a review and (c) who may be burdened by appalling staff difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was rather disappointed by the Minister's reply to my Amendment. I appreciate some of the points that he made, and I should like to try to deal with them in the hope that after second thoughts he might come forward with a rather more committed position on this Amendment.<br><br>
I accept that if my Amendment or that of the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) were accepted, this would imply an increase in the staff requirements of the Boundary Commission. I accept that completely but, as I pointed out, if this job is to be done, staff will have to be employed somewhere. I believe—and I hope to be able to show—that it is better that it should be employed by the Boundary Commission in doing this rather than by the district councils. The Minister said that it would be impossible to do this.<br><br>
All that is asked in my Amendment No. 526 to Schedule 9 is that it should be "as soon as practicable after 1st April, 1974".<br><br>
I do not think one can say that something which merely says "as soon as practicable" is impossible. Perhaps that is too linguistic a point, but, in any case, I do not think the Minister can maintain it is impossible for this to be done by the Boundary Commission. I admit that it requires an increase in the staff of the Boundary Commission, and it would be difficult for it to do it with its present basis of staffing.<br><br>
However, the much more substantial point which the Minister made was the question of relative priority in England between this work, reviewing parishes, and reviewing electoral arrangements. I take the point which he made that there is a problem. Many of us have complained that the arrangements for the first elections are somewhat <i>ad hoc</i> and somewhat unsatisfactory, and involve a certain imbalance between different areas.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0708">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1301</span>
It is perfectly true that my Amendment No. 527 to Schedule 9, which implies priority being given to the special parish review over the review of electoral arrangements, puts this problem to which the Minister referred. At this stage I am not moving Amendment No. 527.I should be very happy at the appropriate time not to move Amendment No. 527, which implies this priority to the special parish review over the review of electoral arrangements, if it were possible in the light of that assurance for the Minister to give a more favourable response to the remainder of my Amendments. I should be quite happy for the review of electoral arrangements to take priority over the special parish review. We know that inevitably the review of electoral arrangements must be carried out by the time of the next elections, and therefore it must be done reasonably quickly. If the special parish review could follow immediately after that, that would satisfy me and I think it would satisfy other hon. Members—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend forgive me for a moment? One thing that has always worried me about these priorities and the difficulties that are apparent is that, curiously, they do not apply to Wales, where apparently it can be done perfectly simply—so simply that it is provided for in the Bill but not in England.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is, of course, quite right, but I have always appreciated that the Welsh have certain abilities which we do not share, and this must be assumed to be one of them. I am glad that although I have been deserted by some of my hon. Friends for Welsh constituencies, the Minister of State has returned and perhaps will support me in my tribute to the ability of the Welsh in these matters. I share the view of my right hon. Friend that it would be preferable for this review to be carried out by the Boundary Commission rather than as my right hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) suggested, by the districts. The Commission will be an independent body, and the expertise that it gains in one part of the country will enable it to do this job of dividing parishes better elsewhere.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1302</span>
The hon. Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones) said in an earlier debate that devising criteria for the parish boundaries was very difficult. The Boundary Commission working on a national basis would be able to develop professional skills in defining parish boundaries for urban areas for the country as a whole which districts would find much more difficult. My right hon. Friend's second point was that there might be some reluctance from the districts to create bodies which could be rivals for themselves. I suspect that this is one of the reasons why some local authority associations have not supported the proposals for the creation of parishes in England as strongly as they have supported some other Amendments to the Bill. They do not wish to see the development of this third level of local government. I hope that the Committee will continue to press for its establishment as soon as possible.<br><br>
I hope also that the Minister—even if he is not able to respond as favourably as I would like to this group of Amendments—will give us a much clearer answer on one particular question. He has talked about the commitment which his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has given to look again at urban parishes in England. Will he give us a commitment that the proposals which the Government will bring forward on this matter on the Report stage will include specific and particular provisions for a review of urban parishes in England?<br><br>
I would not be satisfied merely with prolonging the existing municipal boroughs as urban districts. We wish to see the development of a system of urban parishes throughout England similar to that in Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear that yet again in the reply of my hon. Friend the Minister of State I detected an underemphasis on the part of the Government as to the importance of parish councils and the parish council system. Putting on one side administrative convenience, the ordinary man in the village street is only concerned with the lowest level of local government, namely, the parish, or the community, or the housing estate.<br><br>
It is of great importance right from the beginning of a new system of local government to ensure that there is proper coverage of established parish councils;
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0709">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1303</span>
otherwise the new system will not get off to as good a start as it should, because above that level everything is there for administrative convenience and for good administration. That is important, but in the end it is all done on behalf of individual people, and this should not be forgotten by my hon. Friend.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) called in aid by implication the Minister of State for Wales. If I were the Minister of State for Wales today, my thoughts would be limited solely to the magnificent win by Hereford over Newcastle last Saturday. Nevertheless, in spirit we should have support for these Amendments from the Minister of State, because fundamentally there is no difference between Wales and England in this matter. What is good enough for Wales should also be good enough for England. As the hon. Member for Farnworth has said, if this review is undertaken, more staff will be required.<br><br>
I would argue strongly that such staff should be taken on in the first instance by the Boundary Commission. This is not an insuperable problem, because there are a large number of highly experienced retired local government officers who would be genuinely interested in this relatively short term job to help the Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would agree that there might be a saving of staff if the Boundary Commission had a special department to deal with this, rather than if each district council were to run up its own staff to deal with it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman, because if the districts engaged staff Parkinson's Law would tend to operate, and, having taken on the staff, they would find that there was work available to fill their time even after they had finished the review job. Also, as I said in respect of an earlier Amendment, the constitutional oversight of parishes in the view of the Government must now go to the districts rather than to the counties who have been responsible up to now.<br><br>
This means in practice that the district councils, if they were responsible for this initial review, would be taking on new staff in respect of a totally new sphere of responsibility. There would be no basis of knowledge contained within the district
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1304</span>
councils which would be immediately available to consider this type of problem. This is another strong argument in favour of giving the responsibility to the Boundary Commission right from the beginning.<br><br>
Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend will be a little less tepid when he speaks again on this subject, and that he will accept that there is a very strong argument in favour of this initial review, and that he will come forward with more direct and sympathetic proposals when we reach the Report stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) has made a most reasonable case to the Minister. I was very disappointed by the Minister's remarks. He has not hitherto given the impression of being in the pocket of his advisers, but clearly his own judgment will tell him that he is being unreasonable in his reply. If the Government look at local government in Wales and consider that this is the best system, unless they are going to accept the basis of separation of Wales from England, they must see the logic that what is good for the communities in Wales in the rural areas or in the outskirts of the urban areas is also good in England.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) paid tribute to the Welsh people. It is well known that Welsh people are very modest, and we are accustomed to these compliments. We take them in our stride.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be pleasant if they were occasionally reciprocated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is asking a lot. He must wait until we deal with the Welsh Clauses. My right hon. Friend has reminded me that it was Gerald Cambrensis who taught Alfred the Great to read. We who have the honour of speaking for Wales hope to persuade the Minister to read some sense into the proposal that he has submitted to the Committee. It is grossly unfair that parish councils in England should be at the mercy of district councils, who will not start off with good will towards them. Nobody believes that, uniformly over England, district councils will treat the parish councils as the Bill proposes to treat them in the Principality of Wales.<br><br>
The Minister is wrong to say that this principle must be brushed aside for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0710">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1305</span>
administrative convenience. He will regret it if he offends against a sense of natural justice, which parish councils in England feel is offended by the different treatment afforded in the same Bill. We have often been told that Wales had to be included in this Measure because the general principles of local government were the same in England and Wales. The Government cannot have it both ways. They must accept that if the basic premise is true—that the Welsh Bill had to be included in the English Bill—the basic principles which apply to parish government in Wales must apply to parish government in England.<br><br>
Now that the Minister has had the further opportunity of listening to the arguments advanced by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, I am sure that he will not be stubborn. We have all done our best to be helpful. I hope that the Minister will realise that we shall be able to make progress if he reconsiders this matter and brings forward on Report proposals to provide a greater uniformity in the treatment of parish councils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene only briefly, to try to clear up one or two points. I accept the strength of the argument of my hon. Friends who are anxious about the position of the district council in relation to the parish. That is why I inserted the other Amendments in my name, which ensure that the Commission reviews the position, to try to make sure that if the district councils act in the unsatisfactory way that some of my hon. Friends fear the Commission can step in. I do not stand by that. I would have welcomed the acceptance of the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) that the direct responsibility should fall upon the Commission.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
We all want from the Minister a clear acceptance of the underlying principle. We have not had that clear statement—which is unusual for him. We have had a number of comments explaining the difficulties of some of the precise proposals that we have made. Some of these difficulties may be genuine, and we should be prepared to discuss them. We want from the Minister a clear acceptance of the view that provision must be made to enable urban and rural parishes to be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1306</span>
established where they do not exist at the present time. We want some kind of date system to ensure that the proposal has some reality.<br><br>
We do not ask for more than that. We understand that there may be practical difficulties here. The Minister has said that in a certain limited number of cases the proposal contained in Amendment No. 627 would withdraw somewhat from the kind of cases that the Ministry has already agreed to examine. I do not want to take anyone backwards; my intention was to bring people forwards. But the examination undertaken so far covers only a limited type of case. It deals with certain types of communities stranded in a rural city, if that is the right way to put it, and where there is the problem of continuity.<br><br>
We want to establish the further point that we are concerned to ensure that parishes not only can, but will, be established within some reasonable time limit in urban areas generally and in rural areas where they exist already. This is a different wider point of real significance. In this regard, up to now the only assurance we have had from the Minister is a reference to the importance, in his view, as an alternative, of voluntary <i>ad hoc</i> bodies. We are saying that this will not do. We want a clear declaration from the Minister that he accepts the principle of the elected body as a parish in urban and rural areas throughout the country and some reasonable procedure by which that can be set up.<br><br>
If the Minister will agree to that principle, we can agree about the detail, perhaps later. We understand that there are problems involved. Certainly, I do not stand by the Amendments in my name as ideal. Some of the difficulties have been illustrated already. We should be willing to try to find a more satisfactory solution, but we should not be willing to accept merely the statement that this would be inconvenient or that there would be staff problems. Of course, we should try to find a system which would cause as few problems as possible, but we are not prepared to accept that statement.<br><br>
Above all, I want an assurance from the Minister that he is with us on the broad principle that we are trying to establish. There, I am sure, we can make progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I add my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0711">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1307</span>
advocacy to those who dealt comprehensively with the question of the existing parish councils and the concept of extending the idea of parish councils into urban communities.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) reminded me that I was an advocate of this earlier in our proceedings. My life has been lived in a small county town, and I know the loyalties that there are there, not necessarily to the town as a whole, but to certain areas of it. We should, therefore, consider building up a small unit of local government autonomy on that basis. On principle, when local government in England and Wales is under review we ought to look at the lowest unit, in order to keep community decisions as near to the man in the street as possible. We have that with the parish councils. I know that they are by no means universal throughout England, but this is where the advocacy lies for giving them a proper basis on which to carry out their functions and for setting them nation-wide throughout England.<br><br>
Having settled the procedure the concept could be put into operation over a period of years. I take the point of the hon. Member for Farnworth. He is not pressing for immediate implementation of his proposal. He is providing a reasonable time scale for the implementation of the principle if it is accepted by the Government. I hope that they will accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Several hon. Members have complained that I did not commit myself sufficiently in dealing with the Amendments. I thought that I had gone a long way to commit myself. My hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) said that I was tepid. I shall try to be a little warmer about it, and a little clearer.<br><br>
Let me say first to what I am not committed. I am not committed to any other form of grass-roots local governmen than the parish as we know it. I cannot commit myself to phrases such as neighbourhood councils, which are ill-defined. They may be the right thing when we know what we are talking about, but I want to talk about parish councils, the parish as we know it in local government, and how we may apply it further than it is applied at present to the parish in the rural districts.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1308</span>
I am not committing myself to having parishes for every town, or, indeed, for every part of a town or an urban district. To a great extent the larger towns will have sufficient influence within the district council. Their populations will be sufficiently compact not to require any separate grass-roots local government—applying the word parish to the urban district. In many cases it will be desirable to have a form of parish within the urban areas, but I do not wish to commit myself or, indeed, the coming districts to setting up a parish for every inch of their districts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify what the Minister is saying. I do not want to impose a system on people who clearly do not want it. I want to ensure that where there is a demand for an association of this kind—I do not mind what it is called: urban parish, neighbourhood council, or what one likes—it can be set up and have an elected body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All right. I shall commit myself as far as saying that if there is a wish for it it is to be considered, as the Bill stands, by the district council, or, as the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) would prefer, by the Boundary Commission. The desire for that in any area must be considered, but again I cannot commit myself to the specific time within which a review will take place. We have determined, by the drafting of the Bill, that a review to decide what areas shall have parish status shall not drag on indefinitely, and for that purpose we have given the Secretary of State power to issue guidelines to the district councils and, in specific cases of default, to go even further and refer the matter to the Boundary Commission so that it can recommend the parishes for a district.<br><br>
We have provided the long-stop, and I am not prepared at this stage to say that this shall be done within a specific period. There must be flexibility, whether it is given to the Boundary Commission or the districts, over the question of time. There is the long-stop that the Secretary of State can be called to account in the House for not giving the guidelines, or for not taking the power, where a district is defaulting, to refer it to the Boundary Commission.<br><br>
What I am committed to can be put under three headings. First, under the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0712">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1309</span>
Bill existing parishes will automatically continue. That comes under Clause 1(6). We are fully committed to all the existing parishes, subject perhaps to mergers or splits, as are provided for in Clause 1. Secondly, by Clause 50(7), to which I called the attention of the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin), I am committed to the duty of the districts to review the whole of their areas, and in that subsection there is no distinction between town and country, rural and urban. The districts are put under a duty to review their areas for the purpose of deciding which parts shall have parish status, and again the Secretary of State will have power to give directions about that.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. George Thomas), in talking about the difficulty of getting the districts to show good will towards their areas which ought to have parish status, said that I was brushing aside an important principle. The important principle to me is to give district councils the right to govern their own areas. I believe that the new responsibility which we are giving them to decide how their areas should be divided into parishes will be exercised enthusiastically by them. I do not believe that there will be any niggling by the district councils, or a fear on their part that if they set up a parish they will be attacked, or that pressure groups which will, as it were, be sticking pins into them, and so on. I think they will accept this responsibility.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Cardiff, West, said that I was speaking from a Civil Service brief, and not using my own judgment. I assure him that it was my own judgment that the districts should have the right and responsibility to set up their own parishes, but I may be wrong. I am willing to look at it again to see whether the Boundary Commission can be organised to take on this responsibility, but I believe that as a matter of principle districts should be given this task. If they default, the matter can be referred to the Boundary Commission.<br><br>
The first two matters to which I am committed are in the Bill. The third matter is the undertaking that, in the meantime, we are continuing the study of the possibility and the method of providing in advance for continuity for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1310</span>
existing boroughs and urban districts. The right size to adopt in choosing boroughs and urban districts to be given parish status is still under consideration and discussion. The Government have given the undertaking that they are studying the possibility and the methods of providing them in advance.<br><br>
That is a clear undertaking. It might solve the problem whether it should be the Boundary Commission or the district which should undertake any further review after the initial review, which we hope to have by the time the Bill comes into effect. When we see that, we may be able to decide whether, in future, reviews should be carried out by the districts or by the Boundary Commission. If we are able to give parish status and continuity to many of the smaller towns within the small boroughs and districts, the review after that may be very much shortened. We could then perhaps consider whether the Boundary Commission or the district ought to undertake it, but as a matter of principle, I should still prefer the districts to govern their own areas.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
There is a clear acceptance of principle by the Government for the continuity of boroughs and urban districts and the intention to have a general review of parishes not dragging on indefinitely. If the Committee feels that we have not provided for those principles fully within the Bill, then I should wish to look at it again. I do not claim that the Bill is perfect in the way it deals with the issue, but there are the undertakings I have given, and there are the intentions of the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We may be said to have narrowed the gap between the two sides of the argument down Clause 50(7) and first, its interpretation and, secondly, its implementation.<br><br>
The Minister says that under Clause 50(7) there is a duty for the districts to review the whole question. That is true, but if one reads this subsection very closely one sees that their duty is:
<br><blockquote><p>"… to keep the whole of their district under review for the purpose of considering whether or not to make recommendations to the English Commission for such proposals with respect to the constitution of new parishes, …"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0713">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1311</span>
though they can abolish or alter them as well. They then have to consider
<br><blockquote><p>"… what recommendations, if any, to make and the council shall, unless to do so would in their opinion impede the proper discharge of their functions, consider any request …"</p></blockquote>
The first point arises on the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"the council shall, unless to do so would in their opinion impede the proper discharge of their functions".</p></blockquote>
I do not think that by those words the Minister meets the point which is germane to the arguments of the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) or those of my hon. Friends the Members for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) and South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop). I must, therefore, ask the Minister to consider strengthening language of the subsection by deleting the words "in their opinion" and substituting "in the opinion of the Secretary of State", or, even better, "in the opinion of the Boundary Commission".<br><br>
The second matter is the time factor. I think that we all understand the Minister's difficulties. He says that he does not want to be committed to time, that he wants to see how things work out, and he referred to the Secretary of State as a long-stop. I think that he will be a very long-stop because the Secretary of State can come into the picture only after many years of inactivity. If the Secretary of State were then to say to a district council that it should have engaged in a review to see whether it should have parishes in their area, the council could, according to Clause 50(7), carry out its review within three days and say that to have parishes would
<br><blockquote><p>"impede the proper discharge of their functions ".</p></blockquote>
The provision must be strengthened to the extent of having the Boundary Commission giving the say-so, with a time thereafter. I can see that the Minister does not want to be tied to an initial time but I should not have thought that a period of five years would be tying him too much. After a district council has been informed by the Secretary of State, or by the Boundary Commission, that it ought to conduct a review, a time limit should be set for that. During that period the Boundary Commission would have the right to challenge what was being done and, if necessary, itself take over the duty of creating such parish councils.<br><br>
If the Minister is willing to go at least
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1312</span>
as far as promising to consider the matter between now and Report, I shall advise my hon. Friends to withdraw their Amendments. To be brutally frank with the Minister, if there were a Division now I do not know whether he would win it, or I would. It would be a close-run thing. I should prefer sensible thoughts to prevail between now and Report, particularly since the Minister has come a very long way towards meeting our case. It is only this last faltering step that I wish him to take, then sun, benevolence and kindness can shine all over the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I never take faltering steps. I shall step out boldly and firmly and say to the right hon. Gentleman that I entirely agree with both the points that he has made. The phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"in their opinion impede the proper discharge of their functions"</p></blockquote>
was intended to refer their functions in reviewing under Part IV, and not under Part IX or later in the Bill. There may be a way of putting that right and not giving the discretion entirely to them, though I still wish to give the districts a very wide discretion in the decision on the division of their own areas into parishes. I shall consider the matter from the point of view of restricting the word "functions" to the functions of district councils under this part of the Bill and not relating it to their general functions as they would be given a very wide discretion if it referred to all their functions.<br><br>
The second point was on the timing. It would be appropriate to consider a period of time following a Secretary of State's direction to district councils to carry out a review. I agree that we should consider that to see whether an appropriate provision can be introduced to deal with it.<br><br>
I have gone as far as I can to meet the arguments from both sides of the Committee, so forcefully put, and with most of which I agree. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that it would be unfortunate if there were to be a Division when we are so near to agreement and when I have given so many undertakings to look at the matter carefully before Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of those assurances, and in the hope that there will be some constructive Amendments from the Government on Report—if there are not that we shall reintroduce some of these Amendments—I beg to ask leave to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0714">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1313</span>
withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin Maddan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 777, in page 25, line 20, leave out paragraph (<i>d</i>).<br><br>
I hope that we can discuss this Amendment in minutes, compared with the quarter of an hour spent on the previous Amendment which was complicated by many diverse views and different factors.<br><br>
Paragraph (<i>d</i>) enables the Boundary Commission to recommend the conversion of a metropolitan county into a non-metropolitan county, or <i>vice versa.</i> It is not that I do not foresee the need for that to happen. It may well happen, but there are some aspects of the method, both so far as the Commission is concerned, and what is consequential upon it in the Bill if it is done in this way when the matter comes before Parliament, which need re-consideration.<br><br>
The first point is that of all the paragraphs in subsection (1), from (<i>a</i>) to (<i>i</i>), paragraph (<i>d</i>) is an odd-ball. The other paragraphs deal with things like areas. Paragraph (<i>d</i>), which recommends the conversion of a metropolitan county to a non-metropolitan county, or <i>vice versa,</i> is different, affecting, as it does, the transfer of such important functions as education and the social services. So the first thing is that the Boundary Commission will not be well versed in those aspects. It will come across them very rarely. The second thing is that if it makes a recommendation, as it stands under the Bill it will be for the Government to implement that recommendation by making an Order. I am not quite certain—perhaps the Minister could enlighten us—whether it would be subject to the positive or the negative procedure. Either way, it would be impossible for Parliament to amend that Order.<br><br>
In these Committee proceedings we have been making many changes in the Bill—changes in Schedule 1, for instance—which the Minister has accepted, and I think we all agree that these will lead to improvements in the local government structure. When the Boundary Commission has made a recommendation in this particular field of changing the status of a county, metropolitan or non-metropolitan, again Parliament will, I have no doubt, have a real contribution to make in con-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1314</span>
sidering not only the principle but the detail of the matter.<br><br>
By leaving out this paragraph, the the matter would have to come before the House by means of a full Bill subject to discussion at all stages in both Houses of Parliament. If the Minister cannot accept that, I hope that at least he will tell the Committee that he will at a later stage introduce Amendments which will make it, in practice and not just in theory, possible for Parliament to have a voice and to put suggested changes in a way which the Government will be able to accept without loss of face such as would happen if they were defeated on an Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must tell my hon. Friend right away that I cannot accept his Amendment as it stands. The whole purpose of the Bill is to lay down a form of local government for the future. Although we have dealt in Schedule 1 with the way in which that form of government will be applied to the country as it is now, I do not see that as being permanent. The whole point of Part IV of the Bill which we are discussing is to prevent the local government system from being frozen into the pattern which suits the pattern of life and development at this moment, or in the very near future that we can foresee. I am sure that over the years we shall find that one district or another will move from one form of government to another, will move from the metropolitan to the non-metropolitan or from the non-metropolitan to the metropolitan type of government.<br><br>
What my hon. Friend would wish is that if that is to be done, if there is to be that movement of an area from one form of government to another in the county sphere, then it should be done by a Bill coming before Parliament and all the elaborate process of legislation through Parliament. The Bill as it is drafted provides for that change to take place after consideration by the Boundary Commission, after a recommendation by the Boundary Commission to the Secretary of State, and after the matter has been brought before the House by an Order made by Statutory Instrument which would be subject to negative resolution in the House. So it would have that parliamentary procedure for debate in the House.<br><br>
I hope the Committee will be satisfied
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0715">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1315</span>
that by that means, the change, which is a very important change if it has to take place between metropolitan and non-metropolitan status or the other way round, will be brought before the House and there will be the opportunity for the House to debate it.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may not need my support here, but I want to say plainly and distinctly that I see much merit in the words he has just uttered. On Humberside, for example, with our changing population, I can foresee us wishing to utilise this particular subsection. So I support the Minister in saying that I am perfectly happy with this, and if and when the times comes we shall certainly utilise it. He has persuaded me that there will be safeguards in the future in the way that he has outlined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy with what my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson) said. Clearly, as he pointed out to the Committee, in Clause 49(1)(<i>d</i>) we are not dealing just with areas; we are dealing with status. All the other paragraphs in Clause 49(1) deal with areas and not with status. This is very different.<br><br>
As far as I can see, the operative procedure comes under Clause 50(1) which says that the English Commission shall review within a period of
<br><blockquote><p>"… not less than ten or more than fifteen years after 1st April 1974 …"</p></blockquote>
the position with regard to not just the areas but the status of metropolitan districts and non-metropolitan districts.<br><br>
It is all very well for the Minister of State to say that under Clause 53, on the implementation of the Commission's Report, this will be done by the Secretary of State, by means of a Statutory Instrument, which the House can deal with by the negative procedure. The point of the hon. Gentleman's Amendment is that the House may not wish to annul the whole Statutory Instrument, but they are not, under the negative procedure, able to amend the Statutory Instrument, particularly with regard to the boundaries of the place concerned. This means that although the Commission has some power and although the Minister has some power, effectively unless this House decides all-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1316</span>
or-nothing with regard to that Statutory Instrument, there is very little we can do about it. I have a great deal of sympathy with the hon. Gentleman and I think the Committee should be grateful to him for pointing this out, as it may have escaped the notice of some hon Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maddan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will think again. I do not want to put obstacles in the way of the conversion of a county to a metropolitan county, but I think the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson) may be able to foresee the position that what the Boundary Commission recommends and what the Secretary of State lays in an Order before the House may not include some details, some parishes which he thinks it ought to include, or <i>vice versa,</i> and he, as the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) has just said, will then be faced with all-or-nothing.<br><br>
One must either throw away the whole loaf or swallow it whole, but one cannot change its shape at all. I do not think that is right. Having listened to the debates on Schedule 1 and other parts of the Bill, I cannot persuade myself that Parliament and hon. Members of Parliament will not have their own contribution to make, and they ought to be able to make it without throwing away the whole loaf, which is the danger.<br><br>
I therefore press my hon. Friend the Minister to consider a procedure whereby he lays a draft Order before the House which could be debated quickly, not taking a great deal of time, not necessarily taking prime time at 3.30 p.m. or anything of that sort, in which hon. Members could make their points in public for the Minister to hear and consider and perhaps take and amend the Statutory Instrument before he finally lays it. I fear that the procedure under the Bill will put hon. Members in a very difficult position indeed, an all-or-nothing position. I hope my hon. Friend will reconsider what he has said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr John</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister has held out to us as being parliamentary control is more illusory than real. In recent years under the negative Resolution procedure, fewer and fewer of the Orders laid before Parliament which are subject to this procedure have been scrutinised. The Committee on Statutory Instruments has been very critical of the procedure. Many of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0716">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1317</span>
the Orders were made out of time or debated only after they had come into operation; they are not subject to amendment, as the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan) has said. The Minister is trying to persuade the Committee that this is good enough. I do not believe that this is so. He ought to consider the affirmative Resolution procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are debating a matter of fundamental local importance. I know full well that many who are active and experienced in the field of local government feel strongly about this. I endorse everything that was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan) to urge the Minister to think most carefully about the draft Order suggestion which he has just made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As some hon. Members will know I am in an extremely embarrassing position, as ex-Chairman of the Statutory Instruments Committee, who, on the other side of Committee, fought desperately for the affirmative Resolution procedure on every possible occasion. I now find myself gamekeeper turned poacher, pleading for the negative procedure in this case.<br><br>
I do not think that the argument about being unable to amend a Statutory Instrument can weigh heavily. This is a recognised form of procedure in the House, and there have been many occasions on which it has been necessary to refer to a very minor point in a Statutory Instrument on a Prayer; the Minister in charge has found that the argument was good, has withdrawn the Order and has produced it with that slight amendment. I remember that the previous Speaker used to tease me about one debate in which I debated on a comma being in the wrong place in a Statutory Instrument. It was not accepted then, but a few weeks later, the Minister had to issue an amending Order and put the comma in the right place. So it is possible to have Amendments in that form on the negative procedure in the House.<br><br>
I think that in this case one can rely to a great extent on the recommendation of the Boundary Commission and the publicity which that recommendation will have. In later sections in Part IV, there are elaborate precautions for publicity, for reports and the recommendations to be available to the public and to be debated
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1318</span>
publicly long before they reach the stage of being embodied in an Order by the Secretary of State.<br><br>
I believe that we have got the procedure right, with a negative form of procedure before the House. But I will not be dogmatic about it, and if my hon. Friend or hon. Gentlemen opposite can produce a precedent of a similar type of Order by the affirmative Resolution procedure, we will think about it again. At the moment I think we are right, but if I ask to be allowed to think further about it, as this is an important recommendation of the Boundary Commission, perhaps my hon. Friend will allow me to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maddan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 651, in page 25, line 43, after "in", insert "this Part of".<br><br>
This is a drafting Amendment, to make it clear that the words "substantive change" occur only in this part of the Bill, to save people looking through the rest of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 652, in page 25, line 44, leave out "desirable on the merits" and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"independent of any change in local government areas so proposed".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the Amendment is to clarify the meaning of "substantive change" in the electoral arrangements. It is intended to mean that it is a change independent of and not consequential on a change in local government areas. The kind of example which I might give to the Committee is, perhaps, if a local authority requested permission to review the electoral arrangements for a principal area, as they have powers to do under Clause 52(4).<br><br>
Another example is where there have been no changes in the boundaries of a principal area but the electorate has changed. It has, perhaps, declined in one part of a district and increased in another part by, for instance, the development of a new housing estate. The purpose of the Amendment is to make clear

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1319</span>
the kind of change which is envisaged in this subsection.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ray Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 792, in page 25, line 45, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>i</i>) the drawing of parish boundaries within a district so as to give electoral parity between one parish and another.</p></blockquote>
The Amendment closely follows the arguments that were laid before us this morning, concerning the re-drawing of parish boundaries within the new or existing district authorities. Although the Minister assured us that he would consider all the points made and decide whether or not the Boundary Commission or the district council should consider the boundaries of parishes within it, one ought to bear in mind that there is an inherent weakness in allowing the district council to carry out this function since, at the present time, there is a principal known as rural weighting, which gives power to rural parishes. These far outweigh the powers of urban areas within a district authority.<br><br>
The purpose of my Amendment is to ensure that, within a district authority, all parishes have parity with one another, for we must remember that, as far as elections to the district council are concerned, representation is based on the parish and its size.<br><br>
It is said by the rural parishes within a district council that rural areas should have a different form of numerical basis from that of urban areas, because they are more difficult to administer. I disagree with that and have first hand evidence to support my disagreement.<br><br>
People in rural parishes, smaller in number as compared to urban areas, have far more contact with one another; the community tends to be of a more cohesive nature than an urban parish, and the problems of representation are, in my experience, far less than in an urban area. To show the consequence of this maldistribution of representation in the present rural areas, I will give as an example the rural district council of which I was a member for six years, which had within it a new town, Bracknell New Town, surrounded by half a dozen rural parishes, all very small—the biggest numbering just a few thousand. The new town was sited within the parish
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1320</span>
of Bracknell, and over the years it grew to a point where, today, it probably provides about 70 to 80 per cent. of the revenue of the total rural district. But because of this practice of rural weighting, the rural district councillors of Bracknell could always be outvoted on issues which they thought were in the vital interests of the Bracknell community.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
To give an example, the rural district council had over a period of 10 years a massive programme of installing surface water drainage and sewerage facilities in the rural area. That programme was possible only because of the existence of the new town of Bracknell within the rural district authority. I and other members were quite happy to go along with it because we thought of ourselves as a part of a total town and country authority, and we felt that the citizens of Bracknell who had been lucky enough to find homes in a rural area should play their part in bringing rural parishes up to the same standards of the urban areas; but when at a later date the urban area of Bracknell wanted to provide for itself amenities and recreational facilities which demanded a heavy level of expenditure, the rural parishes would not go along with this at all, even though the town of Bracknell was providing about 60 per cent. of the revenue of the total rural district authority. The parish of Bracknell could not get its way because it was outvoted.<br><br>
In the new arrangements, I would like it to be possible for towns like Bracknell to obtain more nearly what they want in terms of facilities without being hindered by the rural weighting as at present. This problem will be increased after the passage of the Bill, because many towns that are at present boroughs will become parishes and therefore merely a part of a larger district authority.<br><br>
The problems of new towns are now small in number, but with the passage of the Bill and the growth of a large number of district authorities, with large urban areas in the middle of them, the problems will increase, particularly in the Home Counties, where a number of small borough towns have become centres of urban development. They are all right as they are; they manage their own services very well, and they take note of the grow-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0718">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1321</span>
ing and changing needs of communities which have suddenly expanded. However, these authorities within the new district councils may not be able to convince people in the rural parishes outside that their needs are just ones, which the total community should service.<br><br>
The Minister said that he would look more closely at the way in which parishes within district councils are drawn up in future. I would be prepared to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment in advance of anything that the Minister might say, because I feel that there was some willingness on his part to meet the points made. I urge him to recognise that the principle of rural weighting causes a feeling of deep resentment on the part of urban areas such as new towns in existing rural district authorities. If rural weighting continues in the future, even though the Minister might allow district authorities to determine boundaries it will still be possible for a district authority to say "No" to an urban area. We want to see a greater sense of justice and more democracy, and in that spirit I ask the Minister to accept the Amendment, or the principle lying behind it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the effect of the Amendment would be to require equality of electorates as between all the parishes in a district to be the criterion of parish boundaries. That would be rather too egalitarian, and would make a nonsense of our attempt to give parish status to some smaller towns. The need for achieving equality of electoral areas is already accepted in the Bill. Schedule 11, paragraph 1 (2) (<i>a</i>) provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"So far as is reasonably practicable—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(a) the number of local government electors shall be, as nearly as may be, the same in every electoral division;"</p></blockquote>
That applies to the counties; the same applies to the districts under paragraph 3(2), which provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"So far as is reasonably practicable the ratio of the number of local government electors to the number of councillors to be elected shall be, as nearly as may be, the same in every ward of the district or borough."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, in counties and districts we have tried to obtain equality of electoral areas. To go one step further—as this Amendment would—and say that we must draw our parish boundaries so that each parish has the same number of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1322</span>
electors would make the position extremely difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was not my intention. I want to achieve a numerical relationship between the number of councillors elected to a district council by a parish and the number of electors in the parish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he requires. Rural weighting will not be a principle of local government reorganisation. There may not be exact equality in the electorate, or exact evenness in the warding, but it certainly will not be a principle of local government reform to apply rural weighting. We shall try to get the electorate right in each area.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Member will accept that assurance and not ask us to draw parish boundaries on this basis. For parish boundaries we shall need to consider community interests and local ties and wishes. Some parishes may have large numbers of electors—perhaps 20,000—or may be quite small, with populations of only 200 t.o 300. To try to tie electoral parity to parish boundaries would be wrong. But in terms of the basis of the reform we wish to move away from rural weighting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 522, in page 26, line 10, after (1)(<i>b</i>). insert "and (<i>c</i>)".<br><br>
It has been drawn to my attention that in the event of this Amendment being accepted the word "subsection" in line 10 on page 26, should read "subsections". If the Amendment is accepted, Sir Stephen, I hope that you will accept a further manuscript Amendment to change "subsection" to "subsections".<br><br>
This is a probing Amendment, to discover why, in subsection (4), where the Government make an interpretative statement that:
<br><blockquote><p>"metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties are areas of a like description and so are metropolitan and non-metropolitan districts."</p></blockquote>
That should apply to subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), but not to paragraph (<i>c</i>). Paragraph (<i>b</i>) deals with the constitution of a new local government area; paragraph (<i>c</i>) deals with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0719">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1323</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"the abolition of a principal area of any description … and its distribution among other areas of the like description."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps when a local government area is abolished it will not be necessary to give some parts of it to a metropolitan district and some to a non-metropolitan district. It would therefore seem tidier if subsection (4) covered both subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>)</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) said that this was a probing Amendment.

DUTY AND POWER TO REVIEW LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS IN ENGLAND</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 736, in page 26, line 14. after "Commission" insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"in respect of the boundary between Greater London and the counties adjoining it within one year after the passing of this Act and in all other cases".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we can take Amendment No. 737, in page 26, line 15, after "and", insert "in every case".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our proceedings last Tuesday give added significance to the wording of these Amendments. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary then said:
<br><blockquote><p>"In drawing the Bill we have tried throughout to maintain a hard frontier on the issues of constitution, structure and election as it applies to London."</p></blockquote>
Our debate showed clearly that the effect of the Bill was intended to apply in certain respects to the area of Greater London. Local government reform under the Bill does not exclude London. We
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1324</span>
were dealing at that time with the question of aldermen on the Greater London Council, and my hon. Friend accepted the proposal for the abolition of the alder-manic principle in London. He eventually agreed, as I understood it, that there should be an exception in principle, but that its implementation should be delayed. He said that the proposal would be examined:
<br><blockquote><p>"for a delayed implementation which removes the argument of the work-load which has seemed insurmountable …</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"I hope that the concession on a major democratic principal will not be called in aid as we go through the Bill."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee D,</i> 1st February. 1972; <i>cc.</i> 1166–1167.]</p></blockquote>
Certainly, if we alter the aldermanic situation in London significant repercussions are bound to flow from that decision. I referred in my speech on those Amendments to the work load in the G.L.C. It would present great difficulties in manning the committees and carrying the tremendous load of decision-taking and executive responsibility on the G.L.C. if the existing number of aldermen were to disappear.<br><br>
If the work load is to be satisfactorily carried, further councillors will presumably need to be put in their place, perhaps with an expansion of the membership of the G.L.C. as a whole. That, in turn, is bound to put in question the reorganisation of the electoral boundary system in the whole of Greater London; that is inescapable from the situation in which the Government say that they are prepared to see the disappearance of aldermen from the G.L.C, although they give no time scale but refer to a "delayed implementation".<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
The present boundaries of the G.L.C. are defined in the London Government Act, 1963, which stemmed from the report on the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London, 1957-60, known as the Herbert Commission. The area reviewed by the Commission comprised the whole of what was regarded as the built-up area of London, with its boundaries ranging from Rickmansworth and Watford in the north-west through Cheshunt, Chigwell, Hornchurch, Dart-ford in the east, Orpington, Caterham, Banstead, Esher in the south, to Sunbury and Staines in the west—a tremendous built-up area.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0720">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1325</span>
With certain exceptions, notably Watford, Potters Bar, Waltham Holy Cross and Dartford, the Commission recommend that its review areas should form the area of Greater London. Its main criterion in arriving at that conclusion was that the districts within the area had recognisable and strong ties to London, including the fringe areas which were more identifiable with the London conurbation than with the counties of which they then formed part.<br><br>
I am aware of the declared policy of the Government with regard to the review of the Greater London boundary, and I know that on the 19th March my hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr. Mather), in a Question down to the Secretary of Stale for the Environment, asked how the county of Surrey would be affected in plans to change the boundaries of the Greater London area. In reply my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have no plans to change these boundaries and I do not consider this the time to re-open the question of the extent of Greater London. This issue was settled by Parliament after full debate, and the present boundaries have been in operation for less than six years."—[OFFICIAL REPORT. 19th March. 1971: Vol. 813. c. <i>408.</i>]</p></blockquote>
The Greater London Act required that the whole question of local government in London should be reviewed in 1973, and the Clause purports to change that arrangement. It now provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"it shall be the duty of the English Commission not less than ten or more than fifteen years after 1st April 1974 … to review (<i>a</i>) all the counties in England…. all London boroughs, (<i>b</i>) the boundaries between Greater London and the counties adjoining it."</p></blockquote>
Under the Bill we are therefore faced with a change in the arrangements for a review of the area of Greater London.<br><br>
I turn to the criteria for boundary revisions and see to what extent they are pertinent to the present circumstances. It is acceptable that regard should be had to contiguous built-up areas where there is no clear physical separation between one authority and another. Although my knowledge is by no means extensive, it is fair to say that in many of the places which I mentioned earlier there is a continuous and indistinguishable built-up area comprising the G.L.C. area and some of the built-up areas adjacent to it. On that premise I think there is a case for a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1326</span>
review of the Greater London area.<br><br>
There is the other series of criteria relating to local communities, communication system and the effects of the administrative machine of the Greater London Council and the surrounding counties. I have here a list of pertinent factors which would need to be taken into the consideration of the boundary of the Greater London area—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman. Looking at the Amendment and reading the Clause, it seems to me that he is advancing the proposal that there should be a review within one year, as opposed to waiting 10 or 15 years. If that is the correct interpretation of the Amendment, the hon. Gentleman should address himself to why it should be one year rather than 10 or 15.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I am saying that there should be a boundary review, and I am advocating that it should be within one year after the passing of the Bill. I am emphasising the necessity, as I see it. for that review. I hope you will agree, Sir Stephen, that this forms part of my advocacy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not quite right. The hon. Gentleman is permitted to argue why it should be "one year" instead of
<br><blockquote><p> "… not less than ten or more than fifteen</p></blockquote>
and not the general question whether there should be a review, which is provided for in the Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Stephen. I am happy to be guided by you.<br><br>
In thinking about whether the review-should be within one year or
<br><blockquote><p>"… not less than ten or more than fifteen years after 1st April 1974 …"</p></blockquote>
I have dealt with the differing requirement that these proposals involve, that is that we were to have a review in 1973, and now that review may not take place. Therefore, I address my advocacy to what I see as the necessity for a review within one year.<br><br>
I have dealt with the proximity of built-up areas around the perimeter of the existing G.L.C. area. There is also the need to ensure that the best administrative structure for all the services of the G.L.C. is looked at in terms of whether it is best organised on the existing boundary structure or whether it would be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0721">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1327</span>
improved by an extension—and I do not propose to delineate or suggest how this should be determined—of the boundaries of the G.L.C. area.<br><br>
If one were to think in terms of the metropolitan police district, the London drainage area, the sewage facilities in the G.L.C, it would be seen that there is an overriding case for those services and others to be looked at as soon as may be—and the suggestion is within a year—to see whether it is not to the public advantage that the review of the Greater London Council boundary should take place within a year of the passing of the Bill.<br><br>
Housing is another important field in which the G.L.C. has unique problems. We all accept this. We have to decide whether it should be required to solve these problems within the existing boundaries, or whether it should be possible to build outside the G.L.C. area. This is possible at present under the powers which the G.L.C. has to acquire a site and build on it outside its area. Of course, there are the alternatives of the extension of the new town and expanded town proposals.<br><br>
There was a reference in the Press yesterday to the fact that the G.L.C. is considering proposals which involve further new towns and development schemes. Although there is some advocacy for allowing London to extend its housing beyond its boundaries, that is not a view with which I agree. I do not want the extension of built-up areas. The whole concept of the metropolitan county is that we should draw boundaries tightly.—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is on dangerous ground. Whether there should be housing outside a local government area is not an argu-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1328</span>
ment for whether there should be one year or
<br><blockquote><p>"less than ten or more than fifteen".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take your point, Sir Stephen. The urgency of the housing situation in London is such that it must be taken into account in considering when the review of the Greater London boundary should take place. I bow to your decision.<br><br>
So far as employment is concerned, there are substantial factors affecting those who live just outside the area of Greater London and work within the Greater London area. Here the transport policy of the G.L.C. must be pertinent-its responsibility for seeing that commuters get to their homes and to their jobs. I am confident that the wider responsibility which rests on the G.L.C. extends beyond the existing boundaries.<br><br>
I should like to refer to the Redcliffe-Maud proposals on local government boundaries in England. In its report of June, 1969, in paragraph 243, it said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Each local authority should be responsible for a continuous area that makes, so far as practicable, a coherent social and economic whole … and giving the authority the space it needs to assess and tackle its problems."</p></blockquote>
It went on in paragraph 291:
<br><blockquote><p>"For each metropolitan area, there must be a metropolitan authority responsible for the planning, transportation and major development group of functions throughout the whole area."</p></blockquote>
That puts succinctly what I was trying to say about the administrative responsibilities of the G.L.C.</span></p>
