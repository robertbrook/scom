<p><i>Amendment No. 2 proposed</i>—(<i>30th November</i>)—in page 1, line 10, leave out first "counties" and insert "provinces"—[<i>Mr. Blenkinsop</i>].</p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind hon. Members that with this Amendment we are discussing Amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 10, leave out second "counties" and insert "provinces" and Amendment No. 6, in page 1, line 12, leave out subsection (2).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Leadbitter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the conclusion of the previous Sitting we were questioning the Minister on his latest comments regarding the Crowther Report. We were at the point of suggesting to him that we were concerned about his latest comment in view of the fact that earlier references had been made.<br><br>
At column 113 my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister should tell us the Government's views on Crowther. When the Minister says that Crowther cannot affect the Bill, that presupposes a knowledge of Crowther."</p></blockquote>
This is the first point I should like to make. Because there was an important matter of principle involved in the Amendment regarding provincial councils, a knowledge of what Crowther was thinking, while the Crowther Commission was sitting, was important to us. We were concerned that the state of understanding between Crowther and the Government,' or a state of asserting a position regarding local government reorganisation in the mind of the Government, arising from a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 200</span>
consideration of the comments made by Lord Crowther himself, was important. At column 123 the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am astonished. I am certain that it could not have been preferable to the people of Luton."</p></blockquote>
The Minister then went on to comment on what my hon. Friend the Member for Small Heath had said, and stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"He must surely be aware that the work of the regional authorities as we see them at the moment and as they are working at the moment is a combined effort between the regional economic planning councils, bodies set up by the previous Government, and the standing conferences of local planning authorities. Therefore, the local authorities are part and parcel of what we see as the temporary regional administration of the present time until the Crowther Commission reports."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee D,</i> 30th November, 1971; <i>cc.</i> 113, 123 and 124.]</p></blockquote>
The second question is this. Arising from a preconceived posture regarding the outcome of Crowther, we now have the first contradiction—that is, an apparent assertion that Crowther will be accepted because of an expression of the present local economic planning councils becoming temporary regional administrative organisations.<br><br>
At column 153 the Minister again states:
<br><blockquote><p>"I think we must, however, before putting that structure in our government, await the recommendations of the Crowther Commission on the constitution."</p></blockquote>
That is more than an assertion; it is a statement of fact. The Minister was referring to the question of provincial councils as outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop). The Minister said that he is awaiting the recommendations before putting a particular structure into operation.<br><br>
At column 154 the Minister continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"Then, when we have the recommendations of the Crowther Commission, we can see what sort of structure is necessary between local government and central government."</p></blockquote>
This was a further example of another matter which concerns us. When the Bill refers to local government reorganisation, we find it quite illogical, if we have to await Crowther, not discussing the question of the necessary relationships between local government and central government. As a matter of principle we have asserted that the provincial council idea will make more sense if it is put in the Bill when Crowther reports.<br><br>
The Minister went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill does not provide for any form of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0118">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 201</span>
regional or provincial government, and deliberately so. As I have already said, we are awaiting the recommendations of the Crowther Commission on the constitution."</p></blockquote>
We now discover in this fifth illogical and contradictory statement that we are not talking about provincial councils, having regard to Crowther, but about something which the Minister refers to as "the constitution".<br><br>
At column 156 the Minister goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"This is something which we think may be developed in the future when we receive the Crowther Commission Report."</p></blockquote>
At column 155 the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I was describing what I might call an interim caretaker form of regional government adminisration. We have concluded that we ought not to decide this issue before receiving "</p></blockquote>
the recommendation of the Crowther report.<br><br>
I cannot imagine any more statements that could be made to impress upon the Committee that the Minister was waiting for the report to do something anyway. Whatever it was that he was intending to do is a matter of confusion, but what was clear in the Minister's mind was that he was intending to do something anyway. We should like to know, when Crowther reports, whether the principles of my hon. Friend's Amendment will be brought to bear; and, since this Bill will take some considerable time in Committee, surely there is enough time on our side to consider harmonising the reorganisation of local government from local government operational basis to a provincial structure, where the general strategy is the major function as we have described it earlier.<br><br>
Yet the Minister, in column 195, again disturbs us. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The right hon. Gentleman"—</p></blockquote>
that is, my right hon. Friend—
<br><blockquote><p>"complained that I had not given a suitable alternative. Surely it would be foolish for a Minister to give an alternative to the present form of regional administration without seeing the report of a Commission which is now deliberating."</p></blockquote>
At least he was more emphatic in that instance. He said that it would be foolish to give an alternative before the Report appears. Yet he is now doing a whole host of things before the appearance of the Report, so that his case falls to the ground. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it all ways.<br><br>
We are discussing a subject which will affect the lives of everyone in Great
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 202</span>
Britain—radical changes in local government. Yet the Minister, during four Sittings of the Committee has expressed so many different views that my hon. Friends and I feel bound to ask him to clarify the situation, in order that the Committee may proceed to Schedule 1 at a reasonably early date.<br><br>
The Minister further states in column 195:
<br><blockquote><p>"The right hon. Gentleman asked whether, if Crowther reported in favour of provincial councils during the period of the passage of this Bill, we would include these in the Bill. It would be extremely difficult to redraft a Bill of this size and to ask the House to consider it again on the basis of some other tier of government to be inserted. Whatever Crowther reports, none of us would be prepared to take away responsibility for large chunks of local government services and give it to a regional body. I think we are dealing more with delegation from the top rather than pulling out services from the bottom."</p></blockquote>
The Minister said, "Whatever Crowther reports,", thus sounding the note that the Government will deliberately have made up their minds before receiving the Report of the Crowther Commission.<br><br>
Therefore, we ask him, in all fairness, to consider the following observation. The Minister spoke of the difficulty of redrafting the Bill. What, then, is this Standing Committee about? What is the function of Parliament, and of the host of advisers available to the Minister, if not to ensure, on this fundamental matter affecting local government, that the Crowther Report, if it be in favour of provincial councils, will at least be taken into account? We cannot accept, at this very early juncture, the Minister's assertion that "Whatever Crowther reports," no redrafting can take place.<br><br>
I am quite sure, when we come to consider Schedule 1, that a considerable amount of redrafting will be necessary. Additionally, by the very nature of the Bill, it is necessary that there should be an extreme amount of good will on both sides of the Committee. I am not here to challenge the Minister and to place him in a corner: the only time when that occurs is when a Minister does it for himself. We are legitimately asking for clarification. Will the Minister accept from me, and from my right hon. and hon. Friends, that the Bill, by its very nature, is unique in the history of the last 100 years of Parliament, since it deals with a subject which affects all of us, on whatever side of the Committee. Therefore, rather than fight the Bill in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0119">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 203</span>
terms of votes—after all, one can be obdurate—I would rather have a liaison with the Minister on many matters in order that the interests of the various local authorities may be enhanced, rather than prejudiced by rigid postures.<br><br>
Finally, the Minister said, in column 196:
<br><blockquote><p>"I do not give an undertaking that anything further will be introduced into the Bill at a later date."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee D,</i> 2nd December, 1971; <i>cc.</i> 153–196.]</p></blockquote>
I have known the Minister for seven years. Without flattery, I would say that both sides of the House observed him to be, in opposition, a diligent, forthright fighter, who possibly sat through more late night Sittings than anyone else in his party. Indeed, he may have approached the record of the late Stephen Swingler, who had the tremendous task, similarly involving late night Sittings, of responsibility for the Transport Bill.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
It is because I know the Minister to be a man of this calibre that I am asking him now for some clarification, while assuring him that my right hon. and hon. Friends and I wish to proceed as quickly as possible to the Schedule. Can he at least indicate that he will review the various comments which he has made, not with a view to their complete withdrawal—I do not ask that—but in order that there can be a basis of understanding? Thus we shall be able to proceed with the details of the Bill in the assurance that there is a resilient Minister opposite, whose colleagues are prepared to respond, in order that the very many factors involved in the major principle of Crowther, together with the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Minister for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) may be considered with greater speed and efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Minister for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) said, it is our intention to proceed as quickly as possible. However, since the Committee's last Sitting, an important development has taken place—the Government's announcement of their plans for regional water authorities, which bear directly upon the issue under consideration. Obviously that development must be taken account of this morning, since this is the appropriate Amendment; it is fortunate that the timing coincided, so
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 204</span>
that these matters could be raised, even if only briefly.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend suggested, we are extremely disappointed by the Minister's reply last Thursday. It was a thoughtful reply, and we are grateful to him for covering many of the points that we wished to raise. Nevertheless, the Minister's reply on Thursday morning, and the further development that same afternoon concerning regional water authorities, illustrates that the Committee has reached what might be called a critical moment in the determination of the democratic control of major local authority services.<br><br>
Whilst we were grateful to the Minister for his reply, I hope he will not mind my saying that in effect we received no reply to the inevitable fact that we are seeing the development throughout the country of what my hon. Friend the Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Goronwy Roberts) calls mini-Whitehalls, which will exercise very considerable authority and power in determining decisions of importance on which the whole of the remainder of local government will have to rely. For example, in the field of financial priorities, in the determination both capital and revenue expenditure, information and decisions will be taken by the regional arms of Ministries, to which we have very little access.<br><br>
I find that this is causing the Local Authority Associations a great deal of concern, since they see that these effective decisions are being taken out of the hands of the democratically controlled institutions. As we have said in earlier Sittings, it will be no adequate substitute to say that these regional authorities will be responsible, through Ministers, to Parliament. So much of the work which they do, so much of the information and research upon which their decisions are based—the thinking which makes them accept solution A rather than solution B or C—will be conducted in private, without the knowledge of local authority representatives, and certainly without the knowledge of Members of Parliament. The age-old justification of the function of Parliament to make the Executive accountable to public opinion will be made very much more difficult as a result of these developments.<br><br>
The previous Administration, understanding and accepting the broad conclusions of the Redcliffe-Maud Committee, thought that a Commission should be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0120">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 205</span>
set up to look into this question. The Minister has told us—and it is a reasonable proposition—that it would be quite wrong to delay all Government thinking until the Crowther Commission has reported. However, surely it cannot be right to cast the whole pattern of local government for the next 50 years in a vacuum, as far as regional and provincial considerations are concerned? Yet that is what the Minister is asking us to do.<br><br>
We know the argument that Crowther has said there is nothing in the Bill which ought to inhibit him. However, some of us have grave doubts about that proposition. I am glad that tribute has been paid by both sides of the Committee to regional sports councils, which were a remarkable new development, which brought local authorities together. The success of regional sports councils has done much to answer the criticism that no two neighbouring local authorities could ever reach agreement on anything, since, in the case of sport, and regional and recreational planning, the regional sports councils have come together and planned in this way, and have sunk their differences for the collective good.<br><br>
However, my right hon. and hon. Friends all believe that it would be a major mistake to determine the future of local government in this country before seeing the conclusions of the Crowther Commission and before determining the great principle of the democratic control of the regional arm of planning and the regional arm of Ministries in this country.<br><br>
I move to the question of the regional water authorities because of the remarkable statement that was made on Thursday. The present position is bad enough in that we are to have regional government without regional democracy, but what is even worse is that it is now proposed to establish regional government in terms of water resources and the canal system, not on the basis of any natural, democratically organised body, but that it will not be organised on the geographical regions as we know and understand them. The newly proposed regional water authorities, as announced on Thursday, are not to be based on democratically elected, or democratically understood, geographical regions as they are at the present accepted in this country but are to be on the basis of a watershed regional authority.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 206</span>
In practice that means that the authorship of this plan owes more to the engineers than to the administrators. In essence, this is an engineer's plan. The engineers have a very important part to play in providing and purifying water, but it is the essence of the democratic system that we base our arrangements for government—whether national or local—on democratic accountability and not managerial function. The whole of the plan for the division of the water resources is a further illustration of moving the arm of government into the country in a manner in which it can have no meaningful democratic content.<br><br>
At first glance I believe we shall need to study the water proposals in further detail, but there will be opportunities to return to this matter.<br><br>
We must register the protest that we see in the proposed regional structure for the new water undertaking that there is a movement towards the same type of Government control on which all of our fears were based when putting this Amendment down on the Order Paper. It should be possible to organise our water resources on a regional basis and I am completely in favour of the Government's doing so, and this is a feature of their proposals which is welcomed on this side of the Committee. But to do so yet again in a way in which it will cause the greatest possible difficulty for representatives of local authorities to come together and exercise sensible regional control, and to have to do so under regional arrangements which are completely different from any possible regional or provincial government which Crowther might recommend, or which certainly future governments might wish to exert, means that yet again we are failing to grasp the opportunity to deal with regional and provincial problems once and for all in the long term interests of government, national, regional and local.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I have to say can be said very briefly and, I hope, very much to the point. I know that the Committee wishes to hurry along. I apologise, Mrs. Butler, for being absent last week and for missing what appears to me from scrutiny of HANSARD to have been a very useful debate.<br><br>
I thought that the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) posed a very central question in speaking to the Amendment.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0121">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 207</span>
He asked:
<br><blockquote><p>"… whether … there is a role for a structure of government above that of county and metropolitan areas and beneath that of…"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee D,</i> 30th November, 1971;<i>c.</i> 137.]</p></blockquote>
national Government level. He argued that a provincial body was a natural body, that it could generate its own initiative, and that it could generate local and regional pride. He instanced in some of his arguments—which I thought were very effective—how regional water bodies could help in the construction, say, of a barrage across the Wash or across Morecambe Bay. That particularly drew my interest because, as the Member for East Flint, my constituency is alongside the estuary and there is no doubt whatsoever that there is a distinct possibility that a barrage could be thrown across that estuary.<br><br>
Whilst I know that it is not in order to go into the details of such projects now, in North Wales there is proposed to be a new local authority of Flint and Denbigh called Clwyd, and I wonder whether, in that situation, that local authority could have quite the same weight as opposed to the very large—almost monstrous—creation on the other side of the Dee Estuary, the large Merseyside authority.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) that as far as provincial councils are concerned, a very critical moment has arrived in the development of control of major local government services. The issue of water is of paramount interest to Wales, our own country.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) weighed in with a very heavy argument concerning provincial councils, when he instanced the need for very effective strategic planning, for industrial development, for strategic decisions on land use and the co-ordination of higher and further education. He seemed to think that it was conceivable that a provincial council could be the means whereby bodies with these responsibilities could function more sensibly, and, from the way he put his argument, I am inclined to agree with him.<br><br>
Further to the argument in favour of provincial councils which I have noted—and of which I am not yet 100 per cent. in favour—it is a fact that the Association of Municipal Corporations, N.A.L.G.O., and the Town and Country Planning
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 208</span>
Association which are influential and respected bodies, have come out definitely in favour of such a situation. Even the Redcliffe-Maud Commission, from my reading of it, seems to agree on somewhat limited powers for provincial councils.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
One good reason why perhaps ultimately there will be provincial councils is that in the current situation, which I know the Government want to reform, the criticism is that local problems are too often too remote from Whitehall; yet they have to be taken there in the end for settlement or arbitration. This creates frustration and delay, and often a local county council will get blamed for something in which it is totally innocent. Ultimately, therefore, the electorate becomes apathetic.<br><br>
In this thesis for provincialism, therefore, there may be a very good case for saying, "Why do we not break down the unitary State into self-governing units?" I have said that I am not entirely in favour of that. I have not been wholly convinced, but it seems to be an increasingly powerful argument and may well be the way by which we can overcome some of the problems that we have noted developing over the last two decades in our local government system.<br><br>
On 2nd December the Minister made a remarkable speech in this Committee. He described what might have been called an interim, caretaker, form of regional government administration, but he concluded that he could not decide the issue of provincial councils until after Crowther had reported. Obviously, Crowther is of great importance to Wales, and none of us can prejudge what the findings will be. None of us knows what the Government will do with the findings of the Crowther Commission, although we may make some intelligent guesses.<br><br>
In Wales there may be a case for saying that support is developing for the concept of an elected regional council which some people might point to as being a sort of Welsh Parliament. However, I do not wish to consider this in detail, because obviously in the proceedings on this Very lengthy Bill there will come a time for that in the weeks or months ahead—I am not sure about years, but there will be much scope for discussion on the Bill.<br><br>
However, as a Welshman, I think that my hon. Friend's Amendment is very useful. In looking at the background on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0122">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 209</span>
this issue, I came across some remarks by the now famous Mr. Derek Senior. I quote from the <i>Local Government Chronicle</i> of 27th February, in which Mr. Senior is somewhat critical. Although he bases his remarks on the White Paper, they are opposite to the discussion we have had this morning. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The acceptance of the White Paper means making local government structurally incapable of tackling any of the major problems of a dynamic society throughout our own and our children's lifetime. It has taken 30 years of mounting frustration to create a climate of opinion in which radical reform is possible. Better, surely, to take a little more time—damaging though the delay would be—and get the answer more or less right than to waste this unrepeatable opportunity on a makeshift political compromise that will hamstring local democracy for generations to come."</p></blockquote>
That is relevant to the point, and I hope that the Minister will consider it very seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to speak again on the Amendment, because we have spent a great deal of time on it, but the Government's behaviour and conduct cause delay. For instance, as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) said, when we were discussing the apposite Amendment last week, on a Bill that is of vital importance to local government, the Minister did not reply at all to my points on the subject of water. Two days later, in the House, the Minister of State announced far-reaching changes regarding the administration of water on a regional basis throughout the country. It is astonishing that the Government are so incompetent that Clause 175 of a Bill on the future of local government, which the Secretary of State himself has said is a major Bill—a milestone for local government—says one thing about water and sewage undertakings, and during the Committee stage the Minister concerned makes a totally different statement in the House of Commons, while the Minister of State does not deal in Committee with the very points that have been raised on the Amendment concerning provincial councils which is the most appropriate Amendment.<br><br>
What the Government have succeeded in doing in their proposals for water is unique. They have united every local government association against them—the A.M.C., the county councils, the rural
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 210</span>
district councils and the urban district councils. To get those four bodies in unanimous agreement about something is indeed an achievement.<br><br>
What these bodies are in agreement about is not the proposal for a regional basis for water. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East (Mr. Barry Jones) about that. I think that most hon. Members on this side—and incidentally, Mrs. Butler, I draw your attention to the fact that once again we are keeping a quorum—support those regional proposals for water. What the Minister has not answered, what the Secretary of State has not answered, and what the argument is about, is democracy. The argument is about the rights of people in regional communities to have some say in the government of the important and vital service of water supplies and of sewage disposal. I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to reply to this point.<br><br>
I hope the Minister will go even further than that and say, on this important Amendment, that as water will slop into the provisions on provincial government in some way or another, obviously not in the exact words of this Amendment, he will consider it again. I am certain that my hon. Friends would then quickly take a certain course but this point must be answered. Are the regional boards to have any element of democracy, and, if so, what? If they are to be democratic, why cannot the Government deal with it in this Bill, instead of making an <i>ex cathedra</i> statement in the House when a Bill is already passing through the House on the very subject on which the Minister of State is speaking?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Derail Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene briefly and with diffidence to speak to an Amendment which relates to local government in England, but I believe that the Amendment is such that, if it were accepted and put into operation, it would involve substantial devolution of power, and this is of interest to Wales also.<br><br>
It is sometimes thought that the problem which lies at the heart of this Amendment is one that troubles only the Celtic fringe. I have always taken the view that it is in the interests of good government in Britain in general that as much power as possible be devolved upon regional authorities from central government. I am glad to know that my hon. Friends
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0123">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 211</span>
feel also that England would benefit from such devolution in the same way as the other countries of the United Kingdom. If there is to be a major devolution of power to provincial or regional bodies, it should come as one package for the whole of Britain and not merely as a sop to certain sentiments in some of the other countries of the United Kingdom. But I am disappointed that the Government seem to indicate that provincial government is separate and different from local government. The White Paper states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government agree with the Redcliffe-Maud Commission in thinking that areas of this size"—</p></blockquote>
that is, areas served by provincial authorities—
<br><blockquote><p>"would be too large … for the operation of local government services."</p></blockquote>
I suggest that that begs the issue, because we have to decide, first, what services and what powers we want to see exercised by local bodies, as distinct from central Government. Once we have so decided, we should establish local institutions, be they community councils at one end of the scale or provincial bodies at the other end, to exercise those powers.<br><br>
A provincial council, for instance, may be too large to operate refuse collection but not too large to plan communication on a regional basis. As far as I can see under our constitution all local government is a devolution of power from the centre. How much power are we to devolve, and to what bodies are we to devolve it?<br><br>
We hear the constant argument that we must ensure that local authorities are large enough to be efficient and yet small enough to give personal service and to militate against a feeling of remoteness. I agree with that, but it seems to me that in their proposals for England the Government have fallen between two stools. The proposed metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties may not be large enough to carry out certain functions, but may be too big for other purposes. We tend to fall into the trap of assuming that a large unit is necessarily more efficient than a small unit. The important question is not the size of the unit but the nature of the functions given to the unit. A provincial council may not be too large for some purposes but too large for others.<br><br>
In this debate my hon. Friends have enumerated some of the powers and functions that should be given to pro-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 212</span>
vincial councils. I admit that it is not easy to draw up a credible and comprehensive list. However, I would have thought that at the top of any list would come questions of industrial development and planning on a regional basis. The present councils are much too small to do that work effectively. The new metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties might be large enough, but they will not be able to plan on a regional basis because in many cases their boundaries will cut across the natural geographical boundaries of the regions. Until we learn to plan our industrial development by taking into account the different geographical and resource features of the regions we will not get the best out of our development area policies.<br><br>
There is also a strong case for giving provincial councils substantial power to plan communications, both road and rail. In addition, they might take some responsibility for higher education and for the arts and other cultural matters.<br><br>
Strong provincial councils would counterbalance the ever-increasing drift to the South-East and the all-too-prevalent idea that everything is done in London and nothing happens in the regions. Without strong regional councils the drift will get worse, especially with the added impetus which would be given if we were to join the Common Market.<br><br>
In Wales we have the additional difficulty of trying to marry some kind of council with the powers of the Secretary of State. I do not think that any of my hon. Friends in Wales would wish to see the establishment of a Welsh provincial council which derogated from and reduced the power and authority of the Secretary of State in the Cabinet. That is a problem which we have to resolve in Wales. It would not arise in England if provincial councils were established.<br><br>
It is because I feel that the establishment of provincial councils can make a substantial contribution to better local government that I find the Government's attitude to Crowther rather disturbing. The Minister says that Crowther has nothing to do with local government. That is an entirely mistaken view, because its recommendations could profoundly affect local government. If Crowther were to recommend provincial councils for England, such councils could have an effective and meaningful existence only if they took some powers—such as industrial planning
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0124">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 213</span>
and communications—away from the new metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties. To interpose these councils in a kind of no-man's-land between local government and central Government would reduce them to a very low status. In that case it would not much matter whether or not they were directly elected by the electorate. The danger is that the Government will try to slot them in between their new so-called reformed local government and the central Government functions.<br><br>
11.15a.m.<br><br>
This Bill is meant to reform local government, but in many cases the Government are merely changing boundaries and transferring functions between authorities. The Amendment on provincial councils holds out the prospect of a real reform and devolution of power. As such, it merits serious consideration by the Minister and by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brynmor John</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very brief in addressing the Committee on this point. It has relevance in the Welsh as well as the English context, but as I intervened during the Minister's speech, I feel it right to make some reply.<br><br>
It is very dangerous for us to adopt fashionable words. The current expression is "trendy", and two or three years ago the trendy expression was "alienation". Television programmes showed the way in which people were becoming alienated from government, and were becoming disenchanted by the whole democratic process. There was a considerable amount of anxiety. Now, two years later, without anything having been done except the setting up of the Crowther Commission, the Minister is settling back into a complacent rut where everything is all right and can be dealt with by a process of mere tinkering. It will be a blow to the democratic process and the credibility of democracy if we are seen to be responding only to immediate imperatives, rather than taking a long view of what is best for the government of the country. Basically, that is the job of the Bill.<br><br>
The Bill seeks to plan the future identity of local government over a long period. If we rush this job we shall have failed in our primary task. One thing is apparent in the Committee: whatever the difficulties of finding identity within sizes of authorities, most of my hon. Friends—certainly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 214</span>
those from England—identify themselves with regions as much as with a country. They identify themselves almost with the classic kingdoms of England, as they existed hundreds of years ago. To create regional councils would therefore provide a sense of identity which is missing in England and Wales. When we speak of Welsh devolution, let us make it quite clear that the argument for devolution is equally valid for England and for Wales.<br><br>
My second point concerns the Crowther Commission. Most of the difficulty in this debate has arisen from the incredible dance being performed by the Minister of waiting for Crowther and not waiting for Crowther. On the one hand, he argues that we must wait for Crowther; on the other hand, he cannot wait for Crowther. His argument for not waiting for Crowther comes down to two items. First, there is the argument that we must have certainty in local government. Many staffs are upset and uncertain—and there cannot be good local government as things are. In his speech on 2nd December the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have set things going, and if we have to adjust them later then we will do so."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee D,</i> 2nd December, 1971; <i>c.</i> 156.]</p></blockquote>
That will perpetuate the very uncertainty which he claims the Bill will cure. In prejudging Crowther the Minister is missing a great opportunity, and putting in train a reform which will have constantly to be tinkered with over the years, when he could wait for a comprehensive Measure to incorporate everything.<br><br>
The Minister's second reason for not waiting is that Crowther has taken the view that there is no need to wait for the report. My hon. Friends and I have received a letter from Lord Crowther, and he has certainly said that so far as boundaries within Wales are concerned, there is no need for the Government to wait. But he also says that although it is not part of the committee's function to look at boundaries, it is part of its function, as a committee, to look at the functions of local government. He says that that is an important qualification.<br><br>
I have already told the Committee that the Welsh Report on local government reform states that boundaries are dependent on the functions given to any local authority. It is a circular argument, and to say that Lord Crowther, as a private individual, has indicated to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0125">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 215</span>
Government that they need not hold this up is not sufficient argument for the Government's not discharging their own duty to decide the best form of legislation. On all counts the regional form is best. The Government should give an undertaking that if Crowther reports whilst we are still deliberating they will consider incorporating the Crowther recommendations in the Bill. If we have to adjust it later on, as the Minister suggests, we shall be constantly plagued with a whole proliferation of amending legislation, and we shall eventually have to bring everything into one Act. By rushing ahead we are postponing the inevitable.<br><br>
The Minister has quoted the Redcliffe-Maud Report as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"We do not believe, however, that the province is the right area for the operation of local government services."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend dealt with that. The essential difference between central and local government is that central Government is legislative whilst local government is administrative. In looking for provincial councils we are none of us urging legislative functions for the provinces, and they are therefore proper local government bodies. The earlier part of paragraph 439 of the Redcliffe-Maud Report says that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The terms of reference of the Commission on the Constitution . . . suggest the possibility that what we have called provinces may enjoy a greater measure of self-government in future. If there were a substantial devolution of central government functions to provincial councils or if they became directly responsible for the operation of major local government services—and especially if both of these things happened—it would be logical to envisage provincial councils as becoming largely composed of directly elected representatives."</p></blockquote>
In dealing with Wales the Government have said that on questions concerning water they are waiting for the Crowther Commission before deciding how the relevant body should be composed. My plea to the Minister is that at this stage he should not shut his mind to the possibility of creating meaningful regional government, because to do so would be to impoverish the quality of local government in the years ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have been fortunate to hear constructive speeches, but it is a pity that the speeches should have come only from one side of the Committee—except for one hon. Gentleman opposite and the Ministers.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 216</span>
I note with some concern the almost Trappist silence adopted by Welsh Members opposite. They have plenty to say outside, but not a word inside, in five sittings of a Committee dealing with major principles.<br><br>
The question of provincial councils is hotly debated in Wales and widely discussed as a matter of major public interest. It is a pity that hon. Gentlemen opposite who sit for Welsh constituencies have nothing to say on this important question. Even as I speak, the Opposition is keeping a quorum, or our deliberations would not be possible.<br><br>
The Bill is the largest measure of local government reform for 80 years. The Opposition moved to have it discussed downstairs, because so many are eager to participate, and yet the Government are unable to keep a quorum in the Committee. There has not been a quorum on the Government benches for the past three-quarters of an hour. Both sides have agreed about the necessity for a measure of devolution and regional government—or at least they did until the Minister's statement at our last Sitting. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John) for drawing attention to some of the questions that have gone unanswered.<br><br>
My hon. Friend reminded us of the Welsh Water Board which the Bill is supposed to create, and which we would welcome if it were a more democratic body than it looks like becoming. Yet we are to wait for Crowther so that we may know the constitution of the Welsh National Water Development Authority. They will not wait for Crowther in England. I am hoping that the Minister of State for Wales will break his silence and reply. If the right hon. Gentleman has learnt that silence is golden, no doubt we shall appreciate his silence when he sits down.<br><br>
I want to discuss the Welsh attitude to provincial councils. The Labour Party in Wales is firmly on record, having given evidence to the Crowther Commission, as being in favour of an elected council as part of the machinery of government in the Principality of Wales. I believe that it should be directly elected. I am no lover of indirect election for such bodies. Will the Minister of State tell us today, since he has refused to give evidence to Crowther, whether he would be prepared to undertake, as my hon. Friends have asked, if
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0126">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 217</span>
Crowther reports whilst this Committee is still meeting or while the Bill is still before the House at any stage, that the Government will make provision for alteration of the measure if Crowther recommends a regional council, which has been asked for by every political party in Wales except the Conservative Party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are we to understand that we shall lose our Welsh colleagues? Will they meet in Cardiff for long periods?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee is getting on to very dangerous ground. We are getting on to Part II of the Bill. I must ask the hon. Member to confine his remarks to the Amendment.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend misunderstood me, and that is putting it kindly. We have no intention of robbing the House of our services.<br><br>
There is a proliferation of nominated bodies controlling public services, both in England and in Wales. Far too many people have their fingers on the levers of power in vital public services but are not directly responsible to the public. The public expects a major Measure such as this to tackle this question.<br><br>
I underline what my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Denzil Davies) said. The policy of devolution should be common for all parts of the United Kingdom. We do not want to find that action is proposed in a panic measure in future when we could, with cool deliberation now, have provision made for the provincial councils which would be a halfway house between Whitehall and the municipal centres.<br><br>
Much has been said about the functions of such a provincial council. I will limit my words this morning, because we have had a thorough discussion on a major issue which was worthy of a thorough discussion. Not a word has been wasted by this side on this matter.<br><br>
The Minister is a master of the English language. I do not seek to vie with his control of the language of Chaucer, Shakespeare and Wordsworth. He has used that language to cover up his thoughts. He has used that language, not to reveal his clear intention with regard to provincial government, but, rather, to create the maximum dubiety. If we are to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 218</span>
hear the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt), who has the privilege of speaking for Wales, I hope that he at least will make clear the Government's attitude on this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Welsh Office (Mr. David Gibson-Watt)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That sounds rather like Cardiff Arms Park when the English come there next time.<br><br>
I am happy to answer the right hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. George Thomas) and his colleagues, all of whom have made thoughtful contributions to the debate. The right hon. Gentleman's memory in discussing the question of evidence to Crowther is a little at fault. He will agree that, when he was Secretary of State for Wales, he did not submit evidence to the Crowther Commission. He left it to the regional council of labour, which is somewhat different. It is only since the right hon. Gentleman has been in opposition that he appears to have been speaking in the way that he has done this morning.<br><br>
I come now to the serious points raised by the hon. Member for Flint, East (Mr. Barry Jones). He spoke of the particular problems of North Wales and the future of the new authority at Clwyd. The hon. Gentleman asked whether this authority would be strong enough to deal with some of the bigger creations across the English border. I have never found Flintshire, part of which the hon. Gentleman represents, to be backward in any way as a local authority. The new and strengthened authority of Clwyd will not be backward either.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred also to the question of the new Welsh National Water Development Authority. I shall not go deeply into this matter this morning because, as the Committee knows, Clause 175 deals with water and sewage matters. The idea of a Welsh Water Development Authority has had a measure of support since it was announced. The pressing problems of the Dee crossing and its future are certainly not in the mind of only the hon. Member for Flint, East. They are in the Government's mind as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do I take it that in his summing-up the Minister of State is replying exclusively to the Welsh contribution? Has he anything to say about the contributions made by the English Members, especially on the major question of principle about the future reorganisation

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 219</span>
of water in England and Wales? We are entitled to a reply on this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was requested by the right hon. Member for Cardiff, West, I am replying specifically to the Welsh matters which have been raised by four right hon. and hon. Gentlemen representing Welsh constituencies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the Minister's intention is, but that is inadequate. It is not sufficient to say; "I will wind up the debate", as the hon. Gentleman did on Second Reading, and then spend the time exclusively on Welsh matters. The Bill refers to England and Wales, and it should be dealt with as such. I am absolutely in favour of an intervention to deal with the Welsh problems. However, on general principles, I think that we are entitled to an answer from some member of the Government. After all, the Government are indivisible and they cannot divide themselves up, as the hon. Gentleman appears to be doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but I am sure that he would not wish to suggest that I was being discourteous to the hon. Members from Welsh constituencies who, as I have said, have made considered speeches this morning. If I confine myself to answering the Welsh points, I am sure the right hon. Member for Cardiff, West will be on my side.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Denzil Davies) also dealt—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Butler. We are, I presume, still discussing the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) on provincial councils. I raised many serious questions for the Minister's attention. I hope that these will not be excluded. If the hon. Gentleman's speech is an answer to the Welsh contributions, it does not exclude the need for the Minister for Local Government and Development to reply to the general observations on the Amendment, which refers to England and Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been primarily about England. Wales has been mentioned by way of illustration. So far, nothing has been out of order.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mrs. Butler. The hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Denzil Davies) made his views very clear on the question of provincial government. He spoke about remoteness and discussed the whole question of the division of powers in any possible future provincial council. He made it very clear that he would not wish in any way to derogate from the powers that exist at the present time in the hands of the Secretary of State for Wales. The hon. Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John) followed this argument when he said that he considered that any future provincial government would be administrative rather than executive. These are all views which—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was seeking to draw the distinction between legislative and administrative powers. That is the important difference between central and local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Gentleman says; it is exactly what he did say. I think that these matters of provincial government can only be finally decided when we have the Crowther Commission Report, when we know what the Commission thinks on this matter, which is of great importance in Wales.<br><br>
I do not wish to go further into this question of water. I only say that when we are dealing with the future of provincial councils in Wales, we have very strong views, perhaps cross-party views. It is clear that in the past this has been so. Therefore, it would not be right to pursue this matter in answering an Amendment in this debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What proposals does the hon. Gentleman have if Crowther reports before this Bill seeks Royal Assent? Surely the Government will take this major opportunity to listen to Crowther.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibson-Watt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think anyone would deny that the Government will listen to Crowther. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will admit that he would be unrealistic if he asked me now to say what the Government would, in fact, do on Crowther in answer to this Amendment.<br><br>
I hope that what I have said has gone some way, if not to meet every point raised by all members of the Committee, at least to help some of the hon. Gentlemen representing Welsh constituencies.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0128">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 221</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was hesitating for a moment in the expectation and hope that the Minister for Local Government and Development would take the opportunity to reply to my hon. Friends the Members for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) and for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell), because they raised important matters. I think we have been fully justified in the time we have rightly taken to explore this matter, not only for our own sake and the sake of our constituencies, but because of the genuine and widespread concern that undoubtedly exists in the country—and I would emphasise this—from those who will have the responsibility of carrying out many of the provisions of this Bill. They are deeply disturbed about the whole situation, and are demanding clarification about the situation of the provinces.<br><br>
My hon. Friend raised the question of what is to happen if we have the Crowther Commission Report before this Bill completes its journey through the Commons and indeed, through the Lords. Will the Government give some assurance now that they will seek to include suitable provisions in this Bill, even at a later stage, in order to meet any requirements that Crowther may recommend with regard to the regional position? That is one point on which we have not had an answer.<br><br>
I asked the Minister—and so far I have not had a reply—whether he would at least take the occasion of the Report stage, if not before, to make a further statement about the detailed form of the regional structure that the Ministry are apparently intending to establish. I am well aware that he has already given us some outline on this situation, which frankly worries us, even though he has clearly said that this is meant to be provisional.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I am sure we are right to call upon the Minister to let us know now whether he could give at least some further information on this regional structure, because our whole attitude to the Bill and to its detailed provisions depends upon this matter. How does it fit together? Unless we have that assurance, we are in very great difficulties in this Committee.<br><br>
I ask the Minister now if he would intervene, even briefly, merely to offer me that assurance, that he will be pre-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 222</span>
pared to intervene on Report to give further information on the structure the Government intend at regional level. I will sit down now if the Minister will intervene. [<i>Laughter.</i>] Hon. Members opposite laugh. They have made no contribution, purposely, to the serious debate—they can laugh as much as they like—but every officer in the country responsible for this work and for carrying out this work is concerned with these points that we are raising.<br><br>
It seems extraordinary that hon. Members opposite are incapable of any speech on this subject. I think it very unfortunate. Nevertheless, my colleagues and I are anxious to pursue other matters on this Clause, and later on the Schedule, and, with that in mind, I still hope that we shall be able to return to the Government structure on Report. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are not the matters of great moment that we have been discussing in previous Amendments. Nevertheless, I think that they are of considerable importance so far as civic pride is concerned, in the areas in England affected by this Bill.<br><br>
The effect of my Amendment is that the second-tier authorities—if I may still use that name—which are at present called "districts" under the Bill, shall be renamed "boroughs" under the Bill. Correspondingly, the chairman of the district council should be known as a mayor and his deputy as a deputy mayor. I want to draw the distinction at the outset, because there are other Amendments on the Order Paper that would preserve existing boroughs with the titles of mayor, deputy mayor and so on, and the title of borough. While I support some of the Amendments put down by my hon. Friends so far as parish and community councils are concerned, I would not support, in a new structure of local government, the retention of the names of borough, mayor and so on for existing boroughs. What I am proposing is something quite different. It is that the new districts be called not districts but boroughs.<br><br>
The term "borough" is traditionally in English local government a recognised name, just as "county" is a recognised name, whereas "district" is something not particularly associated with local government in the same way. "borough" conjures up a corporate area. The more that we can do to strengthen local government at the district level the better, and therefore, the title "borough" would give people in that district a sense of belonging to a corporate entity which the word "district" fails to give.<br><br>
Under the Bill local government districts
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 224</span>
will be much larger than the existing areas of local government. At the present time there are county boroughs, boroughs and cities. Some are presently described as urban districts and rural districts, but the new district authorities will, in the main, be very much bigger authorities in area, population, rateable value and importance, to the present size of boroughs and local authorities. Because of the size, and because of the importance that I attach to them, I think that the name "borough" would be a proper name to distinguish them from the county instead of the mere name "district".<br><br>
Under Clause 3 of the Bill the Government propose in certain instances to allow a district to call itself a borough but, for some strange reason, in order to do so, the district concerned must, after it is set up by a two-thirds majority, petition the Queen for the charter to receive separate borough status.<br><br>
As a result of that, there will be different authorities with exactly the same powers, some authorities being called "boroughs" and some "districts", which is not at all a good thing for local government. There will be needless expense, with these districts passing resolutions, petitioning the Queen, waiting for the Secretary of State, which to my mind is quite needless. There is the third difficulty in that, if we create them "boroughs" <i>ab initio</i> under the terms of the Bill, from the start they have the sense of corporate entity instead of their having to change the title after a year or two of the Bill being in operation—if their petition is successful.<br><br>
We have, also, the difficulty that some districts which petition to be called boroughs will be rejected. On what grounds could there be a rejection of a petition when other similar areas will be called boroughs? This is a muddle in the Bill. The Government have made a very poor compromise. They have had pressures put upon them to retain the name "borough", and by inserting Clause 3 they have allowed great cities, towns and county boroughs to retain their name and title.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend might take into account those boroughs who would be able to apply under the Bill but who would give up their ancient charter of borough status, a status which has intrinsic value to the corporations. They will be given a uniform charter which has very
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0130">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 225</span>
little meaning whatsoever in the sense that the boroughs understand it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, because under Part I, in another Clause, all existing charters are abolished.<br><br>
We have very distinguished areas of local government and towns in this country. There is York, whose title and entitlement to the name of "borough" goes back before the granting of their first charter. There is my own area of the ancient and loyal Borough of Wigan, which dates from the 14th century. I think of the brave Borough of Plymouth which is cruelly treated under this Bill and which loses the style, title and dignity of being called other than a district of Plymouth. These are the sorts of things that will arise under this Bill by the change of name.<br><br>
When the Conservative Government introduced the London Government Bill in 1963 they created the title "borough". The "boroughs" were bigger areas than they had been previously, but they were called boroughs from the start. What is good enough for London is good enough for the provinces and, therefore, the districts in the provinces ought to have the style and title of borough.<br><br>
I take this opportunity of saying on behalf of all hon. Members on this side of the Committee that we appreciate the gesture of the Secretary of State for the Environment in sending notes on the Bill. It is helpful to Opposition members to know, at least in outline, what the Government are thinking, and it will eventually save the time of the Committee.<br><br>
But the answer to the question of boroughs is inadequate. It says that there would be a distinction with London if they were called boroughs where there are aldermen. Under Clause 3 of the Bill we shall, of course, be creating boroughs which will not have aldermen, so where is the distinction between London and the provinces? There is no reason why the style, title and ancient usage of the word "borough" should not apply to the new districts to give a sense of corporate spirit, to give a sense of civic pride and a sense of belonging which will be desperately needed to give some form or title by which people will become attached to them. In this modern world we need this sense of civic pride and of belonging to an area, and the title "borough" would encourage that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 226</span>
To come to my proposal that the chairman of the authority be called not the chairman of the district, non-metropolitan district and so on, but the "mayor". The mayor is something very different from a chairman. It may seem to the Government and the Ministry that the titles are interchangeable, and that in fact, the mayor's function is merely to preside over his council at council sittings. That is the least of the duties of mayor—and I have been a mayor. A mayor is the civic embodiment of the corporate spirit of his borough during his year of office. He is much more than the chairman of a district council. The title "chairman" can apply to anyone, from the chairman of a domino league to the chairman of a huge board. The title of "mayor" is something quite different, quite significant, and is known in the local government context.<br><br>
When schoolchildren have a visit from the mayor it means something to them. It is important. It is not merely that an individual clad in mediaeval robes with a chain around his neck is visiting their school, but that a civic interest is being displayed on behalf of the inhabitants in that school. It is greatly appreciated and gives the children a sense of belonging to the area. That spirit would not be there if the person were called "Mr. Chairman" or the "chairman of the district". The deputy mayor stands in for the mayor, not only deputising as the chairman heading the council but deputising for the mayor in all the mayoral functions and duties that the mayor cannot attend.<br><br>
The title "mayor" and the name "borough" are part of an ancient British institution which people do not wish to lose. I am talking of the public at large, not just those in local government. This is something which they do not wish to lose. I am certain that many Members on the Government side support me in this, and certainly if they do not, many of their constituents support me. This is a matter on which the Minister can show flexibility. It is not a breaking point of the Bill. It is not something on which the Government would suffer a severe defeat. It is something which would meet a public demand and on which the Minister could be flexible.<br><br>
My Amendments possibly do not meet all the requirements of the Bill, but I ask the Minister to accept in principle the spirit of my Amendment, that the title
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0131">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 227</span>
"district" be changed to the title "borough" and that the "chairman" be known as the "mayor". Both are ancient words. Both have local government significance and both engender civic pride within an area; and if both titles are accepted no harm will be done at all to the Bill or the proposed structure of local government.<br><br>
I hope, therefore, that a Government Amendment, covering the points which I have raised, will be tabled at a later stage, to provide for the retention of institutions and names well known, loved and respected, so that they may serve local government in the centuries ahead as they have done in the past.</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evelyn King</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Amendment No. 232, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, West (Mr. Wingfield Digby) does not appear to be on the list of Amendments called. With which group of Amendments will Amendment No. 232 be discussed, assuming that it is to be discussed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That Amendment has been superseded by Amendment No. 233, in page 2, line 24, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"but in the case of boroughs in non-metropolitan counties (except those in rural districts) and urban districts which are not approximately co-extensive with the proposed new districts they shall immediately become parish councils and their existing property shall remain vested in them",</p></blockquote>
which will be called in the next large group of Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin Maddan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to intervene for the first time—[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] There may be some "Hear, hears" when I sit down—not for what I have to say, but for the brevity of my remarks.<br><br>
I have some sympathy with the point of view expressed by the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Gordon Oakes) concerning mayors, provided that he confined it to urban areas where there is in existence the kind of civic tradition which stems from a borough status having been the tradition in the past. I do not think that that applies in the case of many areas, and particularly to rural areas where I think, given the difference in the community, of different parishes and villages, that it would be entirely inappropriate.<br><br>
Will my hon. Friend take the opportunity to assure councils of new districts, which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 228</span>
are either to take exactly the same form as existing boroughs, county boroughs or otherwise, or are hardly to be changed at all, that the procedures which they will need to adopt to prepare and present their petitions will be simple, because they will be carried out at a time when the local authorities will be engaged in other, massive matters of reorganisation? The addition of this formality, which may nevertheless be complicated, may be avoided in very clear cases. I know that there will be arguments to the contrary. However, I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would speak on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan) I shall make a brief maiden speech, for which I hope that I shall be thanked by the rest of the Committee.<br><br>
I, too, have some sympathy with the general content of the remarks of the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes). However, the rural districts, as at present constituted, are opposed to the suggestion contained within the Amendment and wish the new districts to continue to be called "districts".<br><br>
The reason for that is that there is a fundamental difference between different types of districts—or at least, that will be so once the Bill becomes an Act of Parliament. I cite as an example the case of my constituency. Something approaching agreement has been reached within the county as to the shape of the new district to be set up under the Bill. In the northern part of the constituency a district will be formed, in all likelihood, together with what is now the Borough of Swindon, The total area of that district will be relatively small, and will include a large urban population.<br><br>
In the terms of the Bill as drafted, I believe that that new district will apply for a charter and will probably wish to have a mayor. However, the remainder of my constituency—approximately 200,000 acres—includes two ancient boroughs. I cannot believe that it would be sensible to suggest that that area should be called a "borough" with one mayor. I hope, therefore, that my right hon. Friend, later in the Bill, will accept Amendments aimed at allowing existing boroughs to be called parish or town councils, and that they should be allowed to continue to call their chairmen "mayors". However, I believe that it would create confusion if chairmen
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0132">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 229</span>
of districts were to be called mayors and if districts of that size were also to be called boroughs. Thus, I believe that the Bill as drafted is correct in this respect, and I hope that my hon. Friend will not accept the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak briefly at this stage, because I hope to speak at considerable length to a later series of Amendments.<br><br>
I am sure that many of us will be in agreement with much of what was said by the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes). He moved the Amendment with great eloquence.<br><br>
However, I should like to support my hon. Friends the Members for Hove (Mr. Maddan) and for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) on the subject of rural districts. There are two districts in my constituency, one of which is the Cannock Urban District—the town of Cannock with a population of over 50,000 which will, I hope, form the centre of a new district. I hope that that will be a borough, which would add to its stature, to the dignity of its officers, and to its prestige and position as an important part of the West Midlands. Many of the consequences flowing from borough status would do enormous good to Cannock.<br><br>
There is also within my constituency the Cannock Rural District, which will, I hope, form the larger part of a new, predominantly rural, district. There will be no centre there for borough status, and I do not believe that the people would wish it to be called a borough. I think that it would, to some extent, devalue the currency, without giving a sufficient illustration of what the district represented. I hope that the hon. Member for Widnes will concede that in respect of rural areas.<br><br>
However, I support the hon. Gentleman's remarks in respect of urban areas, although I hope that no decision will be taken which will prejudice the position of the many smaller ancient boroughs such as those to which my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes has just referred. However, I hope to take up that point at a later stage in our proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall intervene only briefly, as my right hon. and hon. Friends and I hope that the Minister will make a statement of the Government's intention
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
concerning boroughs and, indeed, charters in respect of county boroughs which, I understand, it is proposed may be reapplied for.<br><br>
We believe—I am sure that the Minister will agree—that it would be a great loss if the traditions of existing boroughs, especially some of the ancient royal boroughs, were to go by default because of the new units of local government reorganisation proposed in the Bill.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) made an outstanding case in favour of the Amendment, particularly in respect of the title which the chief citizen of an area should have. All of us who have been connected with local government, for however brief a period, know that there are innumerable occasions, particularly social occasions, which may be elevated by having someone of distinction present who is recognised as being the first citizen and whose title and style of address embodies all the civic spirit which communities wish to display. Nothing can be lost by referring to most of these urban areas as boroughs, because the terminology of "borough" is one of the most time-honoured definitions of local government organisation that is enshrined in our law.<br><br>
It may be that my hon. Friend's Amendment is not quite correct. However, he has done a great service by moving it so that we can discuss the question. We should be able to make speedy progress on the Amendment if the Minister could give us some assurance that he and his colleagues would look at this again in order to seek to preserve the traditions which we seek to preserve. Perhaps they could table some Amendments at a later stage in our proceedings.<br><br>
We want to retain the title "borough" and certainly want to retain the title "mayor" for the leading citizen in these local authority areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment, especially as regards boroughs in the metropolitan districts. It is impossible to suggest that within the metropolitan counties there will be a single district to which the arguments put forward by hon. Members opposite apply. These are clearly urban areas under any possible interpretation of the word. From the word "go", and without any nonsense about reapplying for charters, those districts should be metropolitan boroughs.<br><br>
I want to follow up the point about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0133">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 231</span>
existing charters. It would be unfortunate if there were to be a lapse in the charters and new charters had to be made out. In such a case the only people who would profit from the exercise would presumably be the College of Heralds, which would make large sums making new coats of arms for the new boroughs. If we were able to ensure that the existing charters could continue to be used, there would not be this gross inflation in the income of the College of Heralds. I hope, therefore, that it will be possible as regards the metropolitan districts, if not for all the districts, for the principle in the Amendment to be adopted.<br><br>
My second point is the question of mayors. At a function recently in Lancashire I was told about the embarrassment of the Chairman of the Lancashire County Council: when he attends various civic occasions, all the other mayors and chairmen of urban districts wear chains, but he does not have one to wear round his neck. I hope that the Amendment will be adopted with regard to the name "mayor" and that the chains which have gained considerable historic links can be used for the new boroughs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Goronwy Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may be able to enlighten me now or later on this point. It anticipates the Welsh Schedule. It would be helpful to many of us if the Minister could say something on this question. I think that the hon. Member for Conway (Mr. Wyn Roberts) wishes this to be put.<br><br>
What is the position having regard to new charters where a schedule, either English or Welsh, constitutes a new district made up of two existing municipal boroughs plus an existing rural district? I have in mind the proposal to amalgamate the very ancient and Royal Borough of Caernarvon with the almost equally ancient, and certainly very honourable, Borough of Bangor with the hinterland which is now a rural district. I imagine that the Royal Borough will wish to proceed to charter under the new dispensation, but what is the position with regard to the other municipal borough, which enjoys and has enjoyed for more than 700 years the privileges and status of a chartered borough?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evelyn King</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A little to my surprise this debate has turned to a. considerable extent on the question of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
mayor. That question, as I understand it, will be revised in future Amendments. I hope that my Learned Friend the Minister will not commit himself on this subject, until he has heard the immensely powerful arguments which will later be advanced on those Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The title of mayor is rightly discussed under this group of Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Butler. Is this the right way to put it? One of the Amendments, to which my hon. Friend referred, stands in my name and his and specifically refers to the title of mayor and comes under the next grouping headed by Amendment No. 15. I presume that you will not rule us out of order if we develop our case then at some length.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Butler. At the outset of my speech, knowing that hon. Gentlemen opposite had this other Amendment down, I tried to make it clear to the Committee that these are quite separate and distinct Amendments.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it would be for the convenience of the Committee, I shall confine my remarks to the case put by the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) that districts as a whole should be called "boroughs". We are not dealing with separate boroughs which may form part of districts eventually; that will come in a later Amendment.<br><br>
It is only as a "passing comment in reply to the right hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Goronwy Roberts) that I say that we are not dealing on this Amendment with the sort of small boroughs, comprised within a district, about which he was speaking. In that case they will all surrender their existing charters, and it will then be a matter for the new district to consider what the new district shall be called and whether the new district will petition for the charter. If the right hon. Gentleman will be patient, we shall be discussing this question in much greater detail on a later Amendment.<br><br>
I thank the hon. Member for Widnes for putting this argument at this stage. We are not at issue in any way that it is desirable for the new district to be a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0134">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 233</span>
borough if it so wishes. I emphasise "if it so wishes". The Bill provides for the divisions of the counties to be called districts and for them to have chairmen of their councils. The Amendment provides for the divisions of the counties to be boroughs with mayors. The Bill gives the districts the freedom of choice if they wish to be boroughs, or if a district wishes to be a borough. It can then petition under the provisions of Clause 3 for a Royal Charter.<br><br>
The Amendment gives no such freedom. This is where I am at issue with the hon. Member for Widnes. The Amendment would make the district automatically a borough with a mayor. We consulted all the local authority associations on this point, and they all preferred the choice being left to the district as to whether it should be a borough or a district, whether it should have a mayor or a chairman.<br><br>
I have here a letter from the Rural District Councils Association which was written to my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) and to the hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Mr. Armstrong). One paragraph of that letter says:
<br><blockquote><p>"We believe it is important that all concerned should realise that the new districts are indeed new ones: that the old authorities are going out of existence and a fresh start is being made. Our fear is that the automatic grant of borough status would lead to reorganisation at district level being viewed simply as the existing boroughs extending their boundaries."</p></blockquote>
It must be realised that we are reorganising local government. These new districts will in many cases comprise perhaps two or more boroughs. In my constituency it comprises three boroughs and an urban district. That new district has to decide whether it will apply for a charter and, if so, what it is to be called—a choice amongst three boroughs and an urban district. It will not be an easy choice.<br><br>
We must put it clearly to the new districts that they are new districts, that they have new councils, that they must decide what their communities are to be called, and that they must decide whether they require the provisions of Royal Charters as boroughs. In the application for the petition, I do not think that there will be any difficulty or delay. Clause 3 provides that immediately the "shadow" council is elected it can get to work and apply for a charter.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 234</span>
The petition and its contents are foreshadowed in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>c</i>) of Clause 3(1), which states in particular that Her Majesty may grant a Royal Charter preserving the provisions, so far as they are appropriate, of a previous charter of the whole district, or of the two or more charters of boroughs within that district. Thus, even though every borough holding a Royal Charter will, on the Royal Assent to the Bill, surrender its existing charter, the new charter—if a petition is made for one—will endeavour to preserve all the ancient dignities which the previous borough would wish to preserve, and try to give a continuous borough status.<br><br>
If the shadow council elected before April 1974 decides that the new district should be a borough and should have a Royal Charter, it may apply at once. The only provision in the Bill relating to timing states that the Royal Charter shall not come into operation before 1st April, 1974. However, it can come into operation on that date, so that the new district may start off both with the title of borough and the title of mayor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the Minister for his helpful and informative reply. However, I should like to know why every existing borough must surrender its charter and re-apply. That is a matter for concern to many authorities. A charter may embody hundreds of years of local history and tradition. Why is it necessary to surrender a charter in order to start anew in 1972 or 1973? Can it not be carried through?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a question of the machinery of the matter. Where, for example, there are two boroughs within the new district, a new charter for that new district is obviously needed. We cannot merely take one or other of those old charters.<br><br>
I should perhaps withdraw the word "surrender", and use the word "lapse", since the charters themselves will remain in existence. They will be preserved and, as far as possible, their provisions will be introduced into the new charter. I should like to think of those charters merely lapsing in their effect on the boroughs to which they apply at present, and being overtaken by a fresh charter granted by Her Majesty to the new district.<br><br>
I believe that I have met the request
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0135">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 235</span>
of the hon. Member for Widnes to the extent of saying that the shadow councils will be able to get their petition in time to be called a borough and to have a mayor at the very outset.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Widnes referred to Plymouth. It is a curious formality that a town does not obtain the title "Royal" or "City" by charter, but receives it by letters patent. That is merely another form of application, and presents no difficulty. Of course, we hope that the formalities for making these applications for petitions will be as brief as possible. However, I am sure that it is right for us to retain the traditions which bring these sort of dignities into operation. It should not be merely stated in statute that these authorities shall become boroughs. Under those circumstances there would be no Royal Charter for the new district to look back on. We are preserving in a lapsed form the existing charters, embodying what is necessary from them in new charters to the new districts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat relieved by the Minister's reply, in the first place with regard to time. Under the terms of Clause 3 it appeared that there would be a considerable element of discretion on the part of the Privy Council, as to whom they would or would not grant borough status. From what the Minister said it now appears that, almost invariably, and virtually automatically, if a district seeks borough status that status will be granted to it.<br><br>
I appreciate the points made by some hon. Members opposite with respect to rural areas—a point that caused me considerable thought. In reply, I would say that there were in existence until recently—in fact, a few of them survived in name before the Bill—rural boroughs such as Ludlow, in respect of which the title of "borough" was acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall want to discuss the question of Ludlow later. However, Ludlow is a town and cannot be equated with a rural district.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that Ludlow is a town, but in the countryside there is some historical precedent for the word "borough" being used, even in an area that we may regard as a very lovely rural one at the present time.<br><br>
Another point arises from my Amendment. The Secretary of State has said that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 236</span>
he has sought, in the Bill, to bring town and country together. As a townee, I may wish to bring them together in a different way from the way favoured by hon. Members representing predominantly rural constituencies. However, I do not believe that countryside people, as distinct from countryside councillors—from rural district councils—would feel aggrieved at belonging to a borough, even though that borough was very much a rural farming area. Nevertheless, I concede that there are points with respect to rural areas which my Amendment does not sufficiently cover.<br><br>
With regard to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) I suggest to the Minister that the case for borough status for metropolitan districts is overwhelming. As he clearly pointed out, all the arguments of town and country disappear when we are dealing with a metropolitan area. There at least the districts could, <i>ab initio,</i> be called boroughs.<br><br>
The Minister did not deal at any length with the title of "mayor". I accept that later Amendments will deal more fully with that point, so I shall not dwell on it at this stage. Incidentally, my hon. Friend talked about Lancashire County Council chairmen. Those members of the Committee who have been mayors will know the basic rule when one attends a civic function—that one judges the size of the authority in inverse proportion to the size of the chain. Thus, if a man is not wearing a chain at all he must be extremely important.<br><br>
I believe that the views of the Committee on this point have been made known. I am satisfied that the process of obtaining a charter will not be a protracted affair, which might meet with failure. One of the reasons for my not confining my Amendments to metropolitan boroughs was that some areas—such as that of my right hon. Friend the Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Goronwy Roberts)—will constitute a number of boroughs or urban districts combined together. My own area is a case in point.<br><br>
In my constituency the borough of Widnes will be linked with the county of Cheshire—which, at the moment, is an alien county to us, north of the river—and with Runcorn Urban District and Runcorn New Town, which will form a new unit. That new unit will need to have a name. We shall not want Widnes-cum-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0136">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 237</span>
Runcorn, or Runcorn-cum-Widnes, or anything of that kind. My own suggestion would be Halton. The Minister of State will appreciate that Halton Castle is in Runcorn, and that there were originally barons of Halton and Widnes. One of the reasons why I am so attached to the name of Halton is that Halton Castle stands as a splendid citadel in the county of Cheshire but belongs to the Duchy of Lancaster, so at least we would take something with us, if it were only the name of the borough.<br><br>
I am somewhat satisfied by the Minister's assurances and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 8, in page 1, line 19, leave out "the said column 2" and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"column 2 of the said Part I".—[<i>Mr. Graham Page.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 9, in page 1, line 22, after "State", insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"after consultation with the councils of the administrative areas existing immediately before the passing of this Act".</p></blockquote>
Again, this is something of a probing Amendment. In line 22, the Minister would seem to have overall power on the naming of the authority. In moving the Amendment, I wish to find out from the Minister just what consultation will take place from the Minister when deciding again on the all-important matter of a name. The Amendment suggests that in naming the authority he should consult the local authorities, or the councils of the administrative areas which exist before the Bill comes into force. Those are the people with whom he should consult.<br><br>
Regarding the last Amendment, I somewhat facetiously dealt with the question of a name for a new authority in my own area. These are the considerations that the Minister should bear in mind. He should consult with people in the area and not merely manufacture a name in his fortress in Whitehall which might be totally unacceptable to the people of the area. Any Minister can make a mistake. I remember that Lord Greenwood at one time suggested for the Chorley-Leyland new town the name "Redrose", which would have been an abomination. Ministers do make
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 238</span>
mistakes of that nature. But what I am seeking is to ensure that the Minister concerned consults with people in the area so that there will be some element of local choice in this all-important matter of the name.<br><br>
I am sure that he will, but my Amendment seeks to force him to have consultations with the people in the area instead of manufacturing in the fortresses of Whitehall a name which might be totally unacceptable to the people concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no issue between myself and the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) on this point. He wishes the Secretary of State to consult with local authorities concerned before making an order as to the name of a new district. I ask him to accept the assurance that the Secretary of State will consult with those concerned without any necessity for putting it in the Statute.<br><br>
We are fully in agreement with the purpose of the Amendment. There must be local consultations before names are decided upon, and heaven forbid that we should try to decide the names in Whitehall. I assure him that we would never try to do so, but we prefer that it should not be specifically stated in the Bill. Without going into the intricacies of the law, I am sure that he will appreciate it if I mention the case in 1948 of Rollo <i>v.</i> the Minister of Town and Country Planning which illustrates the difficulties that can be created out of a duty to consult. Consultations will start long before the Bill becomes law, and I hope that consultations are already going on between the present districts concerned in an amalgamation with a new district, and that names will be emerging by agreement.<br><br>
Having consulted before the Bill becomes law, we do not want them prejudiced by a statutory requirement that the Secretary of State should then consult once again and perhaps open up a subject which has been amicably settled between the councils concerned.<br><br>
I object to including this provision in the Bill because I think it unnecessary. I hope that the hon. Member will accept my assurance that the Secretary of State will consult. As proof of our intention, I refer him to Circular 58/71 which deals with the naming of metropolitan and non-metropolitan districts and which says that consultation on names of the individual districts will be initiated later; and,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0137">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 239</span>
secondly, that local consideration of names for new districts is specifically mentioned later in the Bill. Under Clause 243 where we set up joint committees of local authorities, subsection (2) specifically mentions names as being a subject for recommendation by the joint committees. There is that provision in the Bill and, also, the intentions expressed in the circular, and I ask the hon. Member for Widnes to accept my assurance that there will be consultations. Indirectly, we are forced into these consultations without making it a statutory duty in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister says that consultations are taking place at the present time, does he mean that direct consultations are taking place between the Ministry and the local authorities, or is this a matter that is being left to the Local Government Boundary Commission? Are the consultations direct between the Secretary of State and the authorities, or is the Commission advising him?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is only direct in that we are acting as a post office for passing on to the Boundary Commission. Any representations on districts at the moment come to us merely as a post office and are passed on to the Boundary Commission. In due course we shall have recommendations from the Boundary Commission on the districts, and I assume from that, on the name of the district which is recommended by the Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister assure us that although this Amendment refers only to districts inside metropolitan counties, these consultations will definitely include consultations with the local authorities in areas outside metropolitan counties—in other words, districts in non-metropolitan counties, and that these names will be the subject of consultation? I make this point because the areas of the districts within metropolitan counties are specified in the Bill and, therefore, consultations can begin. Consultations about the names of districts outside the metropolitan areas cannot begin yet and I want the Minister's assurance that they will take place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must admit that I had not noticed that this only referred to districts within metropolitan counties, but all my remarks apply to metropolitan districts and districts in the non-metropolitan counties.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 240</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's assurance that consultations will take place between the Secretary of State and the local areas concerned for reasons with which we both agree. I was disappointed when he said that the Department was acting as post office for the Local Boundary Commission, but for different reasons. As a member of the Committee, I am sorely aggrieved, as are others of my hon. Friends, about the whole working of the Local Government Boundary Commission, which is apposite to the Amendment, because that will apparently be the body to consider naming names. That organisation is a creation which we in the House have yet to create. The Minister has set it up, and he has set it up before Royal Assent has been given to the Bill. I understand that it is already in being, that it is already consulting with local authorities, that it expects its report to be out in March, and that we, as a Committee of the House, have under consideration many matters that that Commission is considering too.<br><br>
Apparently one of those matters is the naming of boroughs. I object to a creation which has no statutory authority—the Minister and I have already been at issue on this—being brought into being before the Bill receives the Royal Assent. It is unprecedented for a Minister to set up a body of this importance before the Royal Assent has been given to the Bill empowering him to do it. That Boundary Commission is presumably receiving money. Presumably it is staffed. It has offices, postal facilities and so on. I do not know what authority there is for that expenditure until the Bill is passed.<br><br>
The Minister of State says that the Commission will be considering the question of names. I would prefer the Minister, who is a constitutional person established by the House, to decide, and not an unconstitutional body that as yet has no power, and which will have no power unless the Committee and the House authorise the setting up of Boundary Commissions later in the Bill. The Commission has pre-empted the Committee, jumped into the matter, and started to work with local authorities on the naming of names and other matters, before it has any statutory authority from the House so to do.<br><br>
Nevertheless, since the Minister has assured the Committee that in all cases the Secretary of State will consult with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0138">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 241</span>
existing areas before deciding to name any authority, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 13, in page 2, line 4, leave out "that order or those orders" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"one or more orders so made".</p></blockquote>
This deals with Clause 1(4) substituting
<br><blockquote><p>"one or more orders so made"</p></blockquote>
for
<br><blockquote><p>"that order or those orders"</p></blockquote>
at the end of the subsection.<br><br>
The words may look like drafting, but I cannot quite pass them off as a drafting Amendment. I would ask the Committee to refer to the Schedule mentioned in that subsection, Schedule 3, where under paragraph 1(1) the Secretary of State is empowered to bring the recommendations which he receives from the Boundary Commission into operation by an Order.<br><br>
Under subsection (2) of that paragraph:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may, if he thinks fit, by order give effect to any proposals under this paragraph"—</p></blockquote>
that is, proposals which come from the Boundary Commission,
<br><blockquote><p>"either as submitted to him or with modifications, but an order shall not be made under this paragraph defining the areas of non-metropolitan districts unless a draft of the order has been approved by resolution of each House of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
This refers to recommendations as to districts which the Secretary of State, having received that recommendation of the Boundary Commission, sees fit to put in an Order, and to put it before the House. Where it is fixing districts, that Order must come before the House.<br><br>
As subsection (4) is worded, such Orders could include the names of the districts, and the names of the districts would have to be included in any Order relating to the areas of those districts. I anticipate that if that is necessary, the Orders defining the districts may be unnecessarily delayed. It is the areas of the districts which we wish to bring before the House for confirmation. We would, therefore, like to give the Secretary of State power to make separate Orders, one for the area of the districts, and the other, if necessary, for the names.<br><br>
It may be that it will all work out, and that we shall have names for every
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
district by the time that the Secretary of State needs to put the Order before the House, but I should be very optimistic if I thought that was so. One of the things the districts are likely to dispute about for a long time is the names and we should like the power to make those by separate Order.<br><br>
The Amendment will give that power. There is nothing sinister or ulterior about it. We want to do this by separate Order if we can.</span></p>

and new Clause No. 1—<i>Communities.</i></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Neighbourhood community centres are something to which my hon. Friends and I attach a great deal of importance. We hope that the Minister and his colleagues will go further than the Bill and the White Paper, and that we shall carry them with us in the need, in this day and age, for the establishment of community councils. We all have our own ideas about what community councils should be called. I should like to see them called neighbourhood community councils, because the terminology "neighbourhood" expressly defines what we have in mind. The Minister mentioned Wales. The provision in the Bill in respect of Wales seems to be more progressive than that in respect of England.<br><br>
In discussing neighbourhood community councils we are coming right to the heart of the involvement of ordinary people in daily government as it touches on their lives. That is why my hon. Friends and I find the proposition so attractive, and why so many people have given it much thought. Any of us who have day-to-day contact with our constituents meet, time and time again, the view that politics do not matter, because they cannot see the point at which politics, either local or national, have a direct effect on their lives.<br><br>
Where great issues are involved, such as rents, school meals, milk, and so forth—where they can see a direct connection—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 246</span>
the people are able to respond through protests and through the democratic process. But, in so far as so many decisions are taken which affect the environment in which they live and they have their being, their relationships with other members of the local community, their relatives and their friends, they cannot see that decisions taken in the town hall or the county hall take any account of their individual wishes.<br><br>
The central question which we have to discuss is how to involve people who want to be involved in the day-to-day decisions which will affect their lives and the conditions in which they live. Interestingly, the practice in this respect varies considerably. In the county authorities there is more likely to be an attempt to take public opinion into account than is the case in urban districts and, especially, the larger towns. Officialdom and local bureaucracy are so involved in so much detailed work that with a complete absence of machinery it would be almost impossible to consult people if an official wanted to do so.<br><br>
I shall consider a number of problems arising out of my own experiences in the City of Birmingham, and my own constituency of Small Heath. One cannot consult the local people, and the local councillors have to make the best judgment that they can. They do very well in the circumstances, but they never know whether they have got it right. I never cease to be amazed by the problems which ordinary people regard as the most important in their lives.<br><br>
In the House and in local authorities we concentrate on those things which we think matter, but I find that the abolition of "EAST" in dialled telephone numbers in my constituency has caused far more distress to ordinary people than have some of the great issues of the day. When people want to ring up Mum, or the Church, they can remember "EAST 2345", but they cannot remember "896 2345". That is a matter of importance to ordinary people. If we had community councils they could be consulted on problems directly affecting their neighbourhoods. It may seem odd to open a discussion on neighbourhood councils by talking about telephone exchange numbers, but such questions are relevant to the lives of many people.<br><br>
In the past three years I have established three residents' associations in my constituency because we cannot have neigh-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0141">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 247</span>
bourhood community councils. When we ask people in the three bodies that I have established in my constituency what they think most important, so that we can get officials and councillors to talk about the problems affecting them, top of the list in each of the three residents' associations has been the road pattern, the transport habits, and the way in which lorry drivers get off overcrowded main roads into back roads, turning what were pleasant suburban neighbourhood roads into what the residents call race tracks—main road diversions.<br><br>
This has many profound effects. Obviously it disturbs the peace and quiet of the neighbourhood, and there is a grave element of danger to young children. In my constituency, because of the traffic dangers, there has emerged a demand for traffic-restricted roads, and roads in which children can play.<br><br>
Waiting restrictions are also of great importance. Vehicles and lorries park at all hours of the day and night in front of homes, giving offence, not only because of the parking itself but because, having parked their lorries, long-distance lorry drivers are in the habit of setting about their business at five o'clock in the morning, to the disturbance of everyone living in that neighbourhood.<br><br>
Some of us in the House, and others in town halls and county halls throughout the country, may not think that these matters are of much importance, but to those who have their sleep disturbed day after day they are probably among the most important matters in their lives. Yet at the moment there is no method whereby people are consulted, or can make representation collectively and authoritatively. In order to get a collective and authoritative representation even greater burdens must be imposed on local councillors and local Members of Parliament.<br><br>
I have already referred to recreation. This, and the whole field of leisure, is pre-eminently something for a neighbourhood or community council to take under its wing. I am often asked where one can kick a ball about in my constituency. In many of our towns there is nowhere to kick a ball about. I was brought up in the back streets of Birmingham, and I kicked balls about in the street because there was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 248</span>
nowhere else to do it. It was important to me to play football in the winter and cricket in the summer, and to chalk three stumps against a wall. However, the tremendous growth in the volume of traffic has made that a dangerous and hazardous business. If we had responded to the changing nature of our society, as the volume of traffic grew the amount of open space for leisure would also have grown. The two things go hand in hand. That has not happened, but there is tremendous demand for it and strong feeling about it.<br><br>
I had another aspect of leisure brought to my attention by some elderly people in my constituency, who told me that all the shops they used to use have gone, and that the nice new shopping centre is a mile away. The task of carrying the shopping from the new centre has made life much more difficult for them. That, again, is something that should be taken into account. These people were asking for certain leisure areas in which old people could come together and talk, or use them as staging posts between their homes and the shopping centre. That would be a trivial matter to a major local authority, but to the old people in that neighbourhood it is of major importance.<br><br>
Sport, leisure and recreation are of growing importance. The police and other authorities have many difficulties with young people which could be put down to boredom, a lack of facilities, and a lack of opportunity to enjoy their recreation and leisure. I am not sure that sports facilities would necessarily be used by the residents of a neighbourhood. In Birmingham we have done some interesting research, which shows that the youth of one district go to a neighbouring district to meet their girl friends, do their courting and enjoy their leisure, and the youth of that district go to yet another district. Perhaps the process could be called cross-fertilisation. It is one interesting fact that came out of the survey undertaken by the West Hill Training College for Youth Leaders.</span></p>
